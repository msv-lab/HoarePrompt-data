The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of words or values, and assigns it to the variable `data`. 

In the initial state, `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes. However, the code does not directly affect `a` and `b`. Instead, it introduces a new variable `data` which holds the input values.

Assuming the input is in the format of two space-separated values, the `data` variable will hold a list of two strings, where each string represents a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, `data` is a list of two input strings**
