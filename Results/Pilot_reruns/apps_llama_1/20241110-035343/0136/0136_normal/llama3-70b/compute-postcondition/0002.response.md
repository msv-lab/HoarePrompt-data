The code prints the string '='. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed, and '=' is printed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed, and '=' is printed.**
