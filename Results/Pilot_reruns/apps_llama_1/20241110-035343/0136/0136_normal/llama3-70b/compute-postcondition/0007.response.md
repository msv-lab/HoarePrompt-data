It seems like there's a mistake in the provided code snippet. The function definition is `def func():`, which doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `a` and `b` as strings representing non-negative integers.

Assuming the correct function definition is `def func(a, b):`, here's the step-by-step analysis:

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with at most 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.

Unfortunately, the output is not provided, so I'll leave the functionality description incomplete.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are strings representing non-negative integers with at most 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.**
