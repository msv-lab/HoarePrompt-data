The code `a = input().lstrip('0')` removes leading zeroes from the input string `a`. However, since `a` is already given as a string representing a non-negative integer with at most 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, the `input()` function will assign a new value to `a`, not the original value.

The `lstrip('0')` method removes leading zeroes from the new input string. If the new input string consists only of zeroes, `lstrip('0')` will result in an empty string.

The variable `b` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at most 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes**
