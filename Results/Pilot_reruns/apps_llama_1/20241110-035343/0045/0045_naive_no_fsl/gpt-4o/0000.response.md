Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with a sum equal to n and a greatest common divisor (GCD) that is maximal.

The program first calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k numbers, which is k*(k+1)/2. If this minimum sum is greater than n, it means that there is no possible sequence, and the program correctly returns -1.

If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, the program calculates the GCD of the sequence, which is n divided by the minimum sum. It then constructs the sequence by multiplying each number from 1 to k by the GCD and adding 1 to each number until the remainder (n - d*min_sum) is 0.

The program correctly handles the case where k is 1, in which case the sequence is simply [n]. It also correctly handles the case where n is a multiple of k, in which case the sequence is [n/k, n/k,..., n/k].

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
