Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with a sum equal to n and a maximal greatest common divisor. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program first checks if it's possible to create a sequence with a sum equal to n. It calculates the minimum possible sum of a sequence of k numbers (k * (k + 1) // 2) and checks if it's less than or equal to n. If it's not, the program returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to create a sequence.

2. If it's possible to create a sequence, the program calculates the greatest common divisor (d) of the sequence by dividing n by the minimum possible sum. This ensures that all numbers in the sequence will be divisible by d.

3. The program then generates the sequence by multiplying each number from 1 to k by d. This creates a sequence with a sum equal to n and a greatest common divisor of d.

4. Finally, the program distributes the remaining sum (n - d * min_sum) among the numbers in the sequence, starting from the last number and moving backwards. This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including cases where it's not possible to create a sequence (e.g., n = 5, k = 3). It also correctly generates sequences for cases where it is possible (e.g., n = 6, k = 3; n = 8, k = 2). 

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
