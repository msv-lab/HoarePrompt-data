Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 8 and k = 2, the program outputs 1 7, but the correct output should be 2 6, as the greatest common divisor of the sequence should be maximal.

The issue with the program is that it simply appends numbers from 1 to k to the sequence and subtracts them from n, without considering the greatest common divisor of the sequence. This approach does not guarantee that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal.

To fix this, the program should use a different approach, such as finding the greatest common divisor of n and k, and then constructing the sequence based on that.
