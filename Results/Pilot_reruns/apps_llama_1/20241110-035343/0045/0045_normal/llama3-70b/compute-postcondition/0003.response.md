To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given states.

The loop condition is `while b:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not zero (since in most programming languages, a non-zero value is considered `True` in a boolean context).

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`.
- `b` is the old value of `a`.

From the given information, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must not be zero. However, we are also given that `b` is the old value of `a`, and there is no direct information about the value of `b` (or the old value of `a`) being non-zero.

Since `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`, and given that `b` is the old value of `a`, we can imply that for `a` to be a valid remainder (which is always less than the divisor), the old value of `b` (which is the current `b`) must be greater than zero. This is because division by zero is undefined, and a remainder operation implies division has occurred.

However, since we are not given any information that directly contradicts the possibility of `b` being zero (other than the implication from the division operation), and given that `b` being non-zero is a requirement for the loop to continue, we need to explicitly state that `b` is not zero.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute one more time is:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a` and `b` is not zero**
