The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of the old `a` modulo the old `b`. The new value of `b` is the old value of `a`. 

The new value of `a` is `a % b`, which means it is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`. The new value of `b` is the old value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, `b` is the old value of `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer**
