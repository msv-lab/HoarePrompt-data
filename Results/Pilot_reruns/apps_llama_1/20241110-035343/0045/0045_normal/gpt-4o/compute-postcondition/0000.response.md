To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is a formula to calculate the sum of the first `k` positive integers.

Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` will also be a positive integer.

The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are positive integers, but the code snippet only uses `k` to calculate `min_sum`. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
