Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `d = n // min_sum` assigns the value of `n` divided by `min_sum` to the variable `d`. 

Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. However, since the code `d = n // min_sum` is executed, we can infer that `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, implying that `n` is greater than or equal to `min_sum`.

Since `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, we know that `min_sum` is a positive integer. Therefore, the division `n // min_sum` will result in a positive integer.

So, the value of `d` will be a positive integer, representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.**
