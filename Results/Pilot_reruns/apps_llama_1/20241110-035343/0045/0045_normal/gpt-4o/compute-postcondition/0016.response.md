To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `k - 3`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on the value of `i` and `k`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 2, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, and `i` is `k - 3**
