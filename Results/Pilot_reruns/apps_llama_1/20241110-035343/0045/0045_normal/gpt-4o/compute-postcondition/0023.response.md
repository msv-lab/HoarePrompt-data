Output State: **`remainder` is 0, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers where the first `k - remainder` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - remainder`, and the last `remainder` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from `k - remainder + 1` to `k` plus 1, `i` is -1, and the function returns the `sequence`. If `n` is equal to `min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`, `i` is -1, and the function returns the `sequence`.**
