Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the function's functionality.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. The annotations state that `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `b` is less than or equal to `a`. However, the code does not explicitly check for these conditions.

The function uses a while loop to calculate the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `b` is 0 initially, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `a` unchanged. This is not explicitly stated in the annotations.
* If `a` and `b` are not positive integers, the function's behavior is undefined. The annotations assume that `a` and `b` are positive integers, but the code does not enforce this.
* If `a` and `b` are negative integers, the function will still calculate the GCD correctly, but the annotations do not mention this case.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is 0 initially, the function returns `a` unchanged. The function does not enforce any constraints on the input values, so its behavior is undefined for non-integer or non-positive inputs. However, if `a` and `b` are integers (positive, negative, or zero), the function will correctly calculate their GCD. **
