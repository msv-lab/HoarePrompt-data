To solve this task, we need to analyze the given Python code and the initial state.

The code is: `a, b = b, a % b`

The initial state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k <= n`. However, the variables `a` and `b` are not defined in the initial state. Since `a` and `b` are used in the code, we need to assume that they are defined before the code execution. Let's assume that `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Now, let's analyze the code:

- The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`.
- After swapping, `a` is assigned the value of the original `b`.
- The new value of `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` (`a % b`).

Since we don't know the exact values of `a` and `b`, we can't calculate the exact output values. However, we can describe the output state based on the initial state and the code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.**
