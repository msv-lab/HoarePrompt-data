The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^10.

After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two possible cases:

Case 1: If the minimum sum `min_sum` (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.

Case 2: If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, the function returns a list of `k` integers, referred to as `sequence`. Each integer in the sequence is a multiple of a certain value `d` plus an additional value that ranges from 0 to `k - 1`, starting from the last element and decreasing by 1 for each element to the left.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return either -1 if the minimum sum exceeds `n`, or a sequence of `k` integers that follow a specific pattern based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, and returns either -1 if the minimum sum exceeds n, or a sequence of k integers following a specific pattern based on the values of n and k.**
