The code creates a new list `sequence` using a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over the range of `k` and calculates the value of `d * (i + 1)` for each iteration.

Since `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, the values in the `sequence` list will be multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d` for each iteration.

The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`.**
