Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` is 0, the loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues, with `remainder` being a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`.***
