To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. Based on the provided code, we can deduce the following:

* The loop iterates from `k - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
* The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, so its initial value should be `k - 1`.

Considering the given state, we need to adjust the following:

* `i` should be initialized to `k - 1` to match the loop counter.
* Since `k` is already a positive integer, we don't need to adjust its state.

The other variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`) are not directly related to the loop execution, so their states remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, `i` is `k - 1`**
