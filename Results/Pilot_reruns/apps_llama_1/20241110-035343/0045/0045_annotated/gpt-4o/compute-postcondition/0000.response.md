The code calculates the value of `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` will be the sum of the first `k` positive integers.

The initial state of `n` is not affected by this code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
