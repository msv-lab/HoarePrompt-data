To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1; otherwise, no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or `min_sum`, maintaining their initial values and relationships.

The code is:
```python
d = n // min_sum
```
This code assigns the value of `n` divided by `min_sum` to `d`. Since `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, the value of `d` will be the integer division of `n` by `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, but since the code is executed, we can assume that `min_sum` is not greater than `n`.

The output state will be the updated values of the variables. Since `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` maintain their initial values and relationships, the output state will be:

`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`**
