To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`
- `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`

Given Code:
```python
remainder -= 1
```

Now, let's think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` was a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, so the new value of `remainder` is also a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, but it can be zero if the initial value of `remainder` was 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`
- `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, but it can be zero if the initial value of `remainder` was 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, but it can be zero if the initial value of `remainder` was 1.**
