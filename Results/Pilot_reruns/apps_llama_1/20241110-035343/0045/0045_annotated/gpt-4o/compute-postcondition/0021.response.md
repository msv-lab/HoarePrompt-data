According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k - 4`. 

Additionally, since `i` is used to index the `sequence` list, the description of the `sequence` list should also be adjusted. The integer at index `k - 4` is now the one that is two more than a multiple of `d`, and the integer at index `k - 3` is now one more than a multiple of `d`. The last integer is still one more than a multiple of `d`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, except the integer at index `k - 4` which is two more than a multiple of `d`, and the integers at indices `k - 3` and `k - 1` are one more than a multiple of `d`, `i` is `k - 4`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**
