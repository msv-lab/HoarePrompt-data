To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means that the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than `-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by `1`, so `i` should be `k - 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`, `i` is `k - 2`, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, but it can be zero if the initial value of `remainder` was 1**
