Output State: **The loop distributes the remainder across the sequence list from right to left by incrementing each element by 1 until the remainder is 0 or the loop iterates k times. If the remainder is 0 before the loop starts, the sequence list remains unchanged. After the loop executes, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d` plus an additional value that is at most `k - 1` and at least 0, starting from the last element and decreasing by 1 for each element to the left, and `remainder` is 0 if the initial remainder was less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is the initial remainder minus `k`. If `k` is 1, the loop does not execute and `sequence` remains unchanged. `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.**
