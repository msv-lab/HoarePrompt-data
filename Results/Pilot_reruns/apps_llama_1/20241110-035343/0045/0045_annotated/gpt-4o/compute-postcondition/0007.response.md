Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, `i` is `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
