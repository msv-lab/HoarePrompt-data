According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, which means there is room for at least one more item for the loop to iterate over. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the `nested_list` must have at least 3 items. Since `item` is currently the second item in the list, for the next iteration, `item` should be the third item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, item is the third item in the list.**
