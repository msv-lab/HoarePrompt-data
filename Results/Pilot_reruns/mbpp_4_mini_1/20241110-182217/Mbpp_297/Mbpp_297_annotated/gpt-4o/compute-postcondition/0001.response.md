According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Since `flat_list` is empty and is not relevant to the execution of the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. At the start of the loop, `item` will be assigned the first element of `nested_list`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, and `item` should be the first item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the nested_list, `flat_list` is an empty list**
