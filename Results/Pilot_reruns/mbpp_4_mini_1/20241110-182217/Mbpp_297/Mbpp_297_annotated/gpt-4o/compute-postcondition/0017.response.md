Functionality: ** The function accepts a nested list (`nested_list`) that may contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both. It returns a flattened list (`flat_list`) containing all integers found within `nested_list`, preserving the order of elements. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be empty. If `nested_list` contains only non-list items, those items will be returned directly in `flat_list`. The function correctly handles multiple levels of nesting and any combination of integers and lists, ensuring that all integers are extracted and returned in a single, flat structure.**
