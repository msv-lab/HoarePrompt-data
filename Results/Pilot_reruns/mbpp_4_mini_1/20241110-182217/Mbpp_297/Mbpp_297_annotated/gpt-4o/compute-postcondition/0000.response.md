The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `nested_list` remains unaffected, and no values are changed or returned. Therefore, the output state reflects the current status of the variables.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both; `flat_list` is an empty list**
