According to the code, the loop iterates over `nested_list`, which currently has at least 1 item. At the end of the last iteration, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items, so that the next `item` can be the second item in the list. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list**
