The statement appends `item` to `flat_list`. The value of `item` is derived from the second item in the `nested_list`, which is currently unknown, but the action of appending will add this value to `flat_list`. The previous values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` are not altered except for the addition of `item`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged state of `nested_list` and the updated state of `flat_list`, which now contains the `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `flat_list` now includes the second item of `nested_list`**
