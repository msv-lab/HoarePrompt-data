The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state will reflect the current state of `flat_list`.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`.**
