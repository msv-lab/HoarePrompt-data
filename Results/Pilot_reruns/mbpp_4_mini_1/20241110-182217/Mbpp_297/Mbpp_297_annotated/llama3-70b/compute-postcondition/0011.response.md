The code appends `element`, which is the third element of `nested_list`, to `flat_list`. The values of `nested_list` and `element` are known, but `flat_list` is assumed to be an existing list that will now include the third element of `nested_list`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` now includes `element`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` now includes `element`**
