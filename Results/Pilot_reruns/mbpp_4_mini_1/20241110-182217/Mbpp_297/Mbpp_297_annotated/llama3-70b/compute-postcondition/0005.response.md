According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element. To execute the loop one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements. Additionally, the `element` must be updated to reflect the next element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, element is the second element of `nested_list`**
