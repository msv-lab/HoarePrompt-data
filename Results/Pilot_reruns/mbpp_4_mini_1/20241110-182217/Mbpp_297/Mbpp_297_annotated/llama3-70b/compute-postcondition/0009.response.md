According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and the loop processes each element in `nested_list`, we need to ensure that the next iteration will process the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `element` should now be the third element of `nested_list`, and thus the length of `nested_list` must be at least 3 to allow for this. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element of `nested_list`.**
