The code appends `element`, which is the second element of `nested_list`, to `flat_list`. The state of `flat_list` changes to include `element`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` now contains the second element appended to it.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has `element` appended to it**.
