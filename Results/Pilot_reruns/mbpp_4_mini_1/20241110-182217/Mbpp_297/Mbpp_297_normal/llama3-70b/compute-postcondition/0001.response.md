According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is initially empty but does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain as it is. At the start of the loop, `element` should be initialized to the first element of `nested_list`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least one element, and `element` should refer to the first element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
