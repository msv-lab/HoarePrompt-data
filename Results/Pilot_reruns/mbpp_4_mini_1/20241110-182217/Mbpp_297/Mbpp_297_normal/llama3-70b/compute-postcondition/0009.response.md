According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `element` is the second element of `nested_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements, and `element` would need to be the third element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element of `nested_list`, and if `element` is a list, then `flat_list` will be extended by the result of `func_1(element)`; otherwise, `flat_list` includes the third element of `nested_list`.**
