The function `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` will modify `flat_list` by extending it with the return value of `func_1(element)`. The value of `element` is the third element of `nested_list`. If `element` is a list, `flat_list` will be extended with the result of `func_1(element)`; otherwise, it will not affect `flat_list`.

Since we do not have the specific implementation of `func_1` or the actual values of `nested_list` and `flat_list`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `flat_list` after execution. However, we can conclude that if `element` is a list, `flat_list` will include the results of `func_1(element)`.

Thus, based on the initial information provided:
- If `element` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`.
- If `element` is not a list, `flat_list` remains unchanged based on this operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `flat_list` has been updated according to the type of `element`.

Output State: **`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` remains unchanged.**
