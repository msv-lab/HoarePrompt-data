The code appends `element` to `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least one element, and `element` is the first element of `nested_list`. Since `flat_list` is initially empty, after executing the code, `flat_list` will contain one element: `element`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
