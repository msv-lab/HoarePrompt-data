The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` extends `flat_list` by adding the result of `func_1(element)` to it. Given that `nested_list` has at least one element, `element` is defined as the first element of `nested_list`. The state of `flat_list` changes as it will now include the values returned by `func_1(element)`. The specific values returned by `func_1(element)` are not known, but they will be added to `flat_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is updated with the result of `func_1(element)`, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
