The function accepts a list called `nested_list`, which may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and returns a flattened list containing all integers found within `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty or contains only empty lists, the function returns an empty list. If the input is a list of non-list items, those elements are directly included in the returned list.
