The function accepts a list named `nested_list`, which may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists, and returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty, it returns an empty list. The function does not modify the original list structure and handles any type of element within the lists correctly.
