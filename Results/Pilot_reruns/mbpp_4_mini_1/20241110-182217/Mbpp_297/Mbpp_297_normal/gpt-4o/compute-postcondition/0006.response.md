The `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the second element in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` has at least two elements, `item` will have a valid value, and the function `func_1(item)` will return a value that can be extended to `flat_list`. The previous state of `flat_list` is not altered except for the addition of the new elements from `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)` where `item` is the second element in `nested_list`**
