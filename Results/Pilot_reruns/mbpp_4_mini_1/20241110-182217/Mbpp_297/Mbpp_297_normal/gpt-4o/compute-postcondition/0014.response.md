Output State: **`flat_list` will contain all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute and `flat_list` remains empty. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, `item` will be the first element in `nested_list` on the first execution, the second on the second execution, and so on. The loop can handle any elements in `nested_list`, regardless of their type, but will not execute if `nested_list` is empty.**
