The code extends `flat_list` by adding the result of `func_1(item)`. The variable `item` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `nested_list` has at least 3 elements. The output does not change the values of `nested_list` or `item`, but it modifies `flat_list` by appending the results of `func_1(item)`. Since the specific output of `func_1(item)` is unknown, we cannot define it precisely. Therefore, the output state will indicate the current state of all variables involved.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`**.
