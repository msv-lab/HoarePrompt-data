According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has more than 1 element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, and `item` is the first element in `nested_list`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `item` should be the second element in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is either extended with the result of `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list or contains the first element of `nested_list`, item is the second element in `nested_list`**
