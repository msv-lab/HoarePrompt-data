The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or other nested lists. After executing the function body, `flat_list` is produced as a result of processing `nested_list`, which may be empty or contain elements based on the input. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a flattened version of that list, which may be empty or contain the processed elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists, and returns a flattened version of nested_list.**
