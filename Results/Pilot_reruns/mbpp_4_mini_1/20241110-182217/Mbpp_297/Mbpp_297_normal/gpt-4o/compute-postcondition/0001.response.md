According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is initially empty and there is no condition on it for the loop execution, it is not relevant for the loop to run. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must have at least one item, and `item` should be the first element of `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`**
