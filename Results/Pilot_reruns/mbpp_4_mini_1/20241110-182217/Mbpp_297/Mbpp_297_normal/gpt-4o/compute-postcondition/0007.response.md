The code appends `item` to `flat_list`. The value of `item` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended with this value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is extended with the second element of `nested_list`, and `item` is the second element in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is extended with the second element of `nested_list`, `item` is the second element in `nested_list`**
