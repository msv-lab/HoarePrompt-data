According to the code, the loop iterates over `nested_list`. To execute one more time, the state of `nested_list` should reflect the next element after the current one. Since the state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 2 elements and the previous iteration processed the second element, the next element to be processed will be the third element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must now have at least 3 elements, and `item` should be the third element in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, item is the third element in `nested_list`**
