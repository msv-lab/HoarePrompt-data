Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it appends it directly to `flat_list`. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various nested list inputs, producing the expected flattened output. 

The implementation handles lists of arbitrary depth and correctly flattens them into a single list of elements. There are no identified edge cases or inputs where the program fails to meet the requirement stated in the problem description.
