Correctness: **False**

The provided code `func_1(s)` is designed to convert a string `s` to uppercase using the `upper()` method. However, the annotations highlight a critical limitation: the function does not handle cases where `s` is not a string or is `None`. This is significant because if the function is called with a non-string input (for example, an integer or a list), it will raise an `AttributeError` since those types do not have the `upper()` method.

For instance, consider the following edge case:
- If `s` is `None`, calling `s.upper()` will raise an error.
- If `s` is an integer (e.g., `123`), it will also raise an error.

These examples illustrate that the function does not meet the problem description's requirement to handle all potential cases of input, specifically inputs that are not strings or are `None`. Since the function fails for these valid inputs, it cannot be considered correct.

The annotations confirm this limitation by stating that the function "does not handle cases where `s` is not a string or is `None`", which directly impacts the function's correctness according to the problem description. Thus, the function's failure to handle these cases leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect overall.
