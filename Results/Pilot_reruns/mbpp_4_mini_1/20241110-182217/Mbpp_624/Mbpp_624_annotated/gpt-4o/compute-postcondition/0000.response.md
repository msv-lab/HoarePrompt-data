The function returns `s.upper()`, which converts the string `s` to uppercase. The previous value of `s` remains unchanged, and the return statement does not alter the state of the other variable. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string, and the function returns the uppercase version of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and the function returns `s.upper()`**
