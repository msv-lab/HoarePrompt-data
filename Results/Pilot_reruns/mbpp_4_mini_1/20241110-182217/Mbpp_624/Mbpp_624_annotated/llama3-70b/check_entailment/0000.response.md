Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle cases where the input `s` is not a string, as indicated in the annotations. The function `func_1` calls the `upper()` method on `s`, which will raise an `AttributeError` if `s` is of a type that does not have this method (for example, if `s` is an integer or a list). 

The problem description requires that the function should convert a given string to uppercase. However, it does not mention how to handle cases where the input is not a string, which is a significant oversight. The annotations explicitly state that "It does not handle cases where `s` is not a string," confirming that the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Thus, since the program does not correctly address all possible inputs as implied by the problem description, the correctness is determined to be false.
