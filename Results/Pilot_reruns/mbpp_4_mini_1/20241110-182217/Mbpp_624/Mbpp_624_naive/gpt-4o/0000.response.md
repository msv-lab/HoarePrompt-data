Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly converts any given string `s` to uppercase using the built-in string method `.upper()`. The provided assertions confirm that it works for the test cases 'person', 'final', and 'Valid', returning 'PERSON', 'FINAL', and 'VALID' respectively. Since the uppercase conversion is a standard operation in Python and the function handles typical input strings correctly, there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause it to fail based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements perfectly.
