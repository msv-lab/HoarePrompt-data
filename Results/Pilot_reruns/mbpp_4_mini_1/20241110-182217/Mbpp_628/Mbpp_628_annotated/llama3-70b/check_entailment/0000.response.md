Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where the input `s` is `None` or not a string, which could lead to errors. According to the problem description, the function should be able to replace all spaces in a given string with '%20'. However, if `s` is `None`, the program will raise an AttributeError because `None` does not have a `replace` method. 

The annotations point out that the function does not handle cases where `s` is not a string. This is an important consideration, as the problem description implies that `s` should always be a string. Therefore, the function's inability to handle `None` and non-string inputs demonstrates that it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. 

For example:
- If `s = None`, calling `func_1(s)` would raise an error.
- If `s = 123` (an integer), it would also raise an error since integers do not have the `replace` method.

Thus, because the program does not correctly handle these edge cases, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
