To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break it down step by step.

**Problem description:** The task is to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(input_string):
    return input_string.replace(' ', '%20')
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a string `input_string` and returns the string with all spaces replaced by '%20'. It does not handle any other characters or edge cases, such as leading or trailing spaces or empty strings, but it will still execute and return the appropriate result for those cases.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality:** The function uses `replace()` to change every space `' '` in the input string to `'%20'`. This seems to directly satisfy the requirement of replacing spaces as per the problem description.
2. **Possible Edge Cases:** 
   - Leading spaces: For example, for input `' Hello World'`, it should return `'%20Hello%20World'`.
   - Trailing spaces: For example, for input `'Hello World '` should return `'Hello%20World%20'`.
   - Multiple consecutive spaces: For input `'Hello  World'`, it should return `'Hello%20%20World'`.
   - Empty string: For input `''`, it should return `''` (which is correct).
   - Strings with no spaces: For input `'HelloWorld'`, it should return `'HelloWorld'`.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function does not handle edge cases like leading or trailing spaces but will still execute and return appropriate results. This suggests that while the function handles the basic case of replacing spaces, it does not account for how leading or trailing spaces should be treated. This means the function does not strictly adhere to the problem description in all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle cases like leading and trailing spaces properly, which are significant edge cases in this context. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to correctly process strings with leading or trailing spaces, as it will not appropriately handle these edge cases, leading to incorrect outputs for such inputs.
