The function returns `result_list`, which is a sorted list based on the previous operations. The values of `list1`, `set1`, `set2`, and `diff_elements` do not change with this return statement. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of `list1`, `set1`, `set2`, `diff_elements`, and indicates that the function returns `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements of `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, and the function returns `result_list`**
