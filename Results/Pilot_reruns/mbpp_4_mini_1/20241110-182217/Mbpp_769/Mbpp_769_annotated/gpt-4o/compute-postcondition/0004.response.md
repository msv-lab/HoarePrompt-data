The `result_list` is sorted based on the index of its elements in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. The sorting does not change the elements of `result_list`, but it arranges them in an order dictated by their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements of `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is now sorted according to the specified criteria.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements of `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is now sorted according to the specified criteria.**
