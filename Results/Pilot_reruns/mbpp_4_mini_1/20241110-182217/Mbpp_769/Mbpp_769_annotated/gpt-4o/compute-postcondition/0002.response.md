The variable `diff_elements` is assigned the value of the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. The previous values of `set1` and `set2` are unaffected, and they continue to represent the unique elements of `list1` and `list2` respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the sets involved and the calculated symmetric difference.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements of `list2`, and `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`.**
