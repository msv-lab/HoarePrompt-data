The line of code `set1 = set(list1)` converts `list1` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements and stores the unique elements. The previous values of `list1` are preserved, and `set1` will now contain the unique elements of `list1`. The state of `list2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, and `list2` remains a list containing elements of any type.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `list2` is a list containing elements of any type**
