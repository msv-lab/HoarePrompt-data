The code performs a symmetric difference operation between `list1` and `list2` by converting them to sets and using the `^` operator. This operation results in a set of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The set is then converted back to a list and sorted. 

Since `list1` and `list2` can contain elements of any type and their specific contents are not provided, the output state will reflect that the function returns a sorted list of unique elements from both lists that are not shared.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements of any type, and the function returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to each list.**
