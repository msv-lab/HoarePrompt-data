The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that can contain any type of elements. The function processes these lists to derive two sets: `set1`, which contains the unique elements from `list1`, and `set2`, which contains the unique elements from `list2`. The function then computes the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`, resulting in `diff_elements`. Finally, the function returns `result_list`, which is derived from `diff_elements`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, compute the symmetric difference of their unique elements, and return the result as a list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a list containing the symmetric difference of the unique elements from both lists.**
