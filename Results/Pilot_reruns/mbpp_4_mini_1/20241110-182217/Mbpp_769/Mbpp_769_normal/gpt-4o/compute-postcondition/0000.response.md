The variable `set1` is assigned the value of `set(list1)`, which converts `list1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements. The values of `list2` and `set1` do not affect each other. Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements.

Output State: **`list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements**
