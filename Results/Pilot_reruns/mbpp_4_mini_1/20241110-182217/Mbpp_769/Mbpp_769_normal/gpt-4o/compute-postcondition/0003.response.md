The code assigns `result_list` the value of `list(diff_elements)`, which converts the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2` into a list. The values of `list1`, `set1`, `set2`, and `diff_elements` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values and the newly created `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements; `set2` is a set derived from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; `result_list` is a list derived from `diff_elements`.**
