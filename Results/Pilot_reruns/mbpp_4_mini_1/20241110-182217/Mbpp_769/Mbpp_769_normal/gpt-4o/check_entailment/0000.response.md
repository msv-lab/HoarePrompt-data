To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a Python function that gets the difference between two lists, meaning it should return the unique elements from both lists (symmetric difference) in a sorted order based on their original positions in the concatenated lists.

**Code Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    result_list = list(diff_elements)
    result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
    return result_list
```
- The function converts both lists to sets, computes the symmetric difference, and then sorts the result based on the index of each element in the concatenated version of both lists.
- This approach correctly identifies unique elements from both lists and sorts them according to their original order.

**Output Hints:**
- The hints state that the function accepts two lists and returns a sorted list of unique elements from each list, based on their original order. It also mentions that if both lists are empty, it returns an empty list and that it handles any type of elements.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
1. **Both lists are empty:** The function should return an empty list, which is consistent with the output hints.
2. **One list is empty:** If `list1` is empty and `list2` contains elements, the function should return the elements of `list2`, and vice versa.
3. **Identical lists:** If both lists contain the same elements, the function should return an empty list.
4. **Different data types:** The function should handle lists containing mixed data types (e.g., integers and strings). 

**Testing Edge Cases:**
1. `func_1([], [])` should return `[]`.
2. `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3], [])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])` should return `[]`.
5. `func_1([1, 'a', 2], ['a', 3])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.

**Conclusion:**
Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, the code appears to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the provided examples and potential edge cases. 

The output hints align with the functionality of the code, confirming that it returns the symmetric difference of two lists and sorts the result based on their original positions.

Correctness: **True**.
