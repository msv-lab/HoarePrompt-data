The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to each list (the symmetric difference). The sorting is based on their original order in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. If both lists are empty, it returns an empty list. The function handles any type of elements present in the input lists.
