To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly computes the difference between two lists as described in the problem statement.

The function `func_1` uses the `symmetric_difference` method of sets to find elements that are in either of the two lists but not in both. This means it returns the elements that are unique to each list.

Here's the breakdown of the assertions:

1. **First Assertion**: 
   - `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])` returns `[10, 20, 30, 15]`.
   - This is correct because the elements unique to the first list are `10`, `15`, `20`, and `30`, while `25`, `40`, and `35` are in the second list.

2. **Second Assertion**: 
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])` returns `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - This is also correct because `1` is common, while `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` are unique to the first list and `6`, `7` are unique to the second list.

3. **Third Assertion**: 
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])` returns `[2, 3, 6, 7]`.
   - This is again correct as `1` is common, and `2`, `3` are unique to the first list while `6`, `7` are unique to the second list.

However, the function does not account for the order of elements in the final output when sorting based on the index in the combined list (`list1 + list2`). The sorting is based on the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list, which might not match the expected output in every case.

For example:
- If we call `func_1([1, 2], [2, 3])`, the expected output should be `[1, 3]`, but the actual output would be `[1, 3]`, which is correct. However, if we modify the input slightly, such as `func_1([1, 2, 3], [2, 3])`, we should expect `[1]`, but the function would return `[1]`, which is correct.

Despite the correct outputs for the examples tested, a potential edge case could arise with more complex inputs, specifically around the order of elements.

Therefore, since we have not found a case where the function fails but also considering the complexity of the sorting logic, we can conclude that the function behaves as expected based on the examples provided.

To summarize:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly computes the difference between the two lists based on the symmetric difference logic and returns the elements in the expected order based on their first appearance in the combined list of inputs.
