According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup` variable. If `tup` is not empty, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, we need to consider the state of `elem`, which will represent the current element of `tup`. For the loop to execute, `tup` must contain at least one element. 

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to indicate that `tup` has at least one element, and `elem` should be set to the first element of `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`**
