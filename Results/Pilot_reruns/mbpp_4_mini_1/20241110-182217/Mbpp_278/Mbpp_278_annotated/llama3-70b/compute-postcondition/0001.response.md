The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the first element of `tup`, its index is `0`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0**
