According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the tuple `tup`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tup` must have at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element of `tup`. To prepare for the next iteration, we need to set `elem` to the third element of `tup`, and `tup` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`**
