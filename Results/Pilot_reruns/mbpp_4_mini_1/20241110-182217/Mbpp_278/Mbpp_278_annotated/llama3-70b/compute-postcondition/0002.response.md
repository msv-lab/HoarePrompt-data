Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple itself, the function returns 0, indicating that `elem` is found at the first position of `tup`. There are no actions defined for cases where `elem` is not a tuple, but it is implicit that the behavior remains unchanged in such scenarios.***
