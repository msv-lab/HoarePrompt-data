The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain elements, including other tuples. If `tup` contains at least one element, the function iterates through the elements and returns the index of the first tuple element found. If no tuple is present in `tup`, the function returns the length of `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function implicitly returns `None`, indicating no tuple was found. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the index of the first tuple element found within it, or the length of the tuple if no nested tuples are present, and return `None` if the tuple is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, returns the index of the first tuple element found in tup, or the length of tup if no tuple is present, and returns None if tup is empty.**
