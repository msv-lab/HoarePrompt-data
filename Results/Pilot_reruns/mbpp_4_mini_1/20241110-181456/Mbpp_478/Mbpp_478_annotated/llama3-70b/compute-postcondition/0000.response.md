The function returns a string that consists of only the uppercase characters from `s`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string containing both uppercase and lowercase characters. The return statement does not change the state of `s`, but it produces a new string composed of the uppercase characters found in `s`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the current value of `s` and indicates the return value. 

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain both uppercase and lowercase characters, and the function returns a string of uppercase characters from `s`**
