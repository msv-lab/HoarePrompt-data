Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the problem description, which requires removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only retains uppercase characters, effectively removing all lowercase and non-alphabetical characters, which does not align with the requirement of removing "lowercase substrings".

For example, consider the input string `"HeLLo World"`. The expected behavior based on the problem description would be to remove the lowercase substring `"eLL"` (the entire lowercase part when reading lowercase letters together), resulting in `"H W"`. However, the program returns `"H L W"`, which indicates that it does not properly implement the expected logic for removing lowercased substrings as described. 

Hence, the program is incorrect.
