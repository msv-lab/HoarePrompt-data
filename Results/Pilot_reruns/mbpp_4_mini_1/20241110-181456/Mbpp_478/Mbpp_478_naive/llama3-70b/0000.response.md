Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to remove all lowercase substrings from the given string `s`. It achieves this by iterating over each character in the string and including only the uppercase characters in the resulting string. 

For example, given the input string "Hello World", the function would return "HW", as it correctly removes the lowercase letters 'e', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r', and 'l', and retains the uppercase letters 'H' and 'W'.

Additionally, if the input string contains only lowercase characters, such as "hello", the function would return an empty string, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Overall, the function handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description.
