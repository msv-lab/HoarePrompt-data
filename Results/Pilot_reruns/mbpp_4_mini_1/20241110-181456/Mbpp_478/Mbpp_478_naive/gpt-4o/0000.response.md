Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by filtering out characters that are not uppercase. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string `s` and checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`. If it is uppercase, it is included in the result. 

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:
- For the input 'PYTHon', it correctly returns 'PYTH'.
- For the input 'FInD', it returns 'FID'.
- For the input 'STRinG', it returns 'STRG'.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and there are no edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the problem description, the program is correct.
