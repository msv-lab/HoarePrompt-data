Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality of counting occurrences of an element in a tuple using the `count` method, which is a built-in method specifically designed for this purpose. The method will accurately count the number of times `elem` appears in `tup` for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as:

- An empty tuple: `func_1((), 1)` should return `0`.
- A tuple with no occurrences of the element: `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` should also return `0`.
- A tuple where the element appears multiple times: `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)` should return `2`.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly, it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
