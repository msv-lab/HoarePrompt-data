Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` of any data type, and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation, as it directly utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples to produce the result. **
