The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple, and a parameter `elem`, which is an element whose occurrences in `tup` need to be counted. After executing the function body, it returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and return the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup (a tuple) and an element elem, and returns the count of occurrences of elem in tup.**
