The function returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The value of `tup` is not provided, so the count of `elem` in `tup` is unknown. The return statement does not change the state of `tup` or `elem`. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple, `elem` is an element, and the function returns `tup.count(elem)`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `elem` is an element, and the function returns `tup.count(elem)`**
