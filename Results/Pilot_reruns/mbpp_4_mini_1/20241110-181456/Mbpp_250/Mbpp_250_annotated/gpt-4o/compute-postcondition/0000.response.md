The function returns the count of `element` in the tuple `tup`. As the initial state indicates that `tup` is a tuple and `element` can be of any data type, the output will depend on the specific values within `tup` and `element`. However, since those values are not provided, we cannot specify the exact count. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple, `element` is of any data type, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `element` is of any data type, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`**
