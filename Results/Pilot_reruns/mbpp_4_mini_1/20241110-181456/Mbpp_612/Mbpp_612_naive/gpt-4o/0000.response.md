Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the sublists do not have exactly two elements. For example, if the input is `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])`, it would raise an `IndexError` because the program assumes that every sublist has at least two elements. This means that the function fails for valid inputs that do not conform to the expected format, violating the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
