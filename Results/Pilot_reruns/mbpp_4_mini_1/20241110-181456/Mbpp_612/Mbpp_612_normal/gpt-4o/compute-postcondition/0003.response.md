The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it extracts the first elements from each sublist into a list called `first_elements` and the second elements into a list called `second_elements`. The function then returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return a list containing two lists: one with the first elements of each sublist and another with the second elements of each sublist. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists and returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains the first elements of each sublist, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist.**
