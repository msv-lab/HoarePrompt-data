Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain at least two elements. It extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them as two separate lists within a list. However, if any sublist contains fewer than two elements, it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function effectively assumes that each sublist has exactly two elements. **
