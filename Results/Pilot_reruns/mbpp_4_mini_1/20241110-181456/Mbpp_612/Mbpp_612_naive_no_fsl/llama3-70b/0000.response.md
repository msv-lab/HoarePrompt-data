To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code closely.

### Problem Description
The function should take a list of lists, where each sublist contains two elements. It should return a list of two lists:
1. The first list should contain the first elements of each sublist.
2. The second list should contain the second elements of each sublist.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list((element[0] for element in list_of_lists)), list((element[1] for element in list_of_lists))]
```

- The program uses a list comprehension to create two separate lists:
  - The first list contains the first elements from each sublist.
  - The second list contains the second elements from each sublist.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Empty Input**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the output should be `[[], []]`.
2. **Single Element Sublists**: If `list_of_lists` contains sublists with only one element each, this case should still be handled correctly. For example, if `list_of_lists = [[1], [2]]`, it should return `[[1, 2], []]`.
3. **Sublists with Different Data Types**: The function should handle sublists containing different data types correctly. For example, if `list_of_lists = [[1, 'a'], [2, 'b']]`, it should return `[[1, 2], ['a', 'b']]`.
4. **Invalid Sublists**: If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, the program will raise an `IndexError`. For example, `list_of_lists = [[1], [2]]` will cause an error.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle various edge cases, particularly when the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. Therefore, it's incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Incorrectness
- Input: `list_of_lists = [[1], [2]]`
- Expected Output: `[[1, 2], []]`
- Actual Output: Raises `IndexError` because it tries to access `element[1]` for the first sublist which only has one element.
