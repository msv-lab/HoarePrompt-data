Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements, which is a requirement based on the problem description. For example, if we provide an input like `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])`, the program will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element (`sublist[1]`) of the first sublist, which does not exist. 

This shows that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, specifically when sublists have fewer than two elements. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
