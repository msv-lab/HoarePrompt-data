The function returns two values: the absolute value of the complex number `c` and the phase of the complex number `c`. The absolute value and phase are calculated using `abs(c)` and `cmath.phase(c)`, respectively. The return statement does not affect the state of any variable, so the output state reflects the current values of `c` along with the returned values.

Output State: **`c` is a complex number, and the function returns abs(c) and cmath.phase(c)**
