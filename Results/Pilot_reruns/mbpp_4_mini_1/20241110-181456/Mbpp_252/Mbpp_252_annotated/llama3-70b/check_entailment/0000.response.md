Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a complex number to its polar coordinates by returning the absolute value and phase angle in radians. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to accept a complex number `c` and returns a tuple containing `abs(c)` and `cmath.phase(c)`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Additionally, the output of the function will be accurate for any valid complex number input, including edge cases such as zero (`0 + 0j`), where the absolute value will be `0` and the phase angle is typically defined as `0`. The function will also handle positive and negative real and imaginary parts appropriately, producing correct results for all possible scenarios involving complex numbers.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct in every case.
