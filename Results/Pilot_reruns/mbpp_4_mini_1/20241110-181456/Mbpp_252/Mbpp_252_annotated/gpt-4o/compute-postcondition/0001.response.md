The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a string that represents a complex number in the form 'a+bj', where a and b are real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `num` that represents a complex number and return its polar coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, which is a string representing a complex number, and returns the polar coordinates of that complex number.**
