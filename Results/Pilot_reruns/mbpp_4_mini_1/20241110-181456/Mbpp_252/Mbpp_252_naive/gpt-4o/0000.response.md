To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates, let’s analyze the program carefully.

The function `func_1` uses `cmath.polar`, which is a standard library function designed to convert complex numbers to their polar coordinates. The return value of `cmath.polar(complex(num))` is a tuple containing the magnitude (r) and phase (θ) of the complex number.

However, the problem description suggests that the function should convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. It's important to note that the input `num` should be able to handle complex numbers as well, not just real numbers. 

Let's consider some cases:

1. **Real Numbers**: The assertions provided in the program check the function for real inputs (1, 4, 5). The results for these inputs are:
   - `func_1(1)` returns `(1.0, 0.0)`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(4)` returns `(4.0, 0.0)`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(5)` returns `(5.0, 0.0)`, which is correct.

2. **Complex Numbers**: The program does not handle complex inputs. For example:
   - If we call `func_1(1 + 1j)`, the expected output should be `(√2, π/4)`, but this case is not tested or handled in the assertions.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program also does not account for other edge cases like:
   - Input `0`, which should return `(0.0, 0.0)`.
   - Negative inputs, such as `-1`, which should return `(1.0, π)`.

Since the program does not handle complex numbers or various edge cases properly, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
