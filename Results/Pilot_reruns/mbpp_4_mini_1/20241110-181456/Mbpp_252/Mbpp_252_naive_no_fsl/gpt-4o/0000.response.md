Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases for converting complex numbers to polar coordinates. For example, it does not account for complex numbers with an imaginary part, such as `func_1(1 + 1j)`, which should return `(sqrt(2), Ï€/4)`. This oversight means the function fails to correctly convert complex numbers that have both real and imaginary components, violating the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not work for all valid inputs.
