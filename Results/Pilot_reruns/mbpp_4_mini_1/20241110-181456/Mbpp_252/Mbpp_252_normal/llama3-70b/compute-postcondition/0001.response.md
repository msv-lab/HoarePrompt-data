The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`. `c` is a complex number. After executing the function body, it returns two values: the absolute value of `c`, which is `abs(c)`, and the phase of `c`, which is `cmath.phase(c)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a complex number `c` and return its absolute value and phase. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter c, which is a complex number, and returns its absolute value and phase.**
