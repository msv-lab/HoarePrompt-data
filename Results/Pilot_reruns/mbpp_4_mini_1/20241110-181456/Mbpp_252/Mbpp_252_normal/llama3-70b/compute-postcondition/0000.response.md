The function returns the absolute value of the complex number `c` and the phase (or angle) of `c`. The value of `c` as a complex number does not change during this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the absolute value and the phase of `c` while noting that the function returns these two values.

Output State: **`c` is a complex number, and the function returns abs(c), cmath.phase(c)**
