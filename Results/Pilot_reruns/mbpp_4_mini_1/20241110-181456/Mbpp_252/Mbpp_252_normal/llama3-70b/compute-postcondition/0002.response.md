Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number `c` and returns a tuple containing its absolute value and phase angle. It computes these values using the `abs` function and `cmath.phase`, which are standard operations for complex numbers. There are no edge cases or missing functionality, as the operations are defined for all complex numbers. **
