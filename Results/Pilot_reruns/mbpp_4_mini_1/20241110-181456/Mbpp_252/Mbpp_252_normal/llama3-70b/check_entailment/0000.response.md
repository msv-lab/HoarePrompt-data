The provided program aims to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates by returning a tuple containing the absolute value and phase angle of the complex number. The implementation uses Python's `abs` function for calculating the absolute value and `cmath.phase` for the phase angle, both of which are standard and appropriate for handling complex numbers.

Upon initial assessment, the code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The program should handle all valid complex numbers, including both real and imaginary parts, as well as zero, since the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions are designed to work with any complex input.

Next, we consider the output hints, which state that the function accepts a complex number `c` and returns a tuple containing its absolute value and phase angle. Furthermore, it mentions that there are no edge cases or missing functionality, which aligns with the functionality of the code.

Since the operations of calculating the absolute value and phase angle are well-defined and reliable for all complex numbers, we do not find any examples or edge cases where the code would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Given this analysis, both the code and the output hints are consistent and confirm that the program handles all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
