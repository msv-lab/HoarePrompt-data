To evaluate the provided program and its correctness, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the maximum of two numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a > b else b
```

**Assertions:**
```python
assert func_1(5, 10) == 10
assert func_1(-1, -2) == -1
assert func_1(9, 7) == 9
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two comparable parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater of the two values. If both are equal, it returns either `a` or `b`, as they are the same.

**Initial Assessment:**
The function `func_1` is designed to return the maximum of two numbers, `a` and `b`. The logic `return a if a > b else b` is straightforward. It will return `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, and it will return `b` otherwise. This includes the case where both numbers are equal, in which case it will return either one since they are the same.

**Edge cases to consider:**
1. Both numbers being equal (e.g., `func_1(5, 5)`).
2. Both numbers being negative (e.g., `func_1(-3, -2)`).
3. One number being zero (e.g., `func_1(0, -1)`).
4. Different types of comparable values (e.g., `func_1(5.5, 5)`).

The program seems to handle these cases correctly based on the logic in the function.

**Output Hints Verification:**
The hints mention that if both parameters are equal, the function will return either `a` or `b`, which aligns with the logic of the function. The hints also confirm that the function returns the greater of the two values.

Now, let's consider the assertions provided:
- `func_1(5, 10)` → returns `10`, which is correct.
- `func_1(-1, -2)` → returns `-1`, which is correct.
- `func_1(9, 7)` → returns `9`, which is correct.

**Conclusion:**
The code appears to follow the problem description correctly and handles all relevant cases. There are no apparent edge cases in the problem description that the code does not accommodate.

Correctness: **True**.
