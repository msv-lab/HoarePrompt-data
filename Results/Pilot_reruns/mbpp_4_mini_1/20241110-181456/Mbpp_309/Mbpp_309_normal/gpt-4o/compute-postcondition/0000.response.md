The code returns `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are comparable, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that the function will return either `a` or `b` depending on their comparison.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are comparable, and the function returns either `a` or `b` depending on which is greater**
