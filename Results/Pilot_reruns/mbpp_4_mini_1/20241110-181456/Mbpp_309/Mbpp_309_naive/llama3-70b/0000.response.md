Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the function to find the maximum of two numbers using Python's built-in `max` function. This function will return the larger of the two inputs `a` and `b` for all potential cases, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. Since it handles all scenarios where two numbers are compared and returns the expected maximum, the implementation is correct.
