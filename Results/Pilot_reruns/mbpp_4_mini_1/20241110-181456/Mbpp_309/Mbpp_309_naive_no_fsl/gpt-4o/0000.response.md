Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The logic used in the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
2. It uses a conditional expression to return `a` if `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, it returns `b`.

The assertions included in the program test the function with various pairs of numbers:

- `func_1(5, 10)` correctly returns `10`, which is the maximum.
- `func_1(-1, -2)` correctly returns `-1`, which is the maximum among two negative numbers.
- `func_1(9, 7)` correctly returns `9`, which is the maximum.

I could not find any edge cases or inputs for which the function would fail to return the correct maximum value. The implementation handles both positive and negative integers correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
