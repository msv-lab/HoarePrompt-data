According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain at least one more character beyond what has been processed in the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the character that was just processed.

Since `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in `s` beyond the one currently being processed. The state of `char` must be adjusted to be the next character in the string `s` after the last processed character.

Thus, if `char` is currently the last character processed in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in `s`, and the length of `s` must be more than the current index of `char`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s`**
