According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return True. If `s` contains characters, the loop will execute, starting with the first character of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must contain at least one character, and `first_char` should be assigned the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
