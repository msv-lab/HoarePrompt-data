Postcondition: ***`s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. If `char` is equal to `first_char`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returning None).***
