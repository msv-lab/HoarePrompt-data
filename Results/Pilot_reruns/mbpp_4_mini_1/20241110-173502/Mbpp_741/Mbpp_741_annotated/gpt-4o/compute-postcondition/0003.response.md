According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must contain at least one character, and `first_char` should be assigned to the first character of `s`. At the start of the loop, `char` should be the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`**
