The function returns `False`, and the values of `s`, `first_char`, and `char` are unaffected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `s` contains at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` contains at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`, and the function returns False**
