Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks whether all characters in a string are the same or not. However, it does not handle the case of an empty string correctly based on the problem description. The assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` indicates that the function must return `False` when not all characters are the same, which is correct. The function correctly returns `True` for the string `'aaa'`, which consists of the same characters. However, the function returns `True` for an empty string, which is not specified in the problem description. 

A potential case where the function would not work as expected is:
- For an empty string `''`, the function returns `True`, but it is unclear if this behavior is desired based on the problem description. If the problem statement requires that the function should return `False` for an empty string (since there are no characters to be the same), then the implementation is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases.
