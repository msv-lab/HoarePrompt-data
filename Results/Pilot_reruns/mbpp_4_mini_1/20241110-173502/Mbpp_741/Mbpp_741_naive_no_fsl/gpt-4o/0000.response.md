Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check whether all characters in a string are the same. However, the assertions provided are incorrect based on the problem description.

1. The assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.
2. The assertion `assert func_1('aaa') == True` is correct since all characters are 'a'.
3. The assertion `assert func_1('data') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.

However, the program does not handle the case where the input string is an empty string correctly according to the problem description. According to the function logic, it returns `True` for an empty string, which implies that all characters are the same. Since the problem does not specify how to handle empty strings, this can be considered a case where the program's behavior might not align with expected definitions (some might argue that an empty string does not have characters at all).

Thus, since there is ambiguity regarding the treatment of an empty string and the program's handling of it may not align with all interpretations of the problem description, the program cannot be considered fully correct.
