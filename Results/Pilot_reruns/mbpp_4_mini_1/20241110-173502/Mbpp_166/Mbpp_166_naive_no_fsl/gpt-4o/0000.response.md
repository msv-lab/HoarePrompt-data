To determine the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used to count pairs of integers that result in an even XOR.

### Understanding XOR and Evenness:
1. XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or odd (i.e., both are even or both are odd).
2. The logic in the program counts:
   - The number of even integers and calculates the number of ways to choose 2 from them (even pairs).
   - The number of odd integers and calculates the number of ways to choose 2 from them (odd pairs).

### Analyzing the Code:
- The code correctly counts the number of even integers (`even_count`) and odd integers (`odd_count`).
- It then calculates the number of pairs of even integers using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
- It also calculates the number of pairs of odd integers using the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
- Finally, it sums the two results to return the total number of pairs whose XOR is even.

### Testing the Assertions:
- For the first assertion `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1])`, we have:
  - Even numbers: `[4, 2]` (2 even numbers)
  - Odd numbers: `[5, 7, 1]` (3 odd numbers)
  - Pairs of evens: 1 (since 2 choose 2 = 1)
  - Pairs of odds: 3 (since 3 choose 2 = 3)
  - Total pairs = 1 + 3 = 4. This assertion is correct.
  
- For the second assertion `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11])`:
  - Even numbers: `[2, 8, 0]` (3 even numbers)
  - Odd numbers: `[7, 1, 5, 11]` (4 odd numbers)
  - Pairs of evens: 3 (since 3 choose 2 = 3)
  - Pairs of odds: 6 (since 4 choose 2 = 6)
  - Total pairs = 3 + 6 = 9. This assertion is correct.
  
- For the third assertion `func_1([1, 2, 3])`:
  - Even numbers: `[2]` (1 even number)
  - Odd numbers: `[1, 3]` (2 odd numbers)
  - Pairs of evens: 0 (since 1 choose 2 = 0)
  - Pairs of odds: 1 (since 2 choose 2 = 1)
  - Total pairs = 0 + 1 = 1. This assertion is correct.

### Checking Edge Cases:
- An edge case would be an empty list `[]`, which should return 0 since there are no pairs:
  - `func_1([])` should return 0.
- Another edge case could be a list with a single element `[1]`, which should also return 0 since there cannot be any pairs:
  - `func_1([1])` should return 0.

### Conclusion:
The program works correctly for the provided assertions and handles additional edge cases as expected. 

Correctness: **True**
