The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is not specified, but it represents the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) that are either both even or both odd. The other variables, `i` and `j`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `count` by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `count` is incremented by 1**
