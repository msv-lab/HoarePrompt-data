Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd. If `nums` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute for all valid pairs; otherwise, if `nums` contains fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums)` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `count` is 0. If `len(nums)` is 2, the loop executes once, checking the only valid pair. The final value of `count` reflects the total pairs found among the elements in `nums`.**
