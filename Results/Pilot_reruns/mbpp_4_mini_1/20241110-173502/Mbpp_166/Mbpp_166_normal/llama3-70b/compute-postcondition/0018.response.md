The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 1 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `count` while showing the unchanged values of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
