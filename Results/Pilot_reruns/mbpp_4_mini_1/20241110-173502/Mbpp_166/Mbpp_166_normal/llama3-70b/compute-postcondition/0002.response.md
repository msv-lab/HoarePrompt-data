According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums` and the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `i + 1` to `len(nums)`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will start at index 1. For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration (if it were to execute), `count` is still 0 because the loop body is omitted. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `len(nums)` is greater than 1, `j` should start at 1 (which means `j` is the index of the second element in the list), and the current state of `count` remains unchanged.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
