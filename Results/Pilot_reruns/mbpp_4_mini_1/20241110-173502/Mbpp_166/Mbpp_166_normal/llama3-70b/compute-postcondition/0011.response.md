According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` set to `i + 1` and iterates until `j` is less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a list of integers containing at least 3 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `i + 2` for the next iteration.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't have any specific changes to other states like `count` or `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers containing at least 3 elements, j is `i + 2`**
