According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` contains at least 3 elements, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented to `i + 2` for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted because `count` does not affect the continuation of the loop, and there are no other relevant variables mentioned that need modification.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers containing at least 3 elements, `count` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`**
