The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers containing at least 3 elements, `count` is increased by 1, and `j` remains as `i + 2`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers containing at least 3 elements, `count` is increased by 1, and `j` is `i + 2**
