According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. For the loop to be executed, the `nums` list must have at least 1 integer, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 (the first index to be accessed).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
