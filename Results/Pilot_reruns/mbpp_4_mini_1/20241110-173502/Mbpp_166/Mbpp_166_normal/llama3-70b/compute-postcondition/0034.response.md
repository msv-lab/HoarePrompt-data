Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, increased by 1 if `nums[2]` and `nums[5]` are both even or both odd; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `len(nums)` is greater than 5, ensuring that the indices 2 and 5 are valid.***
