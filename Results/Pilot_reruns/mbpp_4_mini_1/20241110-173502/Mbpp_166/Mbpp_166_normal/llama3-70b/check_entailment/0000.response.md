To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the evaluation step by step.

**Problem description:** The function should count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the count of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If `nums` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return 0 since no pairs can be formed.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness**: The XOR of two numbers results in an even number if both numbers are either even or odd. This is consistent with the output hints which indicate that the program is counting pairs where both integers are of the same parity (either both even or both odd).
2. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle cases where:
   - The input list has fewer than 2 elements. The provided code does not explicitly handle this case; however, it will naturally return 0 since no pairs can be formed in such cases.
   - The list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
- The output hints correctly state that the function returns the count of pairs where both integers are either even or odd.
- It also mentions that if the list contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return 0, which aligns with the behavior of the code.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number, capturing all necessary cases as pointed out in the problem description and output hints.
- There are no identified edge cases that the program does not handle properly.

Thus, after considering both the code and the output hints, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number by checking if both integers are either even or odd. The handling of fewer than 2 elements is implicitly managed by returning 0 pairs, which adheres to the expected behavior.
