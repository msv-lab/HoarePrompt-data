The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it calculates `even_count`, which is the count of even integers in `lst`, and `odd_count`, which is the count of odd integers in `lst`. It then calculates `even_pairs` as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2` and `odd_pairs` as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. Finally, the function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the total number of pairs of even and odd integers in that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the total number of pairs of even and odd integers in the list.**
