The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - even_count`. The value of `len(lst)` is the total number of integers in the list `lst`, and `even_count` is the count of even integers in that list. Therefore, `odd_count` will represent the count of odd integers in `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst; odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst**
