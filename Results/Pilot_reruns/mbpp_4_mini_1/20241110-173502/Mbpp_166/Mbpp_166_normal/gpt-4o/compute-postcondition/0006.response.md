Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the number of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers in the list. It returns the total count of these pairs. Specifically, it computes the pairs of even integers using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2` and pairs of odd integers using `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, where `even_count` is the number of even integers and `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in the list. The function does not handle any edge cases such as an empty list explicitly, but it will return 0 in such cases since both `even_count` and `odd_count` will be 0.**
