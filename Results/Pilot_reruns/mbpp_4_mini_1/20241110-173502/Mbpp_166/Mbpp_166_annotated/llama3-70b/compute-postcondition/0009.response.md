The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `nums`, `j`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is increased by 1, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, and `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is increased by 1, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, and `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`**
