The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it represents the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`. The values of the other variables `i` and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is increased by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `len(nums) - 1**
