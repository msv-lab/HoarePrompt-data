The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. The function counts the number of pairs of elements in `nums` that have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd) and returns this count. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the number of pairs of elements that share the same parity. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers, and returns the count of pairs of elements in nums that have the same parity.**
