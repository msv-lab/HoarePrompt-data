Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and `j` is `len(nums) - 1`. If the elements at indices `i` and `j` have the same parity, `count` is increased by 1. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the operation does not affect `count`.***
