According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is less than `len(nums)` since the loop is still valid. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop starts from `i + 1`, and given that `i` is unchanged, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to be equal to `i + 1`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` should be incremented to `i + 2` in order for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, `nums` remains a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `count` will only be affected by the loop body, but its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`**
