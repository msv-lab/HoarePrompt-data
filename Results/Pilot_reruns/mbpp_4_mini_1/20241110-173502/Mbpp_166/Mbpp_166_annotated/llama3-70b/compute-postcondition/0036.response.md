Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2` (i.e., `nums[i]`). The loop will execute `len(nums) - 1 - i` times, where `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `len(nums) - 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `nums` contains fewer than 2 elements, the initial state is invalid as per the constraints given.**
