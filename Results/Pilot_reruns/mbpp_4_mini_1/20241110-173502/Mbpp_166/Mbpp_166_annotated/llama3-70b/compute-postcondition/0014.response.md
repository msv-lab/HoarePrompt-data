According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts iterating from `j = i + 1` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. Since `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, `j` would be initialized to `len(nums) + 1`, which is out of the bounds of the list. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(nums) - 1`, allowing `j` to start from a valid index. Hence, `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 1`, and `j` should be initialized to `len(nums)` (the starting point for the loop).

State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity, `len(nums)` is greater than 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`**
