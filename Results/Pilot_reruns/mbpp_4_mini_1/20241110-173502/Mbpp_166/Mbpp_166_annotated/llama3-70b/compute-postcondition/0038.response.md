Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` that have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements (i.e., `len(nums) < 2`), the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums) >= 2`, the loop executes `(len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1)) / 2` times in total across all iterations, counting valid pairs where the parity condition is satisfied. If `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, the inner loop will not execute as there are no valid `j` indices, and `count` remains unchanged.**
