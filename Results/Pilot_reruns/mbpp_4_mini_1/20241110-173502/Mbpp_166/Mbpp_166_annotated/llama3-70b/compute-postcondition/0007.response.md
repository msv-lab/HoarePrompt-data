Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` and `nums[len(nums)]` is even, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the XOR is odd, `count` remains unchanged. Note that `j` must be a valid index within the bounds of the list, which means `j` should be less than the length of `nums`.***
