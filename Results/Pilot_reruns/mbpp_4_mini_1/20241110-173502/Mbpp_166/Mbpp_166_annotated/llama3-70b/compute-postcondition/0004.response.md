Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1 if the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either even or odd. If they are of different parity (one is odd and the other is even), `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
