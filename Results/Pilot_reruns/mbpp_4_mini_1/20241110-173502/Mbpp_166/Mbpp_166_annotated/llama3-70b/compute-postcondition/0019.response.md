Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity. If the elements at indices `i` (which is `len(nums) - 1`) and `j` (which is `len(nums)`) have the same parity (i.e., their XOR is even), then `count` is increased by 1. If `j` is out of bounds (i.e., if `len(nums)` is not a valid index), the operation does not occur, and `count` remains unchanged.***
