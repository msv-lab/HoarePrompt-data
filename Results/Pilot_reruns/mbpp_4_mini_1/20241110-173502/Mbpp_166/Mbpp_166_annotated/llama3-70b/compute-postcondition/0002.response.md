According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute as long as `len(nums)` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `len(nums) - 1`. So for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and `j` starts at 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
