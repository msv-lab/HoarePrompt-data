The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is incremented regardless. The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is len(nums) - 1, `j` is len(nums).

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is len(nums) - 1, `j` is len(nums)**
