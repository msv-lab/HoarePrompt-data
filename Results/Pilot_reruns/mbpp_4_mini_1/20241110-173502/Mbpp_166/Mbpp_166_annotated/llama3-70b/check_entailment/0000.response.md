To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Annotations Summary:
1. The function iterates over pairs of elements in the list `nums`.
2. It counts a pair `(nums[i], nums[j])` if their XOR is even.
3. The function is stated to return the count of pairs with the same parity (both even or both odd).
4. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, it returns 0.

### Key Observations:
- The XOR of two integers is even if and only if both integers have the same parity (both even or both odd). This aligns with the statement in the annotations.
- The nested loops correctly iterate through all unique pairs of integers in the list.
- The provided logic correctly increments the count only when the condition for even XOR is met.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return 0, which it does.
2. **Single Element List**: `func_1([1])` should return 0, which it does.
3. **Two Elements with Different Parity**: `func_1([1, 2])` should return 0, which it does.
4. **Two Elements with Same Parity**: `func_1([2, 4])` should return 1, which it does.
5. **Multiple Elements**: For example, `func_1([1, 3, 5])` should return 3 (all pairs are odd), which it does. 

### Conclusion:
The function correctly counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number, aligning with the problem description. The annotations accurately summarize the behavior of the function, and no edge cases were identified where the function fails to meet the problem requirements.

Thus, after thorough analysis, I conclude that the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
