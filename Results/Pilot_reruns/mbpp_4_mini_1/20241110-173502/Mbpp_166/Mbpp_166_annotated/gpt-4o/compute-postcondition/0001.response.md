The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - even_count`. The `len(lst)` function calculates the total number of elements in the list `lst`, and `even_count` is subtracted from that total to determine the count of odd integers in the list. The values of `lst` and `even_count` influence the result, but since the specific values are not provided, we can only express the relationship between them.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`**
