The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is known, so we can calculate `even_pairs`. Other variables (`lst` and `odd_count`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2**
