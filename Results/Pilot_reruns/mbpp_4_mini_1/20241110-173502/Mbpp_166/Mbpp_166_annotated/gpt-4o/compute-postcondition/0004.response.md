The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. The values of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` are calculated based on the counts of even and odd integers in the list `lst`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables but provides the sum of those two calculated values.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is calculated based on `odd_count`, and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.**
