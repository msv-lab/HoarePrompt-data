The variable `odd_pairs` is assigned the value of `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The previous value of `odd_count` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `odd_pairs`. However, the calculation is dependent on the value of `odd_count`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, and `odd_pairs` is calculated based on `odd_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is calculated based on `odd_count`.**
