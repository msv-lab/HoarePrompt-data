The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the number of unique pairs that can be formed from even integers and odd integers in the list. It returns the total count of these pairs, which is the sum of even pairs and odd pairs. The function does not handle edge cases where `lst` is empty or contains fewer than two elements, which would result in counts being zero but is still valid according to the logic.
