The function returns `False`, and since `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` has a value of 2, the return statement does not change the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and the function returns False**
