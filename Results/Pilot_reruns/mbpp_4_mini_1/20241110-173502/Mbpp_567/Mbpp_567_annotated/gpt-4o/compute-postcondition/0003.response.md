According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `len(lst)` is at least 2, `len(lst) - 1` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to run again.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
