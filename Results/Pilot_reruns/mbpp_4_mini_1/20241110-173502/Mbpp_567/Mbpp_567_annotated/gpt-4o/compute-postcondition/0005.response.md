Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. If the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`, the function does not return anything (or implicitly returns None).***
