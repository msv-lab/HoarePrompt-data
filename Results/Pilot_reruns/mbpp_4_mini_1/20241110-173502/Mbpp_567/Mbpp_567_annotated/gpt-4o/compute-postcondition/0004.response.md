The function returns `False`, and `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` has a value of 1. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the function returns False**
