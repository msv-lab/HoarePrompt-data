The function returns the result of evaluating `all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))`, which checks if every element in `lst` is less than or equal to the next element. The value of `lst` is not specified, so the output state will indicate that the function returns a boolean value based on the comparison of elements in the list. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of comparable elements and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order**.
