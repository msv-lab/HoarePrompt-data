According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Given that `lst` has at least 3 elements, `len(lst)` is at least 3, which means `len(lst) - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
