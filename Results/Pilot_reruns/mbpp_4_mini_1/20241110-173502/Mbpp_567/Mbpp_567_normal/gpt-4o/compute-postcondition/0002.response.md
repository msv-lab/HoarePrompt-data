Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of elements with at least 1 element. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `lst` is greater than the second element (i.e., `lst[0] > lst[1]`), the function returns False. If `i` is 0 and `lst[0]` is less than or equal to `lst[1]`, the function does not return anything, implying that the condition is not met. Additionally, since `lst` has at least 2 elements, it is ensured that `lst[1]` exists and can be compared to `lst[0]`.***
