The function reaches a return statement that returns `True`. Since the initial state indicates that the loop has not executed (because `lst` has at least 2 elements), the state of `lst` and `i` remains unchanged. The return statement does not affect the values of `lst` or `i` but indicates that the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(lst) - 1`, and the function returns True**
