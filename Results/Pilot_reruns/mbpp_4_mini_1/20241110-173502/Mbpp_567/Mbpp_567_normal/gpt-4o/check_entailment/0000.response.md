To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. It should return:
- `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `False` if any adjacent elements are in decreasing order.
- If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it does not specify a return value, which implies the function would implicitly return `None`.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Output Hints:
The hints indicate that:
- The function returns `False` if any adjacent elements are in decreasing order.
- It returns `True` if all adjacent elements are in non-decreasing order.
- If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns `None`).

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through the list and checks if every adjacent pair is in non-decreasing order.
2. If it encounters a pair where the earlier element is greater than the later one, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- For lists with fewer than 2 elements, the function implicitly returns `None`. The problem description does not specify what to do in this situation, which could be considered a lack of handling according to specifications. Thus, it's ambiguous.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints generally agree with the code. They confirm that:
- The function does return `False` for adjacent elements in decreasing order.
- It does return `True` for non-decreasing order.
- The hint about lists with fewer than 2 elements being implicitly returned as `None` aligns with the code's behavior, but the lack of explicit handling for this case could be problematic.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not explicitly handle lists with fewer than 2 elements and the problem description does not clarify the expected behavior for such cases, it can lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions about the function's output. 

Thus, while the function behaves correctly in terms of checking order for lists with 2 or more elements, it does not meet the full requirements of the problem description due to its lack of clarity on handling shorter lists.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not specify an output for lists with fewer than 2 elements, which is not in line with a complete solution to the problem description.
