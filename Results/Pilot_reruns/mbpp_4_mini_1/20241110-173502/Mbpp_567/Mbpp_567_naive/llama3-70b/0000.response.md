Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to iterate through the list and check that each element is less than or equal to the next one. 

It handles various cases, including:
- An empty list, which is considered sorted.
- A single-element list, which is also considered sorted.
- Lists with duplicate elements, which are sorted by definition in non-decreasing order.
- Lists that are already sorted and those that are not.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, I conclude that it is correct.
