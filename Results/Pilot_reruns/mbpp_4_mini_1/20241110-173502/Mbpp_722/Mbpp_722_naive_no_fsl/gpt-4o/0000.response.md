Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary of students with their respective heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight requirements, and filters out students who do not meet these requirements.

The assertions provided test various scenarios:
1. The first assertion ensures that only students meeting both height and weight requirements are included in the result.
2. The second assertion tests with lower minimum values, confirming that it correctly includes students who meet the new criteria.
3. The third assertion tests even lower minimums, ensuring all students are included since they all exceed the given minimums.

In all tested cases, the output matches the expected results according to the requirements, and there are no edge cases or inputs that break the logic of the code. Thus, the program is correct and behaves as expected for all potential inputs based on the given problem description.
