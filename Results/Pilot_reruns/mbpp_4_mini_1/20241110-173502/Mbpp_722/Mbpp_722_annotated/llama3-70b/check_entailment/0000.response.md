To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
The function should filter students from a dictionary based on their height and weight. Specifically, it should return a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to a specified `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to a specified `min_weight`.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    # State of the program after the return statement: `student_data` is a dictionary of student names with their corresponding heights and weights, `min_height` and `min_weight` are the defined minimums, and the function returns a new dictionary containing only those students who meet or exceed the minimum height and weight criteria.
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input structure**: The input is a dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values. This is correctly handled in the code.
2. **Filtering logic**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension that checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to the specified minimums. This aligns with the problem description.
3. **Return value**: The function returns a new dictionary that contains only the students who meet the criteria. If no students meet the criteria, it returns an empty dictionary, which is also in accordance with the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- **Equal values**: The code checks for `>=`, meaning if a student's height or weight is exactly equal to the minimum, they will still be included in the result. This is consistent with the problem description.
- **Empty dictionary**: If `student_data` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary, which is valid.
- **Students below minimum**: If every student in the dictionary has a height or weight below the minimum specified, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is acceptable as per the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to handle all potential cases described in the problem statement correctly. The logic for filtering students based on height and weight is sound, and the annotations confirm that the code is behaving as expected. 

Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the filtering of students based on the provided height and weight criteria, adhering to the requirements set forth in the problem description.
