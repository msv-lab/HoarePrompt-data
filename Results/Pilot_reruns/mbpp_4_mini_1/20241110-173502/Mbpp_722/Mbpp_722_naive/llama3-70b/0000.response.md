Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters out students based on the specified minimum height and weight. It iterates through the dictionary of student data and checks if both the height and weight of each student meet or exceed the given minimum values. If both conditions are satisfied, the student is included in the returned dictionary. 

The program handles various cases, including:
- Students with heights and weights below the minimum thresholds.
- Students who meet the height requirement but not the weight requirement, and vice versa.
- Students who meet both requirements are correctly included in the result.

Since all potential edge cases related to the filtering logic are accounted for, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
