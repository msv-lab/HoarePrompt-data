The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

- `student_dict` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student name and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight, respectively. 
- `min_height` is a float value representing the minimum height threshold.
- `min_weight` is a float value representing the minimum weight threshold.

After executing the function body, it returns a filtered dictionary containing only the students who meet both the height and weight criteria based on the provided thresholds.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight thresholds, and returns a filtered dictionary of students who meet the height and weight criteria.**
