Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly checks for the presence of `None` values in the tuple. The problem description states that we need to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not, and the provided function returns `True` if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple. However, the expected functionality is to check if there are no `None` values and return a boolean indicating that.

Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

```python
# Input
tup = (1, 2, 3)  # This tuple has no None values

# Expected Output
# The expected output should be False since there are no None values.

# Actual output from the program
result = func_1(tup)  # This will return False, which indicates that the tuple has None values.
```

The function's logic is inverted based on the problem description. Hence, the function does not align with the requirement that asks to check for the existence of `None` values.
