Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. The function iterates over each item in the tuple.
2. If it finds an item that is `None`, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the tuple contains a `None` value.
3. If the loop completes without finding a `None`, it returns `False`, indicating that there are no `None` values in the tuple.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:
- `func_1((10, 4, 5, 6, None))` correctly returns `True`.
- `func_1((7, 8, 9, 11, 14))` correctly returns `False`.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, None))` correctly returns `True`.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the function operates correctly for all possible inputs as described.
