Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly checks for `None` values in the given tuple. It iterates through each item in the tuple and returns `True` if it finds any item that is `None`. If no `None` values are found, it returns `False`. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. All potential cases seem to be handled correctly, meaning the function adheres to the problem description.
