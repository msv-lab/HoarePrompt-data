Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if any element in the given tuple is `None`. The `any()` function iterates over the generator expression `(x is None for x in tup)`, which evaluates to `True` if at least one element in the tuple is `None`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
