The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain any type of elements, including None. 

- Case 1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element, the function checks each `item` in `tup`. If any `item` is None, the function returns True. If no `item` is None, the function does not return any value, and it is unspecified what happens next. 
- Case 2: If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element, and the function returns False. 

Additionally, if `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True if any element in the tuple is None. If no elements are None, the function does not return a value, and if the tuple is empty, it also does not return a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, and returns True if any item in tup is None. If no items are None, it does not return any value. If tup is empty, it does not return any value.**
