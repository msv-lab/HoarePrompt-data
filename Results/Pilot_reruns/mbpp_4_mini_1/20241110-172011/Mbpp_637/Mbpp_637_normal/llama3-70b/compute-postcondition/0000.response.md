The function returns the result of the comparison `cost_price == selling_price`. The values of `cost_price` and `selling_price` are not specified, so we can only state that the result of the comparison is a boolean value indicating whether the two prices are equal or not. The return statement does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`cost_price` and `selling_price` are numerical values, and the function returns a boolean indicating whether they are equal.**
