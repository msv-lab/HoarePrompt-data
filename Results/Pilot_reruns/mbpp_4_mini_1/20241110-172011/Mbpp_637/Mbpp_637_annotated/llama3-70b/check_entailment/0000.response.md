Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the given `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, which directly fulfills the requirement of determining if there is "no profit and no loss." The annotations clarify that the function compares the two numeric inputs and returns a boolean indicating their equality.

Since the only requirement is to check for equality between `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and the function correctly implements this logic without any missing edge cases or additional conditions, it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. The annotations confirm that the function is expected to return a boolean value based on the comparison, and there are no noted edge cases that the function fails to handle.

Overall, since there are no identified shortcomings in the program's logic or the annotations, the program is correct.
