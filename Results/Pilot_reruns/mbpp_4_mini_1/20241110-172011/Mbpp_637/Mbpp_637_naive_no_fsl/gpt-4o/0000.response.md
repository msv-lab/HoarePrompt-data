Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. According to the problem description, the function should determine if there is no profit and no loss, which is the case when the selling price equals the cost price.

The assertions provided in the program confirm the following scenarios:
- When the cost price is 1500 and the selling price is 1200, the function correctly returns `False`, indicating a loss.
- When both the cost price and selling price are 100, the function correctly returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss.
- When the cost price is 2000 and the selling price is 5000, the function correctly returns `False`, indicating a profit.

All possible edge cases have been considered, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. There are no cases where the function does not work as expected.
