Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, which indicates no profit and no loss. The assertions in the code confirm its correctness for the tested cases:

- `func_1(1500, 1200)` returns `False`, indicating a loss, which is correct.
- `func_1(100, 100)` returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss, which is correct.
- `func_1(2000, 5000)` returns `False`, indicating a profit, which is correct.

Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs that lead to incorrect results based on the problem description, the function adheres to the requirements for all possible scenarios.
