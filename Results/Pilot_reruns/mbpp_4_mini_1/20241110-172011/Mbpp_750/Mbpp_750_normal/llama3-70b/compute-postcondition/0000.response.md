The function returns the result of concatenating `lst` and `list(tup)`. The value of `lst` is a list, and `tup` is a tuple. The conversion of `tup` to a list does not change the state of `lst` or `tup`, but the return statement provides a new value. Therefore, the output state indicates that `lst` is a list, `tup` is a tuple, and the function returns the concatenated result of `lst` and `list(tup)`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tup` is a tuple, and the function returns `lst + list(tup)`**
