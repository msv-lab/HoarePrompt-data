The function returns the result of `lst + list(tpl)`. The variable `lst` is a list, and `tpl` is a tuple. The operation `list(tpl)` converts the tuple into a list, and then it concatenates this list with `lst`. The return statement does not change the state of `lst` or `tpl`, so the output state will reflect their original types and values as well as the value that is returned.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns `lst + list(tpl)`**
