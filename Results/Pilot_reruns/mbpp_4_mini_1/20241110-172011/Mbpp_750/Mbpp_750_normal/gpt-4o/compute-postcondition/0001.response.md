The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. The parameter `lst` is a list, and the parameter `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns the result of concatenating `lst` with the list created from `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that is the combination of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of lst and the elements of tpl.**
