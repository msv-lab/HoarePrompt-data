Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that results from concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. There are no checks for the types of `lst` or `tpl`, so if `lst` is not a list or `tpl` is not a tuple, the function may raise a TypeError.**
