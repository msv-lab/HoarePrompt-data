The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list, and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns the concatenation of `lst` and the list created from `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that is the result of concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tpl`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list) and tpl (a tuple), and returns a new list that is the concatenation of lst and the elements of tpl.**
