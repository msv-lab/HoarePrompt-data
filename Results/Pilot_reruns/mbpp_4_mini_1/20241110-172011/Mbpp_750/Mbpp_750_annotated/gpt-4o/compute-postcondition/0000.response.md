The function returns the concatenation of `lst` and the converted `tpl` into a list. The initial state indicates that `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple, but their specific contents are not provided. The return statement does not change the state of the initial variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the types and the result of the operation performed.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns lst + list(tpl)**
