The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`. If `tpl` is empty, it simply returns `lst`. The function does not handle any types other than list for `lst` and tuple for `tpl`, which could lead to a TypeError if incorrect types are provided.
