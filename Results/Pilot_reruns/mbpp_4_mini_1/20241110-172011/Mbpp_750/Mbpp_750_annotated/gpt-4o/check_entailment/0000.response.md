Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to concatenate a list and a tuple, returning a new list. However, there are several issues:

1. **Type Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the provided `lst` is not a list or `tpl` is not a tuple. The annotation mentions that if incorrect types are provided, it could lead to a `TypeError`. This means that if a user passes, for example, a string or a number instead of a list for `lst`, or a list instead of a tuple for `tpl`, the function will not execute as intended and will raise an error. This behavior is not aligned with the problem description, which implies that the function should simply concatenate the inputs without throwing an error for incorrect types.

2. **Edge Cases**: The annotations state that if `tpl` is empty, it simply returns `lst`. However, it does not specify what should happen if `lst` itself is empty or if either input is incorrectly typed. The function should ideally handle edge cases such as:
   - `func_1([], ())` should return `[]`.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - `func_1([], (4, 5))` should return `[4, 5]`.
   - If `lst` is a string or `tpl` is a list, the function should return an error message instead of throwing an exception.

Since the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
