Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the provided list correctly. The assertions provided in the program test various cases, and all of them evaluate to true. The function uses `list(tpl)` to convert the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the original list, which correctly meets the problem's requirement to add the tuple to the list. Since I cannot identify any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the code is correct.
