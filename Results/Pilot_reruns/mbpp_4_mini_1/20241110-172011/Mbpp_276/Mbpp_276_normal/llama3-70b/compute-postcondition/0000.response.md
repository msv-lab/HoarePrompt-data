The function returns the value of the expression `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state indicates that while the return value is calculated based on these variables, the state of `radius` and `height` remains unspecified. 

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative number, `height` is a non-negative number, and the function returns `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`**
