The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. The function returns the value of `math.pi * radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept non-negative numbers for `radius` and `height`, and return the product of `math.pi` and `radius`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both of which are non-negative numbers, and returns the value of math.pi multiplied by radius.**
