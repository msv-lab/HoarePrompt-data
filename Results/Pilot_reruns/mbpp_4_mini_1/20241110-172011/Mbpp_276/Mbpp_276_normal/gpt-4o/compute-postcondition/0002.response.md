The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. The function returns `volume`, which is calculated as `math.pi * radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the volume based on the provided radius. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both as non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume calculated as math.pi * radius.**
