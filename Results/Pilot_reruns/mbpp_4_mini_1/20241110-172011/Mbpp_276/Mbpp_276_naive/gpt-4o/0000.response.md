Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the radius or height is negative. The volume of a cylinder should not be calculated with negative values for radius or height, as these do not make physical sense. For instance:

- `func_1(-1, 5)` should not return a valid volume, but the current code would calculate a volume with a negative radius, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
