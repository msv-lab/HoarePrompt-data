To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider multiple scenarios, including edge cases.

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:

\[ V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

The provided program is:

```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

### Analysis:

1. **Imports**: The code uses `math.pi` but does not import the `math` module. This will result in a NameError when the function is called since `math` is not defined.

2. **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the inputs. If negative values are provided for radius or height, the formula will still compute a volume, but a cylinder cannot have negative dimensions. Hence, the function would not behave correctly in terms of physical meaning.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the radius or height is zero, the volume should also be zero, which the function correctly calculates. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the inputs are negative.
   - If the radius or height is a non-numeric type, the function will raise a TypeError, which is not handled.

Given these observations, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description due to missing imports and lack of input validation.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**.

The program does not import the `math` module, which will lead to an error when calling the function. Additionally, it fails to handle cases for negative values and non-numeric types correctly.
