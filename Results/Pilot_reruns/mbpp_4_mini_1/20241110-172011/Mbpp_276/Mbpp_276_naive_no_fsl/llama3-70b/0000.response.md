Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not include an import statement for the `math` module, which is necessary for the use of `math.pi`. Without this import, the function will raise a `NameError` when called, as `math` will not be defined. 

For example, if we call `func_1(2, 5)`, it will result in an error:

```python
func_1(2, 5)
```

This will raise `NameError: name 'math' is not defined`. Therefore, the function does not handle this potential case correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
