The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. The function calculates and returns the volume based on the formula involving `radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both non-negative numbers, and returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`.**
