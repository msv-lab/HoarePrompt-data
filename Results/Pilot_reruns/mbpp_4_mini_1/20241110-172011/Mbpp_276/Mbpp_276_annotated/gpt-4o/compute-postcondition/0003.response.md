Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. It returns this calculated volume. There are no checks for negative values or non-numeric input, which could lead to errors if such values are passed. **
