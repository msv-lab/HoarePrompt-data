The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, which means that `is_prime[8]` is set to `False`. The initial conditions indicate that `n` is greater than 6, and `is_prime[0]`, `is_prime[1]`, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, with `is_prime[4]` and `is_prime[6]` being False. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `is_prime[8]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
