According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to the upper limit defined by `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 4. Since `n` is also at least 9, the square root of `n` will be at least 3, making `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` at least 4. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 4.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. The states regarding `is_prime` remain unchanged since the loop body is not specified and we are focused only on the control variable `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, and `i` is 4**
