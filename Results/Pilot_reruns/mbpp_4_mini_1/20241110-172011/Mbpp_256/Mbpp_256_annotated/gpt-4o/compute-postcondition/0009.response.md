According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 6, with `n` being greater than 6. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated according to the expression `j = j + i` (where `i` is 2). This means that the next value of `j` will be 8 (6 + 2). However, since `n` is greater than 6, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` becomes 8. No other states need to be adjusted, as `i` remains 2 and `n` can still be greater than 6.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
