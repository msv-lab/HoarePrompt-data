To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i * i, n, i)`. This means the loop will iterate starting from `i * i`, going up to but not including `n`, with a step of `i`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 4.
   - `i` is 2, which means `i * i` equals 4.
   - `j` is 4.

3. The range for the loop is `range(4, n, 2)`. The starting point is 4, and the loop will continue executing until `j` reaches `n`, incrementing `j` by 2 each time.

4. Since `j` is currently 4 and the next value of `j` after the iteration would be 6 (because it increments by `i`, which is 2), we need to check whether `j` can be incremented again without exceeding `n`.

5. For the loop to execute again, the condition is that `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` will become 6, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 6.

6. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
   - `n` should be greater than 6 to allow the loop to execute one more time.
   - `i` remains 2, and `j` should be updated to 6 to reflect the next iteration's starting point.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
