According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` greater than or equal to 4, meaning that `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, and `j` is currently set to `i * i`. 

For the loop to execute at least one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `n`. Given that `j` is currently `i * i`, it must be adjusted to be less than `n`. 

We also know that `is_prime[j]` and `is_prime[j + i]` are both False, which indicates that these indices are not prime numbers. 

The next value of `j` would be `j + i`, so we need to ensure that `j + i` is still less than `n`. Thus, we need to adjust `j` to be `j + i` while making sure that `j + i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is updated to `j + i` and confirm that `j + i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j + i]` is False, `j` is updated to `j + i` and `j` is less than `n`**
