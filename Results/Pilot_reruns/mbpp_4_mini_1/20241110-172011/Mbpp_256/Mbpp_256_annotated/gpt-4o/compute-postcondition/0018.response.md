The assignment `is_prime[j] = False` updates the value of `is_prime` at index `j` to False. The previous state indicates that `is_prime[j + i]` is False, but we do not have specific values for `j` and `i`, only that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and that `is_prime[2:n]` are all True.

Since `is_prime[j]` is being set to False, it means that the number at index `j` is not prime. The specific values of other variables remain unchanged in this context.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j]` is False, and `is_prime[j + i]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j]` is False, and `is_prime[j + i]` is False.**
