The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, and since `j` is 6, we update `is_prime[6]` to `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_prime[2:n]` are all `True`, meaning all prime numbers up to `n` are marked as `True`. The only change occurs at index 6, which is now marked as `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
