According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 4. This means that the maximum value of `i` could be up to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the current state:
- If `i` was equal to `int(n ** 0.5)` in the last iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
- If `i` was less than `int(n ** 0.5)`, the loop can still execute again with the same value of `n`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that if `i` was equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than that.

Thus, we adjust `n` to ensure that it remains greater than or equal to 4 and increase `i` by 1 to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `i` is equal to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`**
