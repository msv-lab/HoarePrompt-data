According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop runs while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` has been updated to `j + i` and is still less than `n`. 

To determine if the loop will execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next value of `j` (which is `j + i`) is still less than `n`. Since `j` is currently less than `n` and has been updated to `j + i`, we need to ensure that `j + i` is also less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, we need to adjust the state so that it reflects the new value of `j` after the current iteration. 

Thus, the new conditions are:
- `j` needs to be updated to `j + i`, and we must ensure that `j + i < n`.

Since `j` is less than `n` and `i` is the step size, we can conclude that `j` should be updated to `j + i` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j]` is now False, `j` is updated to `j + i`, and `j` is less than `n`**
