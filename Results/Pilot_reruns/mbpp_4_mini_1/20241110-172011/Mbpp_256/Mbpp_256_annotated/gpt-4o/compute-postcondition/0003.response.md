The code assigns `False` to the first two elements of the list `is_prime`, which corresponds to the indices 0 and 1. The list `is_prime` was initially of size `n` with all elements set to `True`. Changing the values at indices 0 and 1 to `False` will affect those two specific elements, while the rest of the elements remain `True`. 

Therefore, if `n` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` becomes `False` and `is_prime[1]` becomes `False`. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all True**.
