According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from `i * i` to `n`, incrementing by `i` each time. For the loop to execute one more time, the starting value of `j` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is currently some value that is `i * i` and is less than `n`. However, since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can deduce that to allow for the loop to execute again, `j` must be adjusted to `j + i` while still being less than `n`.

Therefore, we can say that `j` has to be updated to reflect the increment of `i`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True; `is_prime[j + i]` is False**
