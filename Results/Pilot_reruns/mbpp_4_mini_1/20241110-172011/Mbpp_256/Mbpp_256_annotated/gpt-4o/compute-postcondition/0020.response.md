The statement `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the `is_prime` list. Since `j` is updated to `j + i` and is still less than `n`, this means that the specific index in `is_prime` corresponding to `j` is now marked as not prime. The previous values indicate that all indices from `2` to `n-1` were marked as `True`, except for `is_prime[j + i]`, which is `False`. 

After executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `is_prime[j]` is now `False`, indicating that the number at index `j` is not prime.
- Other values in `is_prime` remain unchanged, except for the specific index `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j]` is now False, and `j` is updated to `j + i` and remains less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `is_prime[j]` is now False, and `j` is updated to `j + i` and is less than `n`**.
