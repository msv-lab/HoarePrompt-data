According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop iterates starting from `i * i` and continues while `j` is less than `n`, incrementing by `i` each time. 

1. Given that `i` is 2, `i * i` equals 4.
2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, this means that the initial value of `j` (which is 4) is valid for entering the loop.
3. The loop will start with `j` equal to `i * i`, which is 4 in this case.

Since all conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute, particularly that `j` starts at 4 (which is less than or equal to `n`), the state does not need to be adjusted further regarding the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
