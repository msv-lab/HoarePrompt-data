Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is 2, it returns `True`. For any integer greater than 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. However, if `num` is odd and greater than 2 and not divisible by any integer up to its square root, the function will still return `True`, as there are no further checks defined after the loop. Thus, the function may not explicitly handle all potential cases for odd numbers greater than 2 in terms of return values if the conditions are not met.**
