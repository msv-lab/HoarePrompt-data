According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Given that `num` is 2 or greater, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. 

Since `num` is at least 2, we need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. If `num` is exactly 2, then `int(num ** 0.5)` would be 1, and the loop would not execute again. 

Therefore, `num` must be adjusted to be at least 9 (since `int(9 ** 0.5) + 1` equals 4, allowing `i` to be 3). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` is 9 or greater
- `i` is 3 (the next value in the range)

State: **`num` is 9 or greater, `i` is 3**
