According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `num`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the maximum value of `i`, which is `int(num ** 0.5)`. Given that `num` is at least 9, `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 3 (specifically, it would be 3 if `num` is exactly 9). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4. This requires `num` to be at least 16 (since `int(16 ** 0.5)` equals 4).

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly: `num` must be at least 16, `i` should be 4.

State: **`num` is 16 or greater, `i` is 4**
