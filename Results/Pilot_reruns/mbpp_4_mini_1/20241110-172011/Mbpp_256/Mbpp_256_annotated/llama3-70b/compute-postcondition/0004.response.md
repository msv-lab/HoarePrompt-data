Postcondition: ***`num` is 2 or greater and `i` is 2. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. In this case, the only edge case is when `num` equals 2, which is the smallest prime number, and the function would return False. If `num` is odd or greater than 2 and not divisible by `i`, the function would not return anything.***
