Output State: **If `num` is 2, the loop does not execute, and the function may complete without returning a value. If `num` is greater than 2, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is odd and greater than 2 and not divisible by any `i` up to the square root of `num`, the loop completes without returning a value, indicating `num` may be a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False immediately.**
