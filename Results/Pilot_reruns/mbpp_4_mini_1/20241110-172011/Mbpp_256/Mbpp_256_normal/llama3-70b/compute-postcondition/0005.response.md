According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition specified in the `range` function. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is 2 or greater. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to determine if `i` can execute again. The loop will execute again if `i` is still within the range defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

1. If `num` is equal to 2, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 1, and the range would be from 2 to 2 (exclusive of 2). Thus, the loop would not execute again.
2. If `num` is greater than 2, then `int(num ** 0.5)` would be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute again.

In both cases, since `num` is 2 or greater, we need to adjust `i` to 3 to check for the next value in the next iteration. However, we also need to ensure that `num` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3 so that `int(num ** 0.5)` remains at least 1, allowing `i` to be less than or equal to it.

State: **`num` is 3 or greater, `i` is 3**
