Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns False. If `num` is 2, the loop executes once with `i` equal to 2, and since 2 is prime, the function does not return any value. If `num` is greater than 2 and the loop executes, it checks divisibility of `num` by values of `i` starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any `i` within the given range, the function does not return any value, meaning its behavior remains undefined. Thus, `num` is still at least 2, and `i` could be any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`.**
