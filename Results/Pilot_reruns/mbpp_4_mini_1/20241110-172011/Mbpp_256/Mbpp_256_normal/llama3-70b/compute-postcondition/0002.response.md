According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is at least 2, since the range for `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `num` is 2 or greater. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` which will be 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
