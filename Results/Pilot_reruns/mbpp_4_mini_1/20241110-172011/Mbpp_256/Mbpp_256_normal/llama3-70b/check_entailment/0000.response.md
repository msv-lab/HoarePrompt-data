Let's analyze the provided code and its description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that takes a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

### Function Analysis:

**Function 1: `func_1(n: int) -> int`**
```python
def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return count
```
- The function iterates over numbers from 2 to `n-1` and counts how many of those are prime.
- If `n` is exactly 2, the function will return 0, which is correct since there are no primes less than 2.
- If `n` is less than 2, the behavior is not explicitly defined since the loop will not execute, and it will return 0, which is also logically correct since there are no primes less than 2.

**Function 2: `is_prime(num: int) -> bool`**
```python
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- The function correctly identifies if a number is prime. 
- It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, `True` for 2, and checks divisibility for numbers greater than 2.
- However, if none of the conditions for returning `True` or `False` are met during the loop (which won't happen here since we have a return statement at the end), it implicitly returns `None`, but this situation does not apply as the logic is sound.

### Output Descriptions:
1. **Output description for Function 1:** 
   - The description correctly mentions that the function returns the count of prime numbers less than `n` and clearly states the behavior for `n = 2` and `n < 2`.
   
2. **Output description for Function 2:**
   - The behavior described matches the code and correctly explains how the function determines primality.

### Edge Cases:
- The function `func_1` handles `n < 2` by returning 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers below 2.
- The function `is_prime` correctly handles all cases of primality.

### Final Assessment:
Both functions work as intended and adhere to the problem description for all potential cases. The output descriptions align well with the code.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
