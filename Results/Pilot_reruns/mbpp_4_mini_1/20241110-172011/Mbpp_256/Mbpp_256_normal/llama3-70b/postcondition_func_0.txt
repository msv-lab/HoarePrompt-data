The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where `n` is greater than or equal to 2) and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than `n`. If `n` is exactly 2, the function will return 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 2. If `n` is less than 2, the function's behavior is undefined based on the annotations, but as per the code, it will not count any primes since the loop will not execute. Therefore, the function only correctly handles cases where `n` is 2 or greater.
