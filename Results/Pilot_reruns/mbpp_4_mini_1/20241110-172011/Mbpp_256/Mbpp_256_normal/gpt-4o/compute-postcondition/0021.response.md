According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` after the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, which means `j` (equal to `i * i + i`) is less than or equal to `n`.
- `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `j` is equal to `i * i + i`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the sequence, which is `j + i`. Therefore, we will update `j` to be `i * i + 2 * i` (the next value after `i * i + i`), and we also need to ensure that `n` is still greater than this updated value of `j`:

- The new value of `j` will be `i * i + 2 * i`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `i * i + 2 * i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + 2 * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `j` is equal to `i * i + 2 * i`**
