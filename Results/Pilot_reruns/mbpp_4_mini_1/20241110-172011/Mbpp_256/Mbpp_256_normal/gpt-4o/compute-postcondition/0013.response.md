Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False. If `n` is greater than 2 and `is_prime[i]` is True, then for each `j` from `i * i` to `n`, all multiples of `i` in `is_prime` will be set to False, including all even indices up to `n`. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
