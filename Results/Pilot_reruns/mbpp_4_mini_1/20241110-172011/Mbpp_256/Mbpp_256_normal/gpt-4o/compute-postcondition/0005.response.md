According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will begin execution if `i * i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 2, we can calculate `i * i` as 4. 

For the loop to execute:
1. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i * i`, which means `n` must be greater than 4.
2. The loop variable `j` will start from `i * i`, which is 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 4, and
- `j` is initialized to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values set to True, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
