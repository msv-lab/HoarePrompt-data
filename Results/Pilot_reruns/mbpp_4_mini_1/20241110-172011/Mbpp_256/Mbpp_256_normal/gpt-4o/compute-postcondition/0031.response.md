According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i * i + 2i`, and `n` is greater than `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`.

Thus, we need to adjust `j` to `i * i + 2i + i` (which simplifies to `i * i + 3i`) and keep `n` the same since it is still greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + 3i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + 3i`**
