According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 8
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 8

To determine the next value of `j` for the next iteration, we calculate `j` based on the loop statement, which states that `j` will take on the value `i * i`, and then increment by `i` for each iteration. 

The next value of `j` would be `j + i`, which is `8 + 2 = 10`. 

Since `n` is greater than 8, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we can adjust the state to reflect that `j` will be 10, and since `n` is greater than 8, we need to ensure that it is also greater than 10 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `is_prime[8]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 10**
