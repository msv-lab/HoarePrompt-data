The code initializes `is_prime` as a list of boolean values, all set to `True`, with a length of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` will be created accordingly. If `n` is 0, `is_prime` will be an empty list. If `n` is 1, `is_prime` will also be an empty list. If `n` is 2, `is_prime` will be a list with one element set to `True`. If `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` will be a list of `n` elements, all set to `True`.

The previous state of `n` does not change, and the return behavior is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values set to True**
