According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, and `i` is 2. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is 4 + 2 = 6. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than 4, we can conclude that `j` will be 6, and we must ensure that `n` is greater than 6 for the loop to iterate one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
