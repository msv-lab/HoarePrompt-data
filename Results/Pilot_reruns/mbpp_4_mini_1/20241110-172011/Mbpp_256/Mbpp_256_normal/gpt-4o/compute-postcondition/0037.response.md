The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return anything (implying no specific value is returned). Additionally, the function also involves a parameter `is_prime`, which has `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, and the function returns the sum of the values in `is_prime`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and return nothing if `n` is greater than 2. In the case where `is_prime` is involved, it returns the sum of its values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it does not return anything. Additionally, it can return the sum of values in `is_prime` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to False.**
