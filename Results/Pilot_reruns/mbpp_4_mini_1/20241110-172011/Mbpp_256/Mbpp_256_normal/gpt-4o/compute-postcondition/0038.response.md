Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, it calculates and returns the count of prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Specifically, it initializes a boolean list indicating potential prime numbers, marks 0 and 1 as non-prime, and sums the boolean values corresponding to the prime indices, effectively counting the primes. **
