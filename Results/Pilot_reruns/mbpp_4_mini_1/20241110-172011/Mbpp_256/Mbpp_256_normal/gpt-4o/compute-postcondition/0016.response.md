The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False` for some index `j`. The current state of `is_prime` indicates that `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are already `False`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, there is at least one more index in the list. The index `j` is not specified, but we can infer that it is within the bounds of `is_prime`.

Since the value of `j` is not given, we cannot determine the exact position in the `is_prime` list that is being set to `False`. However, we can conclude that one of the values in the list `is_prime` (specifically the value at index `j`) is now `False`. The other values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `is_prime[j]` has been set to `False`, while the rest of the list remains as previously defined.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n))**
