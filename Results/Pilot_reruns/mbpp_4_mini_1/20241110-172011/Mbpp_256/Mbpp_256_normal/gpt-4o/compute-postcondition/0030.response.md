The code `is_prime[j] = False` updates the value of `is_prime` at the index `j`, which is calculated as `i * i + 2i`. The variable `is_prime` is modified such that `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. The value of `n` being greater than `i * i + 2i` indicates that the operation is valid within the bounds of the array `is_prime`. Other variables, such as `i` and `j`, retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + 2i; `is_prime[j]` is set to False; `i` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `i * i + 2i**
