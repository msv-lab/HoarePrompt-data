Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to i * i, then is_prime[j] is set to False for all multiples of i starting from i * i up to but not including n. After the loop executes k times, j is i * i + k * i, where k is the number of times the loop has executed. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute and is_prime remains unchanged, with is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] set to False.**
