The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`. Given that `j` is equal to `i * i`, and since `n` is greater than `i * i`, the variable `is_prime` at index `j` is being set to `False`. The previous values of `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are already set to `False`, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `is_prime` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i`**
