Output State: **`is_prime` remains unchanged for indices less than `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for some indices `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` in increments of `i`, where `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
