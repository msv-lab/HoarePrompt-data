Output State: **If n is at least 2, `is_prime` will have `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, and for each prime `i` in the range from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5)`, all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n` will have `is_prime[j]` set to False. If n is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False. If n is 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If n is greater than or equal to 2 and `is_prime[i]` is True, all indices greater than or equal to `i * i` will be updated based on the multiples of `i`. If `i` exceeds `int(n ** 0.5)`, the loop will terminate without further changes to `is_prime`.**
