The statement `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. Since `j` is 4, the element at index 4 of `is_prime` is set to `False`. The previous values of the relevant variables are:
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, with all initially set to `True`, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, which are `False`.
- The value of `j` is 4.

Thus, the state of `is_prime` changes only at index 4, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `is_prime[4]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
