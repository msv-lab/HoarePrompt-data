The function returns `0`, and `n` has a value that is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. The return statement does not change the state of `n`, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0, and the function returns 0**
