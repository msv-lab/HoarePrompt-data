According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop executes for `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with increments of `i`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute:
1. The starting value `i * i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is at least 2, `i * i` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i * i`. This means that `n` must be at least 4 if `i` is 2.
2. The value of `j` will begin at `i * i` and increment by `i` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

So, for the loop to execute, we need:
- `n` must be greater than `i * i`.
- The initial value of `j` should be set to `i * i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i`**
