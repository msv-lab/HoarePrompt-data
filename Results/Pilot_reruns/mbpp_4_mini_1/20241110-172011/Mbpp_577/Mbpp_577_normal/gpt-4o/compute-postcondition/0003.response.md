The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns `0`. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `0` if `n` is 5 or greater, or the last digit of the factorial of `n` if `n` is less than 5. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns `0` if `n` is greater than or equal to 5; if `n` is less than 5, it returns the last digit of the factorial of `n`.**
