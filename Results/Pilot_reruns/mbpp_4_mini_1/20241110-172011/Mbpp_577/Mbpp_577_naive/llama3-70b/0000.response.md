Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial for all possible inputs. For example, for `n = 5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program will return `0`, which is not a valid last digit of the factorial for `n = 5`, as the logic does not account for values greater than `4` correctly. The program only returns `0` for all inputs greater than `4`, which is incorrect. Additionally, for `n = 1`, the factorial is `1! = 1`, so it should return `1`, but the program would return `1` correctly, though it misses the correct handling for larger numbers. Thus, the logic is flawed and does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
