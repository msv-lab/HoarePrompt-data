To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description ("Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number."), we need to analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Code Analysis
The function `func_1(n)` is structured to handle several cases based on the value of `n`:

1. If `n < 2`, it returns `n`. (This means it returns 0 for `n = 0` and 1 for `n = 1`.)
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `n`.
3. If `n` is 4, it returns 4.
4. For all other non-negative integers (i.e., `n >= 5`), it returns 0.

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations describe the behavior of the function clearly:
- For `n = 0`: returns 0
- For `n = 1`: returns 1
- For `n = 2`: returns 2
- For `n = 3`: returns 3
- For `n = 4`: returns 4
- For `n >= 5`: returns 0

### Problem Description vs. Program Logic
The problem requires us to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. Let's evaluate the last digit of the factorial for various values of `n`:

- **0! = 1** → Last digit is 1.
- **1! = 1** → Last digit is 1.
- **2! = 2** → Last digit is 2.
- **3! = 6** → Last digit is 6.
- **4! = 24** → Last digit is 4.
- **5! = 120** → Last digit is 0.
- **6! = 720** → Last digit is 0.
- **7! = 5040** → Last digit is 0.
- **8! = 40320** → Last digit is 0.
- **9! = 362880** → Last digit is 0.
- **10! = 3628800** → Last digit is 0.

### Conclusion
The function does not return the correct last digit of the factorial for all values of `n`. Specifically:
- For `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the program incorrectly returns 0 and 1 respectively, while it should return 1 for both cases (the last digit of their factorial).
- For `n = 5` and beyond, the program returns 0, which is correct for the last digit of their factorials, but it fails to reflect this in its earlier logic.

By examining the program logic against the factorial results, it is clear that there are several discrepancies, particularly for the cases where `n` is less than 5.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
