Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). This includes returning 1 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, 2 for `n = 2`, 6 for `n = 3`, and 4 for `n = 4`.**
