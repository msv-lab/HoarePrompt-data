Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function computes the factorial of `n`, initializes `factorial` to 1, and returns the last digit of the computed factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). This includes cases where `n` is 0 (returning 1) and where `n` takes values from 1 to 4 (returning the last digit of the respective factorial values).***
