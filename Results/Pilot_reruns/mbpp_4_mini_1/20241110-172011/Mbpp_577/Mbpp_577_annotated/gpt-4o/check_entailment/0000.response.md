Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1(n)` does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. 

Here are the key points that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Behavior for n >= 5**: The function returns `0` for any input `n` that is greater than or equal to `5`. This is incorrect because the last digit of the factorial for numbers greater than or equal to `5` is not `0`. For instance:
   - For `n = 5`, the factorial is `120`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 6`, the factorial is `720`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 7`, the factorial is `5040`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 8`, the factorial is `40320`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 9`, the factorial is `362880`, and the last digit is `0`.
   However, the function should return `0` for these cases correctly but it fails to recognize that for inputs like `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`, the output should still be `0`.

2. **Behavior for n < 5**: The function computes the last digit of the factorial correctly for `n = 0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. Specifically, it returns:
   - For `n = 0`, returns `1` (correct).
   - For `n = 1`, returns `1` (correct).
   - For `n = 2`, returns `2` (correct).
   - For `n = 3`, returns `6` (correct).
   - For `n = 4`, returns `4` (correct).
   
   However, since the function doesn't handle the case where `n >= 5` correctly, it fails the overall requirement.

3. **Annotations**: The annotations incorrectly state that the function should return `0` for `n >= 5` without acknowledging that it should return a valid last digit, which should not be `0` but rather the last digit of the factorial of `n`. 

Thus, since the function does not handle the case for `n >= 5` properly, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the function is indeed **False**.
