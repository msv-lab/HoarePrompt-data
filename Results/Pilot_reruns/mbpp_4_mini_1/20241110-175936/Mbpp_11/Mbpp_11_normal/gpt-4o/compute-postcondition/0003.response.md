Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. If either `first_index` or `last_index` is -1, or if `first_index` equals `last_index`, the function returns `s` unchanged.***
