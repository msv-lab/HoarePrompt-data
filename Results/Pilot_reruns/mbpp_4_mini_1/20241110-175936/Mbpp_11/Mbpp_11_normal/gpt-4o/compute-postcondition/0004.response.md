To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the conditions and the slicing operation involved.

1. **Understanding the Code**: 
   - The code attempts to return a new string formed by removing the first occurrence of the character `ch` from the string `s`, but only if certain conditions are met.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The function returns `s` unchanged if:
     - `first_index` is -1 (meaning `ch` is not found in `s`)
     - `last_index` is -1 (meaning `ch` is not found in `s`)
     - `first_index` equals `last_index` (meaning there's only one occurrence of `ch`)

3. **Output State**:
   - The impact of the code is conditional based on the values of `first_index` and `last_index`.
   - If either `first_index` or `last_index` is -1, or if they are equal, `s` remains unchanged.
   - If none of these conditions are true, the returned string will be a modification of `s` with the first occurrence of `ch` removed.

Since the conditions for returning `s` unchanged have been outlined but no specific values for `first_index` and `last_index` are given, we conclude based on the general conditions.

Output State: **`s` is unchanged since either `first_index` or `last_index` is -1, or `first_index` equals `last_index`.**
