The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. After executing the function body, it checks the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. 

- Case 1: If either the first or last index of `ch` in `s` is -1, or if the first index equals the last index, the function returns `s` unchanged.
- Case 2: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function also returns `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return the string `s` unchanged based on the conditions related to the occurrences of `ch` within `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns `s` unchanged if either the first or last occurrence of `ch` in `s` is not found, or if both occurrences are the same.**
