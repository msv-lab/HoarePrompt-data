Let's analyze the provided Python program and its correctness based on the problem description.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]

assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns `s` unchanged if `ch` does not occur in `s` or if it occurs only once. If `ch` occurs at least twice in `s`, it removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` and returns the modified string.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `ch`.
2. If `ch` is not found or occurs only once (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), the function returns the original string `s`.
3. If `ch` occurs at least twice, the function constructs a new string with the first occurrence and last occurrence of `ch` removed.

### Edge Cases:
- If the string `s` is empty (`""`), the function should return `""` since there are no characters to remove.
- If `ch` is the only character in `s` (e.g., `s = "a"` and `ch = "a"`), the function should return an empty string, but it currently returns `s`.
- If `ch` occurs multiple times but is also the first and last character (e.g., `s = "aaa"` and `ch = "a"`), it should return an empty string, but it currently returns `""` which is correct. However, the handling of cases where all characters are `ch` needs clarity.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints accurately describe what the function is supposed to do. They mention:
1. It returns unchanged `s` if `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once.
2. It removes the first and last occurrences if `ch` occurs at least twice.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the case where `s` is empty and does not correctly handle the case where `s` consists solely of `ch`. 

Based on the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases, specifically:
- It does not return an empty string when `s` consists solely of `ch`.

Correctness: **False**.
