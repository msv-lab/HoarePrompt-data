The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `c` is a single character. The function calculates the index of the first occurrence (`first_occ`) and the last occurrence (`last_occ`) of `c` in `s`. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1 (indicating that `c` is found in `s`), the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, meaning `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `c`, and return a modified version of `s` by removing the first and last occurrences of `c` if found, or the original string `s` if `c` is not present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`, returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found in `s`. If `c` is not found, it returns `s` unchanged.**
