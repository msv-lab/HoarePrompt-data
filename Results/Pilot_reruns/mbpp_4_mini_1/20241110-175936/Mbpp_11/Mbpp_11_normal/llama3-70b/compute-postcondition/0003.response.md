The function returns `s`, which is a string. The return statement does not change the state of any other variables (`c`, `first_occ`, and `last_occ`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the return value.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, and the function returns `s`.**
