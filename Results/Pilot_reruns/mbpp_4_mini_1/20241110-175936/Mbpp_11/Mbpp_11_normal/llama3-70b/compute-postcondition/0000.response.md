The value of `first_occ` is assigned the result of `s.find(c)`, which returns the lowest index of the substring `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will hold the index of its first occurrence; if `c` is not found, it will return -1. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string; `c` is a single character; `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `c` is a single character; `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found**
