The return statement constructs a new string by concatenating three parts of `s`. The first part is `s[:first_occ]`, which includes all characters from the start of `s` up to, but not including, the character at index `first_occ`. The second part is `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]`, which includes all characters between the first occurrence and the last occurrence of `c`, excluding both. The third part is `s[last_occ + 1:]`, which includes all characters after the last occurrence of `c`. 

If `first_occ` is -1, the first part would be an empty string. If `last_occ` is -1, the second part would also be an empty string, resulting in a return of the string up to `first_occ` and everything after. 

The output state depends on the values of `first_occ` and `last_occ`:
- If `c` is found in `s`, both indices will be valid (>= 0).
- If `c` is not found, both indices will be -1.

Thus, the output state reflects the construction of the new string based on the positions of `c`.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `c` is a single character; `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found; `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found; the function returns the modified string.**
