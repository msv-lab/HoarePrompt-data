To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code and its functionality step by step.

### Problem Description
The goal is to create a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character `c` from a string `s`. If the character is not found in the string, it should return the string unchanged. If the character appears only once, that occurrence should be removed.

### Program Analysis
The program is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(s, c):
    first_occ = s.find(c)
    last_occ = s.rfind(c)
    if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1:
        return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

1. The program uses `s.find(c)` to find the index of the first occurrence of `c` and `s.rfind(c)` for the last occurrence.
2. If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1), it constructs a new string by skipping the first and last occurrences.
3. If either occurrence is not found, the function returns the original string `s`.

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Character Not Present**: If `c` is not in `s`, the function correctly returns `s` unchanged.
2. **Character Appears Once**: If `c` appears only once in `s`, `first_occ` and `last_occ` will be the same. The function will then return the string without that occurrence, which is correct.
3. **Multiple Occurrences**: The function correctly identifies and removes the first and last occurrences when `c` appears multiple times.

### Output Hints
The output hints specify that the function removes the first and last occurrences of `c` from `s`, returning the unchanged string if `c` is absent or if it effectively removes the character entirely if it appears only once.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description and handles all outlined cases correctly. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the description.

Given that no counterexamples or discrepancies have been found:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the required functionality for all potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
