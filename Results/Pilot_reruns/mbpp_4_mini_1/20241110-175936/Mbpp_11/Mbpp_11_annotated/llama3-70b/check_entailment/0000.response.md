To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations provided.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, c):
    first_occ = s.find(c)
    # `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` or -1 if not found
    last_occ = s.rfind(c)
    # `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` or -1 if not found
    
    if (first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1):
        return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]
        # Removes the first occurrence at `first_occ` and the last occurrence at `last_occ`
    else:
        return s
        # If `c` is not found, return the original string
```

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Character Not Present**: If `c` is not in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. This aligns with the requirements.
2. **Character Present Once**: If `c` occurs only once, `first_occ` and `last_occ` will be the same, and the result will exclude that occurrence. This also meets the requirements.
3. **Character Present Multiple Times**: The function correctly identifies the first and last occurrences and constructs a new string without those characters.

### Annotations Review:
- The annotations describe the states correctly and accurately represent what the code does.
- They clarify that if both occurrences are found, the function constructs a new string excluding both indices. 
- They also state that if either occurrence is not found, the original string is returned.

### Potential Cases:
- Test Case 1: `func_1("hello", "l")` should return "hel".
- Test Case 2: `func_1("hello", "x")` should return "hello" (character not present).
- Test Case 3: `func_1("lollipop", "l")` should return "ollipop" (removes first 'l' at index 0 and last 'l' at index 5).

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
The code handles edge cases appropriately:
- If `c` is absent, it returns the original string.
- If `c` exists only once, it returns the string without that character.
- If `c` appears multiple times, it removes the first and last occurrences properly.

### Conclusion:
The code matches the problem description in all potential cases and adheres to the requirements as described. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code fails to perform as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
