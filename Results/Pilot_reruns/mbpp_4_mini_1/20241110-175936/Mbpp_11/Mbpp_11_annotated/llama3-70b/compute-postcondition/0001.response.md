The `last_occ` variable is assigned the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which returns the highest index of the substring `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is not found in `s`, it returns -1. The previous values of `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `last_occ` will hold a specific value based on whether `c` is present in `s` or not. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either an index of `c` in `s` or -1, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not present.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either an index of `c` in `s` or -1, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not present**
