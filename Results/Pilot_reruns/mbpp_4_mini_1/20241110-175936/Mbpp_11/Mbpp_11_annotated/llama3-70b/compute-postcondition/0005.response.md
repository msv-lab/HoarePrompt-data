The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`. The function identifies the indices of the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`, denoted as `first_occ` and `last_occ`, respectively, where `first_occ` can be an index or -1 if `c` is not found, and `last_occ` can also be an index or -1 if `c` is not found. 

The functionality of the function is as follows:

- **Case 1:** If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1 (meaning `c` is present in `s`), the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed.
- **Case 2:** If either `first_occ` is -1 or `last_occ` is -1 (meaning `c` is not present in `s`), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is present in `s`; otherwise, it returns the original string `s` unchanged.**
