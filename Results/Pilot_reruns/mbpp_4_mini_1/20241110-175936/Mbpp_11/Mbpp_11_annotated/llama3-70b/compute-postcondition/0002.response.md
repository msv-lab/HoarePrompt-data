The return statement constructs a new string by concatenating three parts of `s`: 

1. `s[:first_occ]` - This extracts the substring from the start of `s` up to (but not including) the first occurrence index of `c`. 
2. `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]` - This extracts the substring from the character immediately after the first occurrence of `c` to the character just before the last occurrence of `c`.
3. `s[last_occ + 1:]` - This extracts the substring from the character immediately after the last occurrence of `c` to the end of the string.

If `first_occ` is -1 (meaning `c` is not found in `s`), `s[:first_occ]` would result in an empty string. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are -1, then the entire string `s` would be returned as is.

The output state will depend on the values of `first_occ` and `last_occ`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either an index of `c` in `s` or -1, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not present; the function returns the modified string based on the occurrences of `c`.**
