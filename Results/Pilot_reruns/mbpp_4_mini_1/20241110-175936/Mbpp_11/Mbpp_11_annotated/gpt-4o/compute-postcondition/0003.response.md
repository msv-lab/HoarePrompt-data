Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, and `last_index` is the last index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. If `first_index` is -1, `last_index` is -1, or both indices are equal, the function returns `s` without any changes, which occurs when `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once.***
