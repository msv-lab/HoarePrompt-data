Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the second list (`list2`) contains a zero. If `list2` has a zero at any position, the division by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. For example, if we call `func_1([4, 5, 6], [1, 0, 3])`, it will result in an error because of the division by zero in the second element. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of handling all potential cases, specifically when the divisor is zero.
