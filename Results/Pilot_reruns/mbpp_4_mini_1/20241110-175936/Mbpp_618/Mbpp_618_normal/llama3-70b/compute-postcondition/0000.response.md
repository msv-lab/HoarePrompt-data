The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. This indicates that there has been a check that failed regarding the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, but since no other variable states are modified or affected by this action, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the lists and the raised exception.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and have the same length, and a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'**
