Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same length. If the lists are of unequal length, a ValueError is raised. If they are of equal length, the function returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, a ZeroDivisionError will occur during the division operation. Therefore, the function does not handle the case where division by zero is attempted. **
