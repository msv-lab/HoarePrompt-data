To assess the correctness of the given Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to divide two lists element-wise.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [a / b for (a, b) in zip(list1, list2)]
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length, and returns a list of the results of dividing corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur, which is not handled in the code.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality:** The program performs element-wise division of two lists using a list comprehension and the `zip` function, which pairs the elements from both lists together.
2. **Zero Division:** The program does not handle the case where any element in `list2` is zero. If `list2` contains a zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised, which means the function does not fulfill its requirement to handle all potential input cases as specified in the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- If `list2` contains a zero, the program will not work correctly as it will raise an exception instead of returning a valid result. For example:
  ```python
  func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 0, 3])  # This will raise ZeroDivisionError
  ```

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints clearly state that the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if any element in `list2` is zero, confirming our initial assessment that the program does not handle this edge case.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically when `list2` contains zero), we conclude that the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle division by zero, which means it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential inputs.
