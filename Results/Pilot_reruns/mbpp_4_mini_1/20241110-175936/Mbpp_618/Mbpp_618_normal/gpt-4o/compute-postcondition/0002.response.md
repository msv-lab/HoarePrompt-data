Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length, and returns a list of the results of dividing corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur, which is not handled in the code. Hence, the function may raise an exception instead of returning a valid list when division by zero is attempted. **
