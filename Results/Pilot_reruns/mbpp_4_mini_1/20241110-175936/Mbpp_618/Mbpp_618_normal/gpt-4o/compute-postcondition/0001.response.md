The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and they must be of the same length. Additionally, all elements in `list2` are non-zero to prevent division by zero errors. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the results of dividing corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length, and returns a list of the results of dividing corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`.**
