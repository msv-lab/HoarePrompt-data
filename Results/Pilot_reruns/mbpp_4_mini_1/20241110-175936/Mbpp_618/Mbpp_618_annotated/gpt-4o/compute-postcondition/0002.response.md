Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. If `list2` contains any zero values, this will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function does not handle this error or any cases where the lists are of different lengths. **
