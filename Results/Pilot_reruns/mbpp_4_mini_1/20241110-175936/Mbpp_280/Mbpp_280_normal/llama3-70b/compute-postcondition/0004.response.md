The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `arr` and `x` are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns `(True, 1)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 1)**
