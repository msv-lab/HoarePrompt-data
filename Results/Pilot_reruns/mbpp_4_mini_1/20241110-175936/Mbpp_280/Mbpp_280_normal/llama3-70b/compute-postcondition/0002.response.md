Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in `arr`. If `x` is equal to `elem`, the function returns (True, 0). If `x` is not equal to `elem`, the function does not return any value, indicating that the element was not found in the current check.***
