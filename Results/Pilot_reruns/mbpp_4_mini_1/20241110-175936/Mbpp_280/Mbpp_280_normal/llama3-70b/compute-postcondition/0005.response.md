Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `arr`. If `x` is equal to `elem`, the function returns (True, 1). If `x` is not equal to `elem`, the function does not return any value, and the program execution continues without returning True or any index.***
