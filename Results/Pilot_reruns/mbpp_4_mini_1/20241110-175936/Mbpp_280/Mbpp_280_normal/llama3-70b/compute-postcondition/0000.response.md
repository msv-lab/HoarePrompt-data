According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the index `i` should be initialized to 0 and `x` should be the first element in the list. The value of `elem` does not affect the execution of the loop. 

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
