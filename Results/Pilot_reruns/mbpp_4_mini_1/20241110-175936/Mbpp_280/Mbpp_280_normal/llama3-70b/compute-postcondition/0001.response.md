The function returns a tuple `(True, i)`, where `i` has a value of `0`. The values of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns `(True, 0)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 0)**
