According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list and the index `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` has at least 1 element, meaning it has a length of at least 1. Since the loop has not returned a value, we know that the element at index 0 (`x`, which is the first element in `arr`) is not equal to `elem`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `x` must be updated to the second element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`**
