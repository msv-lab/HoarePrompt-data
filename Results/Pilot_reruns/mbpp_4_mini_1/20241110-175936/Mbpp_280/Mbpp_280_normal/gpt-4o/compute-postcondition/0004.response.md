The function returns a tuple `(True, index)`. The variable `index` has a value of 1, which refers to the second element of `arr`. The return statement does not change the state of `arr` or `index`, but it indicates that the function returns `True` and the value of `index`. Therefore, the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and the function returns `(True, index)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and the function returns (True, 1)**
