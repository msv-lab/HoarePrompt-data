According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `index` will be the last index of the list and `value` will be the last element in the list. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and at the start of the loop, `index` should be 0 and `value` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, index is 0, value is the first element in the list**
