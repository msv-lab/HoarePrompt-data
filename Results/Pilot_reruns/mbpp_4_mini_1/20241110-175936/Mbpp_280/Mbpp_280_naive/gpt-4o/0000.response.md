Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly takes an array and an element as input, and it returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates whether the element is present in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). 

The provided assertions check various scenarios where the element is present in the array, and they return the expected results. The function iterates through the array with `enumerate`, allowing it to keep track of both the index and the value, and it correctly returns `(True, index)` when the element is found. If the loop completes without finding the element, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

The implementation handles all specified requirements in the problem description effectively.
