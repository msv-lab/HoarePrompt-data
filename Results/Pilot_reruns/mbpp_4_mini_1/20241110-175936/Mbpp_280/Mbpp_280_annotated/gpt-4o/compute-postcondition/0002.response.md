Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `index` is 0, and `value` is the first element in `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns (True, 0). If the first element of `arr` is not equal to `element`, the function does not return any value.***
