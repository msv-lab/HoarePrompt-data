The loop checks if a given `element` is present in the list `arr` and returns its index if found. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will not return any value.

Output State: **If `arr` is a non-empty list, the loop will return (True, index) where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found, the loop will finish executing without returning a value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no value is returned.**
