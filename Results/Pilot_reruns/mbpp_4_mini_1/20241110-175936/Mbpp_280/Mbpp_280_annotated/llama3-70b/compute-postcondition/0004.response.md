The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the value of `i`, which is 1. The return statement does not change the state of any variables, so the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and the function returns (True, 1).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and the function returns (True, 1)**
