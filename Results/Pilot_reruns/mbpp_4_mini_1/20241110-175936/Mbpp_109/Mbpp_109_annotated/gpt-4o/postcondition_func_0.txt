The function accepts a string `binary_str`, consisting of the characters '0' and '1', and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It performs `num_rotations` left rotations on `binary_str`, counts how many times the integer representation of the rotated string is odd, and returns that count. If `num_rotations` is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying `binary_str`. If `binary_str` is empty, it will remain empty after rotations, and the count will also be 0. Therefore, the function returns 0 in this case as well.
