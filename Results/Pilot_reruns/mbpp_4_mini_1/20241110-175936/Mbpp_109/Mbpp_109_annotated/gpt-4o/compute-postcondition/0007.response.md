The statement performs a left rotation on the string `binary_str`. The last character of `binary_str` becomes the first character, and the remaining characters shift to the right. The variable `num_rotations` is not affected, and `count` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `binary_str`, while `num_rotations` and `count` remain the same.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the updated string after one left rotation, `num_rotations` is greater than -1, `count` is 1**
