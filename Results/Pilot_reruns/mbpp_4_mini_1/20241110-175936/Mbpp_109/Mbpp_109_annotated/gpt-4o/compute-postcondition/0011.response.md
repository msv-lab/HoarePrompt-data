According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than -1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `num_rotations` must be at least 1. Since `num_rotations` was greater than -1 before, we can adjust it to be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, so no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`binary_str` is the updated string after one left rotation, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `integer_value` is the integer conversion of `binary_str` from binary to decimal, and `count` remains 1 or increments to 2 based on the value of `integer_value`.**
