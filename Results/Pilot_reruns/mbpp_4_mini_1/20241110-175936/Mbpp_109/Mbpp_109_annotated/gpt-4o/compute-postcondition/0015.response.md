Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the updated string after one left rotation, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and `integer_value` is the integer conversion of `binary_str` from binary to decimal. If `integer_value` is odd, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in either 2 or 3. If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains unchanged at 1 or continues to increment based on prior conditions.***
