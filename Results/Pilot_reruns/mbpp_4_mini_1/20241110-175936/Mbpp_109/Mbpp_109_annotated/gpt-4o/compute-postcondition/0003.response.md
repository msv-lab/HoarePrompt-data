The variable `integer_value` is assigned the value of `int(binary_str, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary_str` to its corresponding integer value. The previous values of the affected variables are `binary_str` (an updated string after one left rotation), `num_rotations` (greater than 0), and `count` (0). However, `num_rotations` and `count` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `integer_value`, which is the integer representation of `binary_str`.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the updated string after one left rotation, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str`**
