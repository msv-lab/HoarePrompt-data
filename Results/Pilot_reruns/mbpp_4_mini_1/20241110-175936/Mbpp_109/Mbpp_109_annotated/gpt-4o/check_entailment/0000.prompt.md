You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `binary_str` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0
    for _ in range(num_rotations):
        binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]
        
        integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
        
        if integer_value % 2 == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `binary_str` is the result of `num_rotations` left rotations of the original string, `count` is the number of times the integer representation of `binary_str` is odd after each rotation, and `num_rotations` is the non-negative integer indicating how many rotations were attempted. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `binary_str` remains unchanged while `count` remains 0. If `binary_str` is empty, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times, but since there are no characters to rotate, `binary_str` will remain empty and `count` will also stay 0.
    return count
    #State of the program after the return statement: `binary_str` is unchanged, `count` is 0, and the function returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `binary_str`, consisting of the characters '0' and '1', and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It performs `num_rotations` left rotations on `binary_str`, counts how many times the integer representation of the rotated string is odd, and returns that count. If `num_rotations` is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying `binary_str`. If `binary_str` is empty, it will remain empty after rotations, and the count will also be 0. Therefore, the function returns 0 in this case as well.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
