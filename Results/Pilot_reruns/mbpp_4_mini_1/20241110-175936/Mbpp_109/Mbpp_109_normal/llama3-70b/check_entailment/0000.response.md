To assess the correctness of the provided Python function based on the problem description, let's break down the analysis:

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string `s` a given number of times `n`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

1. **String Rotation**: The program duplicates the string `s` enough times to ensure that it can access up to `n` characters. This is a reasonable approach to handle rotations.
2. **Counting '1's**: The code counts the number of '1's in substrings of `s` starting from index `i` to `i + len(s)`. This aims to check for odd counts of '1's for each rotation.
3. **Parity Check**: The count is incremented if the count of '1's is odd (`temp.count('1') % 2`).

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string, `len(s)` would be 0, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `n // len(s)`. This case is not handled in the code.
- **Zero Rotations**: If `n = 0`, the function should ideally return 0. The current code does not have a specific check for this, but as `range(0)` yields no iterations, it would return 0, adhering to the description.
- **Single Character String**: If `s` is '0' or '1', the behavior should still be valid, but we should confirm that the counting logic works correctly for minimal lengths.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `s` is an empty string, which is a critical oversight as this could lead to a runtime error. The hints also point out potential issues when `n` exceeds the length of `s`, but the logic seems to accommodate that by repeating `s`.

### Final Assessment:
Since the function does not handle the case of `s` being empty, it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The existence of a runtime error in this scenario makes the function incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The function fails to address the edge case where the input string `s` could be empty, which would lead to a division by zero error during execution. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
