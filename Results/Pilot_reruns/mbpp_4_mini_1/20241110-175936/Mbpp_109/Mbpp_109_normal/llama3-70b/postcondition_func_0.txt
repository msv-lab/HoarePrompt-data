The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It calculates a new string `s` that is repeated enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`. It then sums the parity of the count of '1's in the substrings of `s` from index 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than the length of the original `s`, it processes substrings that may exceed the length of `s`, effectively using the repeated version of `s` to compute the count. The function does not handle cases where `s` is an empty string, which could lead to an error when calculating the length.
