The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. The parameter `s` is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than 0, the function computes `count` as the sum of the parity of '1's counts in the substrings of `s`, and `i` is set to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `count` as 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the sum of the parity of '1's counts in the substrings of `s` if `n` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns 0 if `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, returning the sum of the parity of '1's counts in the substrings of `s` if `n` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns 0 if `n` is 0.**
