According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, then the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_rotations` needs to be adjusted to one less than its current value. Since the loop variable is not used in the body of the loop, there are no other states that need to be changed.

State: **`binary_str` is the last character of the original `binary_str` concatenated with the rest, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `count` is 2 if the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is even, or 3 if it is odd, thus updating `count` accordingly. The `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2.**
