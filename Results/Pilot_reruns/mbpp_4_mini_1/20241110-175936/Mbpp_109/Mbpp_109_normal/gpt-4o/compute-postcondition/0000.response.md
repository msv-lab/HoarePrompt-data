The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `binary_str` and `num_rotations` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is 0.

Output State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is 0**
