Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `binary_str` consisting of '0's and '1's and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It rotates `binary_str` to the right `num_rotations` times and counts how many times the integer value of the rotated string is odd. The function returns this count, which will be 0 if `num_rotations` is 0, as no rotations occur and the original string is evaluated only once. **
