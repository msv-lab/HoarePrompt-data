To analyze the given program in relation to the provided problem description, we need to check if the implementation correctly counts the number of odd values obtained when rotating a binary string a specified number of times.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Rotation of the binary string**: The program rotates the string `num_rotations` times. Each rotation moves the last character to the front.
   
2. **Conversion to integer**: After each rotation, it converts the binary string to an integer using base 2.

3. **Counting odd values**: The program checks if the resulting integer value is odd (i.e., `integer_value % 2 == 1`) and increments the count accordingly.

Now, let's test the code against edge cases:

- **Single character binary string**: For example, `func_1('0', 1)`. The only rotation is the string itself, and its integer value is `0`, which is not odd. The expected count should be `0`.
  
- **All zeros**: Testing with `func_1('0000', 4)`, all rotations yield `0`, so the count should also be `0`.

- **Single odd character**: For `func_1('1', 1)`, the only rotation is the string itself, which has an integer value of `1`, so the count should be `1`.

- **Even-length binary string**: For `func_1('1100', 4)`, we get the rotations `1100`, `0110`, `0011`, `1001`. The odd integers from these are `3` (binary `11`) and `1` (binary `1`), so the count should be `2`.

Now, let's check the provided implementation with the edge cases:

1. **Test case `func_1('0', 1)`**: The count should be `0`, but the program would return `1` because it would rotate to `0`, check if it's odd (it isn't), and not increment the count. 

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the case of a binary string of all zeros or even just a single zero.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one input case.

Correctness: **False**.
