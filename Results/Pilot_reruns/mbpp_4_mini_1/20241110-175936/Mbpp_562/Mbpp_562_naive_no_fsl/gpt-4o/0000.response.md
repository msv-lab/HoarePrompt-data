Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function initializes `max_length` to 0.
2. It iterates over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`.
3. For each sublist, it checks if the length of the sublist is greater than the current `max_length`.
4. If it is, `max_length` is updated to the length of that sublist.
5. Finally, it returns `max_length`, which represents the length of the longest sublist.

The program has been tested with several assertions, which cover different scenarios:
- The first assertion checks a case with sublists of varying lengths and correctly identifies the longest sublist as having a length of 4.
- The second assertion verifies a case with different sublists, correctly finding the longest one with a length of 3.
- The third assertion includes longer sublists, and the function correctly identifies the longest as having a length of 5.

Since the code behaves correctly for all provided test cases and logically handles the problem as described, no edge cases have been overlooked. Thus, the function is correct in its implementation.
