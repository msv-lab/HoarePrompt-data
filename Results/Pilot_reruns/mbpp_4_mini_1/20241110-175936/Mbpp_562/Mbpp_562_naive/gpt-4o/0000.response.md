Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists. The logic iterates through each sublist, checks its length, and updates the maximum length found. The provided assertions confirm that the function works for those specific cases, and no edge cases or missing logic are evident. 

1. **For `[[1], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]`**, the longest sublist is `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, which has a length of 4.
2. **For `[[0, 1], [2, 2], [3, 2, 1]]`**, the longest sublist is `[3, 2, 1]`, which has a length of 3.
3. **For `[[7], [22, 23], [13, 14, 15], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]`**, the longest sublist is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, which has a length of 5.

Since the function behaves as intended for various input cases and correctly identifies the longest sublist, it is determined to be correct.
