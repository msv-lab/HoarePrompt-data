Postcondition: ***`max_length` is an integer representing the maximum length of sublists encountered. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. If `sublist` has a length less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least one sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.***
