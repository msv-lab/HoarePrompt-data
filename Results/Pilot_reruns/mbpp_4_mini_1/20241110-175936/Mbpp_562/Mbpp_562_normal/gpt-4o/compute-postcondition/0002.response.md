The value of `max_length` is assigned the value of `len(sublist)`, which calculates the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `max_length` is 0, but it will now be updated to the length of `sublist`. The state of `list_of_lists` and `sublist` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is `len(sublist)` (the length of the first sublist), and `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is `len(sublist)`, and `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
