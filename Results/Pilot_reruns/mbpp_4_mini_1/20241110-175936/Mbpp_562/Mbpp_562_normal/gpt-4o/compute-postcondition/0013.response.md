The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. After executing the function body, it calculates the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, which is assigned to `max_length`. The function then returns `max_length`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the length of the longest sublist within that list.
