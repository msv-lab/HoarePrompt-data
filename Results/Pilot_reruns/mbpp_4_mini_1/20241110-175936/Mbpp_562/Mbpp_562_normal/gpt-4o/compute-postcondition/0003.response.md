Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least one sublist. If the length of the first sublist is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to be equal to the length of that sublist. If the length of the first sublist is less than or equal to `max_length`, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
