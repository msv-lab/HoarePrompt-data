To evaluate the correctness of the given code based on the problem description and output hints, we first analyze the function `func_1`.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the length of the longest sublist within a given list of lists. It initializes `max_length` to zero and iterates over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. For each `sublist`, it checks if its length is greater than `max_length`, and if so, it updates `max_length` with the length of the current `sublist`. Finally, it returns `max_length`.

### Problem Description:
The problem description states that the function should return the length of the longest sublist. It also indicates that if the input list is empty, it should return 0. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List:** If `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), the function should return `0`. The current implementation does not explicitly check for this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
2. **Single Element Lists:** The code should also handle cases where there are single-element lists correctly, which it does.

### Output Hints:
The output hints mention that the function accepts a list of lists and returns the length of the longest sublist. They also state that if the input list is empty, it returns `0`, which the current implementation does not account for since it will simply return `0` as `max_length` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The function fails to handle the case of an empty input list correctly. While it returns `0` in that case, it does not explicitly check for it, so it could be less clear in intent. Therefore, based on the requirement to follow the problem description for all potential cases, the function is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.  
Explanation: The function does not explicitly handle the empty list case, which could lead to confusion regarding its behavior. A check for an empty input list should be added to clarify the intent and ensure correctness according to the problem description.
