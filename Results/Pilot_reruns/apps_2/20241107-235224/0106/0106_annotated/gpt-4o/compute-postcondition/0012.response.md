Functionality: **The function func_1 takes parameters n, m, k, a, b and calculates the total time required to go from location a to location b within a specified building. It determines the time required to exit the building, the time for a direct walk, the time for a reverse walk, and the time to reach the target floor. The total_time is then calculated as the sum of these individual time components.**
