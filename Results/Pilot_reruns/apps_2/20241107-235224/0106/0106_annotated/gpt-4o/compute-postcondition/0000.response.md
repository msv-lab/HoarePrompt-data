Example Answer:
The value of `block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` determines the block number of the given apartment. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, the output state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Cannot determine output state without the values of apartment, m, and k**
