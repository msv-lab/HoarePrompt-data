The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: n, m, k, a, b. These parameters are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 
After executing the function body, the function returns total_time, which is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept five positive integers n, m, k, a, b within the specified constraints, and calculate the total_time based on the given parameters. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, b and returns the total_time as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
