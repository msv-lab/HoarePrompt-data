The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The constraints for the input parameters are that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. Without knowing the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, it is not possible to determine the output state of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` cannot be determined without the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
