Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. However, without knowing the specific values of these variables in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Cannot determine output state without the values of apartment, m, and k**
