Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. The formula calculates the block number in which `a` falls. The previous values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are known, so `a_block` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, and `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, and `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`**
