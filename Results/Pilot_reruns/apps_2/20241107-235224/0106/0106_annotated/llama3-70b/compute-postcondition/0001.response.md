Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map` and `int`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers**
