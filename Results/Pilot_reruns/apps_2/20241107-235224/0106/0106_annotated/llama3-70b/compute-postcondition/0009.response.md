Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers within the valid range. `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block` are calculated based on the input values. `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
