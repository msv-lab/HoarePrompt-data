Example Answer:
`b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `b` is an input integer, `m` is an integer within the valid range, and `b_floor` is calculated based on these values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, and `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, and `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`**
