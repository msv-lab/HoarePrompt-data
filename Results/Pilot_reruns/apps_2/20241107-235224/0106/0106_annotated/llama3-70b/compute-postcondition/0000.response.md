Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting. Since the input values are integers within the specified range, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are within the valid range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range**
