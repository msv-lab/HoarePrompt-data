Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the provided values of `b`, `m`, and `k`, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, and `min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`**
