Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of `min_block_time`. The formula used to calculate `min_block_time` is not in accordance with the problem description. The code calculates `min_block_time` based on the minimum number of blocks to move between Edward and Natasha's apartments, which is incorrect.

In the problem description, it is specified that moving between adjacent blocks takes 15 seconds, and the time taken to move from one block to another is 10 seconds, regardless of the distance. The code does not account for this and incorrectly calculates `min_block_time` based on the difference between the blocks.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results.
