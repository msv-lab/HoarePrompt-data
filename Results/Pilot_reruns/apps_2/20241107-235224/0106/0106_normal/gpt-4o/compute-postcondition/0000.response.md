Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Given the preconditions, the values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are within the specified ranges. The output state is: **`m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated using the provided formula**.
