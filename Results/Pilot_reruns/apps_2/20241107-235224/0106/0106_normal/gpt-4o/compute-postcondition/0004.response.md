The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The function expects `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` as integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b. The variable `block` is calculated using a formula based on the values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `floor_within_block` is determined based on the value of `apartment`. The function returns the values of `block` and `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and calculate the block and floor within that block based on the provided constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the block and the floor within that block based on the provided constraints and relationships.**
