The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 

After executing the function body, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned valid block and floor numbers based on location `a`, while `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned valid block and floor numbers based on location `b`. 

If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. 

`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. 

`min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. 

`time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. 

`total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

The function returns `total_time`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, assigns valid block and floor numbers based on the locations a and b, calculates the total time required to move from location a to location b, and returns the total time.**
