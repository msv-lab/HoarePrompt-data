Example Answer: 
`floor_within_block` is calculated using the formula provided where `apartment` is not defined. The output state depends on the values of `m`, `k`, and `a`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated using the provided formula, `floor_within_block` is based on the value of `apartment`**
