Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `get_location`.
- The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor within that block based on the given constraints.
- The `func_1` function accurately computes the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, considering various walking and waiting times as described in the problem statement.
- The code handles the scenario where Edward lives on the first floor correctly by setting the time to exit as 0.
- It correctly calculates the time to exit the building, the shortest walking distance between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor.
- There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be addressed in the summary.
- The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the functions' logic.
- Considering the code's adherence to the problem description and the accurate implementation of the required functionalities, the code is correct.
