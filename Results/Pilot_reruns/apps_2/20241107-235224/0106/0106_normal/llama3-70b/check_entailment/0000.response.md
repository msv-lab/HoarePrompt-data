Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes input values for the number of entrances, floors, and apartments per floor, as well as the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha. It then calculates the floor and block numbers for both apartments according to the given formulas. After that, it determines the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha by considering the blocks and floors they are on, taking into account the time for block transitions and floor movements.

The code follows the problem description accurately by considering the circular structure of the building, the time taken for elevator and stair movements, and the optimal path for Edward to reach Natasha. Additionally, the output matches the expected output format of a single integer representing the minimum time required.

There are no specific edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description or output hints that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
