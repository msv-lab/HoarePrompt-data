Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly checks whether all the remainders are distinct as per the problem description. It iterates through each integer from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if it has been seen before using a set. If a remainder is found in the set, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, if all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The program follows the problem description for every potential case.
