Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo `i` are distinct for `1 ≤ i ≤ k`. It handles the case where `k >= n` and returns "No" in that scenario. It also uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns "No" if a duplicate remainder is encountered. Otherwise, it returns "Yes". The program follows the problem description for every potential case.
