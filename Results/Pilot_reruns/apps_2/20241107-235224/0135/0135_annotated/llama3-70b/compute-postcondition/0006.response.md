Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues execution without altering the initial state of the variables.***
