Output State: **If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is the current iteration, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits.**
