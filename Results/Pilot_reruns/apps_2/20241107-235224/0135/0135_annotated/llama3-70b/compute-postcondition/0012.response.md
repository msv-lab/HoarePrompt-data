Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is already in the `seen` set, 'No' is printed and the program exits.***
