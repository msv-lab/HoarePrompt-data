The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the result of n^k and returns the result. The input parameters n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of n^k. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the result of n^k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
