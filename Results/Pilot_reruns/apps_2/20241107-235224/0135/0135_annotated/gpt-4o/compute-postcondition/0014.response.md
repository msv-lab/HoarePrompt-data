The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function always returns the string 'No'. 

Case_2: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will iterate `k` times, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` for each iteration. If the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop continues until completion. After the loop, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `k` is adjusted to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` for the last iteration.

Case_3: The function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
