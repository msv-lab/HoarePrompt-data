Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will iterate `k` times, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` for each iteration. If the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop continues until completion. After the loop, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `k` is adjusted to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` for the last iteration.**
