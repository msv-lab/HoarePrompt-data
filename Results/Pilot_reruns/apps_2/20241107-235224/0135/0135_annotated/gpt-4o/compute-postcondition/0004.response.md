Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, but the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`**
