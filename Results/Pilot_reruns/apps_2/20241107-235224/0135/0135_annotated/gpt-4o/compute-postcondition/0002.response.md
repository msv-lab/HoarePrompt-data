Example Answer: 
The set `seen_remainders` is initialized as an empty set. This set will be used to keep track of the remainders encountered during the execution of the program. Since the initial state does not have any values for n and k, and the code snippet provided does not affect these variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function always returns the string 'No'. No other changes to the variables n and k occur.**
