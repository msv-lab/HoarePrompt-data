In order for the loop to execute, the loop range (1, k + 1) must be valid, meaning k + 1 is a valid upper limit for the loop range. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. 
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`**
