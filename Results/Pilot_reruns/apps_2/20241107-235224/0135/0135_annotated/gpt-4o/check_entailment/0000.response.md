Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks whether all remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns "No" if a remainder is already in the set, indicating that it is not distinct. Otherwise, it returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code logic and how it handles different cases. The code itself follows the problem description accurately by iterating through the range of 1 to k, calculating the remainder for each i, and checking if it is already in the set of seen remainders. If a repeated remainder is found, the code returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct.

Overall, based on the code and the problem description, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified.
