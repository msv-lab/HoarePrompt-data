According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `seen` is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
