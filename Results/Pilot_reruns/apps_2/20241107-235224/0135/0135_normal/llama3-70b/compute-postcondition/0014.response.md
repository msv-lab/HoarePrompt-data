According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an input integer. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
