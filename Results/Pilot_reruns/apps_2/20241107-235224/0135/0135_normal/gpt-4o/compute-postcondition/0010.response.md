Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value `n % i`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is calculated as n % 3.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `remainder` is calculated as n % 3**
