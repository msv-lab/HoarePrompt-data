According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3**
