The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.

Case_2: If `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is at least 1, the function checks if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`. If it is, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders calculated as n % i after each iteration.

Case_3: If `seen_remainders` is a set containing unique remainders calculated as n % i after each iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is at least 1, the function checks if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`. If it is, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine if there are any repeating remainders when dividing n by integers from 1 to k, and return 'Yes' if there are no repeating remainders and 'No' otherwise, with specific conditions for the values of n, k, and the state of the program variables.
