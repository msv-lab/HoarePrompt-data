Example Answer:
A remainder is calculated by taking the value of `n` modulo `i`. The previous values are `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2. Since the value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of the remainder. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2**
