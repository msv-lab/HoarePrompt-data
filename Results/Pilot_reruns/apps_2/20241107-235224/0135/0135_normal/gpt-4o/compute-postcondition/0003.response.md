According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `i` from 1 to k (inclusive). Since `k + 1` is the upper limit of the range, the loop will execute at least once if k is 0 or greater. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` being an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1**
