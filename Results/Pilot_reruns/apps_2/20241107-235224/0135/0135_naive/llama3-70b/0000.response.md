Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in two integers n and k as input, then iterates from 1 to k to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. It stores each remainder in a set to check if it has been seen before, if it has, then it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". This logic covers all potential cases as it ensures that all remainders are unique and correctly follows the problem description.
