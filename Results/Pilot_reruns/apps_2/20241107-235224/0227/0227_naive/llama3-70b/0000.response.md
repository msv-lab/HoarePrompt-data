Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The code sorts the input sequence 'a' and then iterates through it to check if each element is equal to the previous element multiplied by 2. If not, it increments the variable 'm'. Finally, it outputs the minimum number of variables 'm' or -1 if it exceeds 23. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
