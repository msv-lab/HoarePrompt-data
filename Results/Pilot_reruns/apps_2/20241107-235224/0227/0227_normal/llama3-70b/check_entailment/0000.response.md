Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values and sorts the list of integers `a`.
- It then iterates through the list to count how many elements are not twice the value of the previous element.
- The code then determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations.
- The code handles the case where it prints -1 if `m` exceeds 23.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output based on the given examples.
- Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
