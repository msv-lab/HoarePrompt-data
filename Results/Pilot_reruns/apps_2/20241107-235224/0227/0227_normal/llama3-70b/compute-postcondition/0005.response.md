Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `m` is 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2**
