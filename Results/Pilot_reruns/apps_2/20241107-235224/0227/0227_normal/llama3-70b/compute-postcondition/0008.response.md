Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` has been increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` has been increased by 1**
