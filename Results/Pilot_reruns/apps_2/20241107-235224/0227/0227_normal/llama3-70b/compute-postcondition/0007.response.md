According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` may or may not have changed**
