The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It then determines how many times a difference between two elements in `a` can be formed using elements in `a`. The function returns the count of times this difference cannot be formed, denoted by `m`. The function also updates the set `assigned` with all elements from `a`. If the first element of `a` cannot form any element in `assigned`, `m` is initialized to 2. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains at 1.
