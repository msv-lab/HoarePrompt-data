According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `assigned` is not empty. Since `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, it means `a` is not empty. Additionally, `m` being 1 and `i` being 1 are not relevant to the loop execution. The `can_form` being False does not impact the loop execution either. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must not be empty and `x` should be assigned the first element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False**
