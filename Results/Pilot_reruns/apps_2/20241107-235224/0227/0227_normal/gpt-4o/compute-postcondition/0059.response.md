Postcondition: ***If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and any element in `assigned` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop terminates. Otherwise, if the condition is not met initially, `m` is incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if the condition is met in the initial state, where `a[2] - x` exists in `assigned`. If `can_form` remains False after the if statement, `m` is increased by 1.***
