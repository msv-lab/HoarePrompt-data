According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i]`, `m` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `can_form` is False or True, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is either True or False**
