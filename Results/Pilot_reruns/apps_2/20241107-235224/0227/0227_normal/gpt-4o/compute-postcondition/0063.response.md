Output State: **`assigned` contains all elements from `a`, `m` is the number of times `can_form` was False, `n` is the length of `a`, `i` is the index of the last element checked, and `can_form` is True if a difference was found, False otherwise. If the first element of `a` cannot form any element in `assigned`, `m` starts at 2. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `m` remains at 1.**
