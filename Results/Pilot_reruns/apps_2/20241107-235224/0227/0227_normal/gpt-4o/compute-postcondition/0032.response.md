Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the next element after the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i+1]`, `m` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks.***
