Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
