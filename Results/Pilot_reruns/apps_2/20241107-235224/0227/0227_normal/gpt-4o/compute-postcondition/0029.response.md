According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop iterates over `assigned`, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `assigned` should be considered. 
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the next element after the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i+1]`, `m` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1**
