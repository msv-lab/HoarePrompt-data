Example Answer:
The variable `assigned` is initialized as an empty set. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set**
