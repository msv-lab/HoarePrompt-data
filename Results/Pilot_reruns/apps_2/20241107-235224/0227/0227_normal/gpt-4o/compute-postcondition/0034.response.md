Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is set to `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the next element after the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i+1]` and at least one more element, `m` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True.
