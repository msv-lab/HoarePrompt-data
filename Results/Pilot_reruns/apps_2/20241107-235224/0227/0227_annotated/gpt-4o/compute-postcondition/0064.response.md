The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order. During the execution of the function, the variable `assigned` is created containing all elements from the list `a`. Additionally, the variable `m` keeps track of the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution. The function returns the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of distinct positive integers `a` sorted in ascending order, and return the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution.
