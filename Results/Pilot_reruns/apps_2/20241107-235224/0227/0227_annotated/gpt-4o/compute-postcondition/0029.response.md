According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the `assigned` list should have at least one more element added from list `a` and the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
