Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `i` is i+1. The loop checks if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the `assigned` list for each element `x` in `assigned`. If the difference exists, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop does not find the difference in any element, `can_form` remains False. The loop will not execute if `assigned` is an empty list.
