According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `assigned` and if the condition `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` including the newly added element `a[i+2]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `i` is i+3, `assigned` has at least 2 elements. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `i` needs to be adjusted to i+3+1 which is i+4.
2. `assigned` should contain at least one more element than it currently has.
  
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` including the newly added element `a[i+3]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `i` is i+4, `assigned` has at least 3 elements**
