Output State: 
- If `assigned` is empty or `a` is empty, the loop won't execute and `can_form` will remain False.
- If there exists an element `a[i]` in list `a` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop terminates.
- `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least one, two, or three elements from list `a` respectively, `m` is greater than 0. If the loop executes 3 times, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0. If the difference between an element in `a` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated.**
