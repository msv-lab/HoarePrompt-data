Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is set to True. This changes the state of `can_form` from False to True. All other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]` after adding `a[i]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `i` is i+2, `assigned` has at least 1 element.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]` after adding `a[i]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `i` is i+2, `assigned` has at least 1 element**
