Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `i` is 0. The program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
