Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated.***
