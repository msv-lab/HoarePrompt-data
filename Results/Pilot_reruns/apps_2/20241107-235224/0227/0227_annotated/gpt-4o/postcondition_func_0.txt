The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the elements in `a` and checks if the difference between the current element and any previous element in `a` exists in `a`. If not, it increments a counter `m`. The function returns the final value of `m`, which represents the number of times the condition `can_form` was False during the loop execution. The functionality does not account for potential edge cases where the list `a` is empty, which would result in `m` being 1 instead of 0.
