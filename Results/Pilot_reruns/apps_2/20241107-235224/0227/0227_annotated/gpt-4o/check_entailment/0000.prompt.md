You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got a positive integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. All numbers in the sequence are distinct. Let's fix the set of variables b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. Initially each variable b_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.

The first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 ≤ i, j, y ≤ m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.

Your task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single number — the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.

If you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any m, print -1.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can use two variables b_1 and b_2 to perform the following sequence of operations.  b_1 := 1;  b_2 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2;  b_1 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order.
    assigned = set()
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set
    assigned.add(a[0])
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`
    m = 1
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, and `m` is 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #The loop iterates through elements in the list `a` and checks if the difference between the current element and any element in `assigned` exists in `assigned`. If not, it increments `m`. The loop will execute at least once as long as there are elements in `a`. If there are no elements in `a`, the loop will not execute, and the variables will remain in their initial state. After each iteration, the loop updates `assigned` by adding the current element from `a`. The final output state will have `n` as a positive integer, `a` as a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` containing all elements from `a`, `m` representing the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution. If `can_form` is False after any iteration, `m` is incremented by 1.
    return m
    #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` containing all elements from `a`, `m` representing the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution, and the function returns `m`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order. During the execution of the function, the variable `assigned` is created containing all elements from the list `a`. Additionally, the variable `m` keeps track of the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution. The function returns the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of distinct positive integers `a` sorted in ascending order, and return the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop execution.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
