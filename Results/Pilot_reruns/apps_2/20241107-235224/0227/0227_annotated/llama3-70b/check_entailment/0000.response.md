Correctness: False

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that they can help perform the described sequence of operations. However, the code logic is incorrect as it only checks if the elements in the list `a` are in an arithmetic progression with a common ratio of 2. This logic does not guarantee that the sequence of operations can be performed. 

For example, consider the input:
3
3 6 5

The correct output should be -1, as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the code will output 2, which is incorrect.
