Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the elements of the list `a` are distinct positive integers, the sorting operation rearranges the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in the list `a` in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in the list `a` in ascending order**
