Output State: **If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] multiplied by 2 for any i in the range of 1 to n, then m will be incremented by the number of times this condition is met. Otherwise, m will remain 1. n is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, a is a list containing at least n distinct positive integers in ascending order.**
