Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned 1. Since `m` is directly assigned the value 1, the previous values of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in the list `a` in ascending order, `m` is 1**
