Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the string and then calculates the prefix balances using a prefix sum approach.
3. It correctly handles cases where the balance is 0 and checks for the desired balance in the prefix balances list.
4. It then counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance and appends the count to the results.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for each test case.
