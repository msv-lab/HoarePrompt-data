Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `n` and `x` are dependent on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space**
