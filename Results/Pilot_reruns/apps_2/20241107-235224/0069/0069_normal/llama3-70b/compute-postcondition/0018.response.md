Example Answer:
`balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space. The formula `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is calculated and printed. The output state does not mention any changes to the initial variables.
Output State: **T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1**.
