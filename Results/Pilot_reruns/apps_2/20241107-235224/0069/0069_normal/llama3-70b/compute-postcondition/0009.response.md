Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then the code prints -1 but does not affect the state of any variables. Otherwise, `n` is assigned a value from input, `x` is assigned a value from input, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The code then prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`.***
