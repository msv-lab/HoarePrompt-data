Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is not 0, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1.***
