Output State: **If T is positive, the loop will execute T times. Each iteration assigns integer values to n and x from the input after splitting by space. The variables cnt0 and cnt1 are updated based on the count of '0' and '1' in the input string s. The balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is not 0, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1. This logic covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring proper output. If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the values of n, x, cnt0, cnt1, balance remain unchanged.**
