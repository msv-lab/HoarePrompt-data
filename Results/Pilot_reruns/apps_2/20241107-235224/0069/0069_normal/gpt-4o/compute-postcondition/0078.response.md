According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value at `data[2]`, `balance` is the result of the initial calculation based on `data[1]` and `data[2], and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value at `data[2]`, `balance` is the result of the initial calculation based on `data[1]` and `data[2], `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1**
