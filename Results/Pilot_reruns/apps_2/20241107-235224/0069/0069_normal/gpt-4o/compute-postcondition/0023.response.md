Example Answer: 
The variable `count` is assigned the value 0. The loop calculating the prefix sum of balances in the string `s` won't execute if `n` is 0 or negative, so `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros**
