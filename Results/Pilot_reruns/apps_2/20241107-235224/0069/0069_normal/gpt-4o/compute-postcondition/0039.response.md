Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Since `data` and `index` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list**
