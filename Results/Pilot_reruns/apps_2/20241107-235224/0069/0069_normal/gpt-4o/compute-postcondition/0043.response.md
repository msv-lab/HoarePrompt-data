Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The `prefix_balances` list is now updated to have `n + 1` zeros. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `index` is increased by 3**
