According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` equals `n+1` to satisfy the condition `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3, `i` is equal to `n+1`**
