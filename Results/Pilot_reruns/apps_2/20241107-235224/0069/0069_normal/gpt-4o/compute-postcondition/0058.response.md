Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `count` is updated, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `results` will contain updated values after the loop, `index` is 3, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances. If (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the division result is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is incremented by 1.***
