Output State: 
If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. The loop will continue to update `prefix_balances[i]` until `i` reaches `n + 1`. The values of `x` and `s` will remain the same throughout the loop. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and no updates will be made to `prefix_balances[i]`.
Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value and s[i - 1] until i reaches n + 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. x and s remain unchanged.**
