Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` where each element is 0. The previous values of `n`, `x`, `s`, and `balance` are not affected by this initialization.
Output State: **`n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value at `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the calculation**
