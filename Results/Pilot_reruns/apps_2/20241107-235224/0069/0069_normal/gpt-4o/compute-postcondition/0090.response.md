Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 1. If the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied, `count` is incremented by 1. This ensures that `count` is increased by 1 while maintaining the initial conditions of `n` and `prefix_balances`.***
