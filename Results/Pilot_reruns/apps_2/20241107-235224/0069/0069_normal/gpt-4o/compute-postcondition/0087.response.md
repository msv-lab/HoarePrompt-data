Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned the value 0. There are no changes to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value and s[i - 1] until i reaches n + 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. x and s remain unchanged. `count` is 0.
Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value and s[i - 1] until i reaches n + 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. x and s remain unchanged. `count` is 0**
