Example Answer: 
The list `results` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `data` is a list of strings, `T` is an integer, and `index` is 1. The initialization of `results` does not change the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
