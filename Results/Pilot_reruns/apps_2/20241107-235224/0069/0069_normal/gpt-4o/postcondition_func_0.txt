The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it based on specific constraints, and prints the results. It involves parsing input data, calculating balances, and determining counts based on certain conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input data read from the standard input. The results are printed after processing the data. Potential edge cases include handling scenarios where the input data does not meet the expected constraints, such as negative values for `n` or `T`.
