Correctness: False

In the given program, the logic to calculate the number of prefixes of t with balance equal to x is not correct for all potential cases. Specifically, the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` to determine if there are infinite prefixes is not accurate.

An example where the program fails is for the input:
```
1
5 1
10101
```
For this input, the correct output should be 2, as there are 2 prefixes of t with balance equal to 1. However, the program will output -1 according to the current logic, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the Correctness is False.
