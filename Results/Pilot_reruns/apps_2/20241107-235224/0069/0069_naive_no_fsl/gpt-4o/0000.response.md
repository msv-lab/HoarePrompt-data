Correctness: False

For the given program, the logic to calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ is incorrect. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the balance is zero, but the desired balance $x$ is not in the prefix balances. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs 0 instead of -1. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 0
1010
```
The correct output should be -1 since there are an infinite number of prefixes with a balance of 0. But the program will output 0.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness False.
