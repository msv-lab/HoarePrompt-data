Example Answer:
The input entered by the user is stored in variable `s`. The variables `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user.
Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user**
