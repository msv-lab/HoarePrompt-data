Example Answer:
The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. Since the initial state mentions T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, we can assume that the inputs will be valid integers. Therefore, after execution, the values of `n` and `x` will be the integers entered by the user.
Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user**
