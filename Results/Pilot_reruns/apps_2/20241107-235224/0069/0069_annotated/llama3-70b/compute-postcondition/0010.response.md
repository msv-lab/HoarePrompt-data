Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n and x are integers entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all scenarios, ensuring the proper execution of the program and handling of edge cases.***
