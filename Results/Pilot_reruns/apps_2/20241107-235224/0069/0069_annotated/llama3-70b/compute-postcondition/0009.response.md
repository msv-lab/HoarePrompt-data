Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n and x are integers entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution, ensuring the proper handling of edge cases.***
