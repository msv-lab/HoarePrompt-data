Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, n and x are integers entered by the user, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, s is a string entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s. If balance equals x, n+1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1 is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios including edge cases like division by zero, ensuring the program functions correctly.***
