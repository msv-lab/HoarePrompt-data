According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `T`. It needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n and x are integers entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1.**
