According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. In this case, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length n+1. The loop iterates from 1 to n+1, so for the loop to execute, the list must have at least 2 elements (since n+1 is at least 2) and the index `i` should start from 1. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
