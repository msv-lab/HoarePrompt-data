According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`, `n` remains the same**
