Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances[i]` is updated for each i from 1 to n based on the previous value and the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2], `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in string s, `count` contains the number of times the conditions are met, `results` contains either -1 or the appended count based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If balance is 0, -1 is appended to `results` if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise 0 is appended. If balance is not 0, the count is updated based on the conditions, and the final count is appended to `results`. After the execution, `prefix_balances`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `results`, count, and n maintain their respective states as described above, considering all edge cases and conditions.***
