Output State: **If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros. If balance is 0, results appends -1 if x is in prefix_balances, otherwise results appends 0. If balance is not 0, count is incremented by 1 for each b in prefix_balances such that (x - b) is divisible by balance and the result is non-negative. In all cases, prefix_balances contains at least (n+1) elements, with b being the (n+1)th element in the list. If n is 0, count remains 0. results contains the appended count.**
