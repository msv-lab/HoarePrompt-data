According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `prefix_balances` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated for each i from 1 to n, so the loop can execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2], `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in string s, `count` is 0, `results` is empty, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
