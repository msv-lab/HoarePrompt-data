Example Answer:
The value -1 is appended to the list `results`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; results contains -1.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; results contains -1**
