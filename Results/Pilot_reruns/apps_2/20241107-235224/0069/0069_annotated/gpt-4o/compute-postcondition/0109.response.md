According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results list. If the list has at least 4 results, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, results contains at least three results, and the specific result is ready for processing. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the results list must contain at least 4 results. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If n is at least 1, prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index, balance is 0 or not 0, x is in prefix_balances or not, count is incremented correctly, results contains at least 4 results, and the specific result is ready for processing**
