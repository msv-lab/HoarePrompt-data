According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `T` is an integer value greater than 0 extracted from the first element of `data`, `_` is 0, `index` is assigned the value 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 2 of `data`, `s` is assigned the string value at index 3 of `data`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in `s` up to that index, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances` is updated where each element represents the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in `s` up to that index**.
