Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances[i]` is updated for each i from 1 to n based on the previous value and the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2], `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in string s, `count` is 0, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`.***
