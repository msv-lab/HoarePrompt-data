According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n+2`.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+2`, `n` remains the same**
