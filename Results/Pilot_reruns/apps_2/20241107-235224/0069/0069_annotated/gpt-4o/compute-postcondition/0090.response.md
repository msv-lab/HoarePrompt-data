Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element based on `s`. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then `count` is equal to the number of elements in `prefix_balances` + 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains the same as the number of elements in `prefix_balances`. `n` is less than or equal to 0 if the loop does not execute.***
