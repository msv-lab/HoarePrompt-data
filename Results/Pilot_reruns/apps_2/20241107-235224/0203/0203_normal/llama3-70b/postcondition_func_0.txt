The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `fractions` from the user input. The string consists of characters 'D' or 'R'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if there are more 'D's, and 'R' if there are more 'R's. The function does not explicitly return any value.
