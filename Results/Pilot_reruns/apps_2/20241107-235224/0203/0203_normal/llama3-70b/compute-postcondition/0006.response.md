Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1, and the previous values of `remocrats` are 0. Therefore, after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1**
