Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `n` will be a valid integer within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
