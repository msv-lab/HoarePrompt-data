According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are fractions to iterate over. Since `fractions` is assigned the user input value, it implies there is at least one fraction to iterate over. Therefore, the loop can execute.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
