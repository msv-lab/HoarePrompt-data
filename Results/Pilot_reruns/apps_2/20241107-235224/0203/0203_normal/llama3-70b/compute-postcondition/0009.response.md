Example Answer:
The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, so after execution, `depublicans` increases by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, and `depublicans` count is updated.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, and `depublicans` count is updated**
