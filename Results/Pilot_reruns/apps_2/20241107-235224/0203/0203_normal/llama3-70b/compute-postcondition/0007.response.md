Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value. If the value of `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If the value of `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.***
