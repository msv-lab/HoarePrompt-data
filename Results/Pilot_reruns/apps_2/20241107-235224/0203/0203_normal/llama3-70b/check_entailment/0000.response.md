Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads the number of employees and their fractions, counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R', then prints 'D' if there are more 'D's, and 'R' if there are more 'R's. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code and do not provide any additional cases that are not handled by the code. Thus, the code is correct.
