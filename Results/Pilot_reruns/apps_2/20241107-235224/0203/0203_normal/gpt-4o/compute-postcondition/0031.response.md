Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. The value of `r_queue` will be modified due to the pop operation, and `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`**
