Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting only of 'D' and 'R' characters. It then processes the votes by categorizing them into 'D' and 'R' queues based on their indices. It continues processing the queues by moving indices and appending new values until one of the queues becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, or 'R' if the 'R' queue is not empty. The function does not return any value.**
