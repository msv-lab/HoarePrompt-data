Output State: **If there are 'D' and 'R' characters in the input `votes`, the loop will continue to execute until either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty. At that point, the output state will have `n` as the input integer, `votes` as the original string, and the values of the `d_queue` and `r_queue` lists will depend on the presence of 'D' and 'R' characters in `votes`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and new values will be appended to the respective queues if the conditions are met. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, the loop will terminate. If there are no 'D' characters in `votes`, `d_queue` will remain empty. If there are no 'R' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` will remain empty.**
