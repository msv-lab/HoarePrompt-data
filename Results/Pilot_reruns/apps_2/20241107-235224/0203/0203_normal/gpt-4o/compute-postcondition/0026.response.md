Example Answer:
`d_index` is added to `n` and appended to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_index` and `n` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` has values including `d_index + n`, `r_queue` has values, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is updated with the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` has values including `d_index + n`, `r_queue` has values, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is updated with the popped value from `r_queue`**
