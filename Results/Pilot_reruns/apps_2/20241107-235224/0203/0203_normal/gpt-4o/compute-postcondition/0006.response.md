Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, after execution, the `r_queue` list will contain [0]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains [0], `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains [0], `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
