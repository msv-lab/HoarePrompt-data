Example Answer:
The value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `d_index` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0**
