Example Answer:
Since the code snippet only initializes the variable `depublicans` to 0 and does not interact with any other variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**
