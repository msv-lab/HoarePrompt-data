According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input fractions list. If the list has at least 4 characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains at least 3 characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'. If the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` will increase by 3; otherwise, `remocrats` will increase by 1. The final state after the execution of the if else block is that either `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0, or `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the input fractions list must contain at least 4 characters.
