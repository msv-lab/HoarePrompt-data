According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list contains at least 1 character, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 0. Therefore, to execute the loop, the fractions list must have at least 1 character, and the initial values for `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains at least 1 character, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
