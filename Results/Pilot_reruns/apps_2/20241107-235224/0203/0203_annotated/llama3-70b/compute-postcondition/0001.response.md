Example Answer: 
The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of the input, which contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and the input is a list of characters, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'**
