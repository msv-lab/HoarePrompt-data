`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The variable `depublicans` was not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
