According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more fractions to iterate over in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains at least 2 characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'. If the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` will increase by 2; otherwise, `remocrats` will increase by 1. The final state after the execution of the if else block is that either `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0, or `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next fraction should be available in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
