The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing characters 'D' or 'R'. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on user input.
