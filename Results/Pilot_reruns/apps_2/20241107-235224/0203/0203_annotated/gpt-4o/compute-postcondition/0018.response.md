Example Answer:
The code pops the first index from the d_queue and assigns it to d_index. If d_queue is empty, an error will occur. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will be empty. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.
Output State: **After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will be empty. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.**
