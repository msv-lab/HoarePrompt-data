Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the input string votes consists of n characters, each character being either 'D' or 'R', the total number of characters in the string will be n. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive. The input string votes consists of n characters, each character is either 'D' or 'R'**.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive. The input string votes consists of n characters, each character is either 'D' or 'R'**
