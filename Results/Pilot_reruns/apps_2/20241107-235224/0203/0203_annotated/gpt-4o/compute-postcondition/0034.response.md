Postcondition: ***r_queue is updated after removing the first element, r_index is assigned the popped value. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue appends the result of d_index + n. Otherwise, r_queue is updated with the new element, and r_index is assigned the popped value added to n. Ensure that the state of the variables is maintained throughout the execution of the if else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
