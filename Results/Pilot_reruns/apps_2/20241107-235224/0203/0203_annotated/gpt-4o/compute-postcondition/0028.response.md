Postcondition: ***After the execution of the code, the value of d_index is the index of the popped 'D' character from d_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue has the appended value of d_index + n. Otherwise, r_queue has the appended value of r_index + n. The state of r_queue, r_index, and n is dependent on their specific values.***
