According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the states are described. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `d_queue` is not empty, append `d_index + n` to `d_queue`.
- If `r_queue` is not empty, append `r_index + n` to `r_queue`.
State: **After the if-else block executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will contain the incremented value of r_index + n. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If d_index < r_index, d_queue will be appended with d_index + n. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, r_queue will be appended with r_index + n.**
