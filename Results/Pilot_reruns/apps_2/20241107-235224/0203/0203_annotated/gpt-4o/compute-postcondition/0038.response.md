Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are initially non-empty, the loop will execute until either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty. After the loop finishes, the state of d_queue, r_queue, d_index, r_index, and n will be determined based on the specific values and relationships between the variables.**
