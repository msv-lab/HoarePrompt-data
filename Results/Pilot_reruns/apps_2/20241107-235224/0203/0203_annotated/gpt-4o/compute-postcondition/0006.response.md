Example Answer:
r_queue is a list, and i is 0. The value of i is appended to the r_queue list. As i is 0, the r_queue list will now contain [0]. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, votes is a string consisting of n characters, each character is either 'D' or 'R', i is 0, v is the first character in the string, r_queue contains [0].
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, votes is a string consisting of n characters, each character is either 'D' or 'R', i is 0, v is the first character in the string, r_queue contains [0]**
