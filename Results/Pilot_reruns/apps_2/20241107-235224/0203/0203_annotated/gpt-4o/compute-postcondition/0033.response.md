Example Answer:
r_queue is updated after removing the first element, and r_index is assigned the popped value. The value of r_index is added to n and then appended to r_queue. Therefore, r_queue is updated with the new element, and r_index has the popped value added to n.
Output State: **r_queue is updated with the new element, r_index is assigned the popped value added to n**
