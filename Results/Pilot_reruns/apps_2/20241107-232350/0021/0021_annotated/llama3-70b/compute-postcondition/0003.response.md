Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of `n` in the list `a` would be `n-1`. Therefore, `posn` is assigned `n-1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1**
