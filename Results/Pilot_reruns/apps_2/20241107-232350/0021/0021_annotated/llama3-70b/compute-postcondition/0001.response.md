Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of integers obtained by mapping the input split values to integers. The input contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where 2 <= n <= 100. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
