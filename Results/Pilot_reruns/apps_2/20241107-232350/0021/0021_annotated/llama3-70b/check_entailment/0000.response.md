Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and computes the maximum and minimum distances between them. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achievable by swapping the elements. The provided annotations also align with the logic of the code and describe the state of the program accurately at each step.
