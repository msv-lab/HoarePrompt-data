You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nicholas has an array a that contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. In other words, Nicholas has a permutation of size n.

Nicholas want the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) to be as far as possible from each other. He wants to perform exactly one swap in order to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the permutation.

The second line of the input contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), where a_{i} is equal to the element at the i-th position.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
4 5 1 3 2

Output
3

Input
7
1 6 5 3 4 7 2

Output
6

Input
6
6 5 4 3 2 1

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, one may obtain the optimal answer by swapping elements 1 and 2.

In the second sample, the minimum and the maximum elements will be located in the opposite ends of the array if we swap 7 and 2.

In the third sample, the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements is already maximum possible, so we just perform some unnecessary swap, for example, one can swap 5 and 2.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The input array `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
    pos1 = a.index(1)
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1
    posn = a.index(n)
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1
    max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2
    min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2
    print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, and the code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a predefined input array `a` which contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The function does not return any value, but it performs some operations based on the input array `a`.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
