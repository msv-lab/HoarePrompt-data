Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which takes an input and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, but since `a` is not explicitly assigned in the code snippet, we cannot determine the exact values in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
