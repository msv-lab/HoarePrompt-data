Example Answer: 
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, and `min_pos` is 0. Therefore, `dist3` is assigned the value of 0. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is 0**
