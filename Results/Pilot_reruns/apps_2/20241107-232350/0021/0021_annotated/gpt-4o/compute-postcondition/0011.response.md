Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the elements 1 and `n` in the list `a`. The function prints this maximum distance as the output. The function does not return any value explicitly. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` consists of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It's important to note that the function lacks explicit return statements and primarily focuses on calculating and printing the maximum distance. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` or `a` do not meet the specified constraints, which could lead to potential errors if input values are not within the defined range.
