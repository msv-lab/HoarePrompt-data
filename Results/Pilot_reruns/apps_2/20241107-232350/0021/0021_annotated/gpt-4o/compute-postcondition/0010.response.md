The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it accesses the variables `n` and `a` within its scope. The parameter constraints state that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n. 

The functionality of the function `func` is to work with the values of `n` and `a` that meet the specified constraints. The function does not have a return value explicitly defined in the description provided.
