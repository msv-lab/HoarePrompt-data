Example Answer:
The `max_distance` variable is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. Since the values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are 0, the maximum value will be `n - 1` which is the value of `dist4`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is equal to `n - 1`, and `max_distance` is equal to `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is equal to `n - 1`, and `max_distance` is equal to `n - 1`**
