Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array. It then calculates the four possible distances between these elements and the ends of the array. The maximum distance is then calculated and printed, which corresponds to the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after exactly one swap. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
