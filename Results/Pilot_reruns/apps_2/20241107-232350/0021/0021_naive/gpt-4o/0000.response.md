Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum positions of the elements 1 and n in the array. Then, it calculates the distances of these elements from the extreme positions of the array and finds the maximum possible distance. This logic works for all potential cases as it considers all possible scenarios for swapping the elements to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.
