Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer n followed by a list of n distinct integers, which aligns with the problem description.
- It correctly calculates the maximum distance between the index of 1 and the index of the maximum integer in the list, as well as the minimum distance.
- The final output is the maximum value between these distances and n - 1 - min_dist, which is consistent with the problem description.
- The logic of swapping the positions of 1 and n to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements is correctly implemented.
- The code covers the scenarios where the maximum distance is already optimal, and unnecessary swaps are performed.
- The code handles edge cases such as having the minimum and maximum elements at the ends of the array or having the minimum and maximum elements already at maximum distance from each other.
