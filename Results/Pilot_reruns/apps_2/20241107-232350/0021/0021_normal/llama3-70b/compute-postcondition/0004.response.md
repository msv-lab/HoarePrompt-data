Example Answer:
The maximum distance between pos1 and posn is calculated by taking the absolute difference between their indices and subtracting 1. If pos1 is closer to the beginning of the list than posn, the distance will be posn - pos1 - 1. Otherwise, it will be pos1 - posn - 1. If pos1 and posn are adjacent, the distance will be -1. In this case, the maximum distance will be n - 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a, posn is the index of the maximum integer in the list a, and max_dist is calculated as defined.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a, posn is the index of the maximum integer in the list a, and max_dist is calculated as defined**
