The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the global variables `n` and `a`. The parameter constraints state that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n. The function does not have any explicit return value specified.
