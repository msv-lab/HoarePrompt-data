Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a, posn is the index of the maximum integer in the list a, max_dist is calculated as the absolute difference between pos1 and posn, min_dist is calculated as the minimum of (pos1, n - 1 - pos1, posn, n - 1 - posn), and the code prints the maximum value between max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist**
