Functionality: **The function reads an integer n followed by a list of n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the index of 1 and the index of the maximum integer in the list, along with the minimum distance. Finally, it prints the maximum value between these distances and n - 1 - min_dist. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on the global variables `n` and `a`.**
