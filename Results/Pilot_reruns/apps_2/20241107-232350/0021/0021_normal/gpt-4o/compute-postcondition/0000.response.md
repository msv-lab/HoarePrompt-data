Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the value of `n` is restricted to be between 2 and 100, the output state is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**
