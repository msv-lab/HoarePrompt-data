Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100 and `max_pos` is `n - 1`, the value of `dist2` will be between 1 and 99. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is `n-1`; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99; `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and a number between 1 and 99.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is `n-1`; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99; `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and a number between 1 and 99**
