Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array. In this scenario, the code should not perform any swap and should return the maximum possible distance as it is. However, the code currently does not account for this case and will perform an unnecessary swap, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
