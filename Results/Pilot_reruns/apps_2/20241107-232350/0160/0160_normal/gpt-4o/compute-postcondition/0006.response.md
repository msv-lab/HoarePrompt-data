Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors` which already contains {1, x // i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the set `divisors` will contain {1, x // i, i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i, i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 2**
