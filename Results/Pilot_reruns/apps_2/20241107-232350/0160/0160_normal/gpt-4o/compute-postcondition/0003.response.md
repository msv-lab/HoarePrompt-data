Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` initially contains only 1, after this operation, it will contain the result of `x // i`. The output state is: `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i}, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i}, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
