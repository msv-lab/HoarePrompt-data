According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` is not empty. Therefore, `x` needs to be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. 
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
