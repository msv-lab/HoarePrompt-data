According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `x` inclusive. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will include `i` and `x // i` as additional divisors. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2, i, x // i} where `i` has been increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be increased by 1 to account for the next iteration. Since `i` is being increased by 1, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2, i, x // i} where `i` has been increased by 2**
