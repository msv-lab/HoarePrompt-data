According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the square root of `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. The set `divisors` is updated with the values 1 and the integer division result of `x` by `i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. No changes are made to `divisors` if `x` is not divisible by `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the value of `i` and possibly the set `divisors`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 2.**
