Example Answer:
After executing the code, the value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The initial state mentions that `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i, i}, where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, `x // i` will be equal to x // 2. Therefore, the updated set `divisors` will contain {1, x // 2, 2}.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2}**
