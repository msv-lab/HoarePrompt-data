Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`. The value of `A[0]` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 10^6. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N; gcd is an integer between 1 and 10^6.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N; gcd is an integer between 1 and 10^6**
