Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`, where `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `gcd` is 1. Since `gcd` divided by `i` results in 1 due to integer division, the new `max_divisor` will be the maximum between the current `max_divisor` and 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` and 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` remains 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` and 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` remains 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1**
