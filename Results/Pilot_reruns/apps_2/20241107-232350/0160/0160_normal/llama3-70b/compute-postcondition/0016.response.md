Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` remains 1, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`.***
