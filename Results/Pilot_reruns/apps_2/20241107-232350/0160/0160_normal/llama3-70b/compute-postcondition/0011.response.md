Output State: **After the loop executes, `max_divisor` will be the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`. If `N` is less than 2, the loop will not execute and `max_divisor` will remain the initial value. If `gcd` is initially 1, then after the loop executes, it will remain 1 regardless of the values in `A`. `N` and `K` will remain unchanged.**
