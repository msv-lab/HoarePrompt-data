According to the code, the loop will execute if `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1. In this case, `max_divisor` will be the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`. 
State: **`max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` is initially 1 and after the loop executes it will remain 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1**
