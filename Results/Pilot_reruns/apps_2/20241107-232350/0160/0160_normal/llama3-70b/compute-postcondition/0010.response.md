Output State: **After the loop executes, gcd will be the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, N and K will remain unchanged. If N is less than 2, the loop will not execute and gcd will remain the initial value. If gcd is initially 1, then after the loop executes, it will remain 1 regardless of the values in A.**
