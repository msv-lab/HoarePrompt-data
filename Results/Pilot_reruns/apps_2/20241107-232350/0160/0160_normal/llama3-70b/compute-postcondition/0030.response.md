The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses the following parameter constraints: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N. The function performs some operations based on these constraints, but the specific functionality and return value are not provided.
