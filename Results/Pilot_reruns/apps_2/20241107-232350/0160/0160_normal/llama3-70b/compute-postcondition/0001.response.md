Example Answer:
The list `A` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this code. The values of `A_i` are already integers, so they remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N**
