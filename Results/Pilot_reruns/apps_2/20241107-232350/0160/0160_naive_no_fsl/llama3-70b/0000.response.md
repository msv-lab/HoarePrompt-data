Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The program first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find all possible divisors and selects the maximum one. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the program outputs the correct result for any given input.
