Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program first takes the input N, K, and the list of integers A. It then calculates the sum of all elements in A. The program defines two functions: func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers, and func_2 to find all the divisors of a given number.
The program then iterates through the divisors of the sum of A in descending order, and for each divisor, it checks if that divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. If it satisfies the condition for all elements, it prints that divisor and breaks out of the loop.
The logic of the program seems correct as it iterates through all divisors of the sum of A and checks if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. Since the program covers all potential cases and accurately finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A, it can be considered correct.
