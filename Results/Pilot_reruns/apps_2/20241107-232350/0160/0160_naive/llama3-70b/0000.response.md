Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly reads the input values, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the array A, and then finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The program iterates through all potential divisors of the gcd and finds the maximum one that satisfies the condition. The logic seems sound and covers all possible cases according to the problem description. The program also handles the constraint of 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the given problem description.
