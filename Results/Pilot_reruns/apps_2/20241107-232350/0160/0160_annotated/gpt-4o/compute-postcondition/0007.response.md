Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is divided by the updated value of `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. `i` is then incremented by 1. The previous state of `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the previous value of `i` and adding both the previous divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the previous value of `i`. Therefore, after execution, the updated set `divisors` will include the new divisor found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding it to the existing divisors.
Output State: **`divisors` is updated to include the new divisor found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` in addition to the existing divisors**
