Output State: 

- If x is a positive number, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `divisors` will be a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including both the individual divisors found by dividing `x` by `i` and `x` divided by `i`. The variable `i` will be the last valid divisor checked before the loop ends.
- If x is 0, the loop won't execute at all, and `divisors` will remain an empty set.
- If x is a negative number, the loop won't execute at all, and `divisors` will remain an empty set. 

Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` when x is a positive number. If x is 0 or negative, `divisors` remains an empty set.**
