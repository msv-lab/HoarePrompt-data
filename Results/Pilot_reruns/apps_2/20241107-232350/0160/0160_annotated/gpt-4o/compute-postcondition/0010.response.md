Example Answer:
The code adds the updated value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` now contains all the divisors of `x` including the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1.**
