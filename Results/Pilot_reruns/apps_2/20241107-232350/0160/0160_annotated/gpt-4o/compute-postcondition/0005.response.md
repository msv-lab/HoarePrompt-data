According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, where `x` is a positive number. The set `divisors` includes the divisors found by dividing `x` by `i` and adding both the divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by `i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the set `divisors` needs to be updated to include the divisors found by dividing `x` by the new value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the new value of `i`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the new value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
