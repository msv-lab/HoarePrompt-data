Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. Since `x` is a positive number and `i` is 1, the result of `x // i` will be the same as `x`. Therefore, the value of `x` will be added to the set `divisors`. The output state is: `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
