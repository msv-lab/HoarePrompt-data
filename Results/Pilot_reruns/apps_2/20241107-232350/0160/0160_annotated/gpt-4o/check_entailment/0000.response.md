Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The two provided functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the annotations.
- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after the operations.
- `func_2` correctly finds all the divisors of a positive integer, which is needed to determine the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list.
- The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description and should work correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
- Thus, the code should output the correct maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after the operations.
