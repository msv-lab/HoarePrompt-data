Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements starting from the second element if there are at least 2 elements in the list. If there are less than 2 elements in the list, the function returns the initial value of the first element in the list as the GCD. The function uses the math.gcd function to compute the GCD of the elements in the list.
