Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`, where `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` and `i` is 1. Since `gcd` is a positive number, the maximum value between `gcd` and 1 is `gcd`. Therefore, after execution, `max_divisor` remains the same as `gcd`, and `i` is still 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1**
