Example Answer: 
The `gcd` is updated by taking the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the value of `A` at index `i`, which is `A[3]`. The `gcd` value is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list of N integers, K is a non-negative integer, updated `gcd`, and `i` is 3.
Output State: **A is a list of N integers, K is a non-negative integer, updated `gcd`, and `i` is 3**
