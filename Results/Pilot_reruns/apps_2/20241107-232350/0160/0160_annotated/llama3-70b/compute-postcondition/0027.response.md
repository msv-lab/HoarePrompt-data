According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, where `gcd` is a positive number, and `i` is 3. Since `i` is 3, the loop condition is satisfied (`i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, where `gcd` is a positive number, and `i` is 4**
