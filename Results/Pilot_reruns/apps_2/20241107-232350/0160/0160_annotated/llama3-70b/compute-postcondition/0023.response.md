Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is reassigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`, which is 3. Since `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, and `gcd` is a positive number, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` (which is a positive number) and 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is a positive number, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is a positive number, `i` is 3**
