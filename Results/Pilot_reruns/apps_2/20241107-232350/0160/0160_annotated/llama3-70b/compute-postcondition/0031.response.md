Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `N` and `K`, then reads a list `A` of `N` integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list `A` and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. This maximum divisor is printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
