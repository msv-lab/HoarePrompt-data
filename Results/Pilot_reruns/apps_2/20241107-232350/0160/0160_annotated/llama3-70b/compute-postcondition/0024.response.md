Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `gcd` is not defined. Since `max_divisor` is a positive number and `i` is 3, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum between the previous `max_divisor` value and the integer division of an undefined `gcd` variable with 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated to a new positive number.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated to a new positive number**
