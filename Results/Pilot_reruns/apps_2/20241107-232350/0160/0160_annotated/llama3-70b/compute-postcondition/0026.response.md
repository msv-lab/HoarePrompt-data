Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, where `gcd` is a positive number, and `i` is 3. If the condition `gcd % i == 0` is satisfied, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd` divided by `i`. If the initial condition is not met, there are no changes to `max_divisor` or `i`.***
