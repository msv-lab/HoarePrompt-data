Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` where `gcd` is a positive number. `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_divisor` or `i`.***
