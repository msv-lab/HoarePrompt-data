Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. The current value of `max_divisor` is the maximum between `gcd` and 2, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. 
Output State: **`max_divisor` is the maximum between the current value of `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`, `i` is 2**
