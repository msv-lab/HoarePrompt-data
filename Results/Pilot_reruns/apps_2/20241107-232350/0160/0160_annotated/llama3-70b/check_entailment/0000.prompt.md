You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    #State of the program here: A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N, K are assigned values from the input split
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N, K are assigned values from the input split
    gcd = A[0]
    #State of the program here: A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N, K are assigned values from the input split; gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A
    for i in range(1, N):
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, A[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If N is at least 2, then gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A. If N is 1, gcd is the only element in list A. If N is less than 1, gcd is undefined. If K is 0, the loop will not execute and gcd will remain the same as the first element in list A.
    max_divisor = gcd
    #State of the program here: `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, where `gcd` depends on the initial state of N and A
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1):
        if gcd % i == 0:
            max_divisor = max(max_divisor, i)
            if i * i != gcd:
                max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If gcd is a positive number, max_divisor will be the maximum divisor of gcd after the loop executes. If gcd is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and max_divisor remains gcd.
    print(max_divisor)
    #State of the program here: If gcd is a positive number, max_divisor will be the maximum divisor of gcd after the loop executes. If gcd is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and max_divisor remains gcd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
