Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input of N, K, and the list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Finally, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd using a loop and prints the result. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
