Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the functionality to perform the k-rounding of a given positive integer n. The function `func_1` calculates the multiplier based on the value of k and then computes the result x by multiplying n with (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and the multiplier). This ensures that x is the minimum positive integer that ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The examples provided also demonstrate that the code works correctly for various inputs. Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is determined to be **True**.
