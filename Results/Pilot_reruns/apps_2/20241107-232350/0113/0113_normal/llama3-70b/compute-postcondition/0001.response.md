Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` has a value between 0 and 8. Since the value of `k` can be between 0 and 8 inclusive, the value of `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
