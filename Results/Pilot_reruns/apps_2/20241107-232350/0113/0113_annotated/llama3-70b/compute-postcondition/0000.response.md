Example Answer: 
`n` and `k` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input separated by space and converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `k` depend on the input provided, which should be within the specified constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
