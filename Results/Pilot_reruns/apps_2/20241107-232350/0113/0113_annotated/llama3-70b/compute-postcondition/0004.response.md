Example Answer:
n is incremented by 1, but the previous value of n is unknown. x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of k. Therefore, the output state is: x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of k, n is incremented by 2.
Output State: **x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of k, n is incremented by 2**
