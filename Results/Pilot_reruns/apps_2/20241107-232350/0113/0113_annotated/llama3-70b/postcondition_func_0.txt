The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates a value `x` as 10 to the power of `k`. It then increments `n` until it becomes the smallest multiple of `x` greater than the initial `n`, and finally prints this resulting value. The function does not return any specific output based on the given parameters.
