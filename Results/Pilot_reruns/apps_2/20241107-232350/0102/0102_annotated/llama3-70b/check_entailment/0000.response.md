Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes an input integer `s` representing Tavas's score and converts it into words following the English numerals. The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It covers the cases where the score is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and 20 or greater. The program uses the provided arrays `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` to map the integer score to its corresponding word representation. The logic within the `if-else` block ensures that the correct word representation is printed based on the value of `s`. The annotations also accurately describe the state of the program and the actions taken based on the value of `s`. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible cases.
