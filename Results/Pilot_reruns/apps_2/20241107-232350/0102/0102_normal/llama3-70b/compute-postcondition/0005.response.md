Example Answer:
The code prints the value at the index `s - 10` in the list `teens`. Since `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, `s - 10` will result in an index between 0 and 89 in the `teens` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99**
