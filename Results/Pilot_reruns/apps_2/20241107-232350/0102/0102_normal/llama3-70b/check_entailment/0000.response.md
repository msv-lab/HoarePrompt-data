Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles numbers between 0 and 99 and prints the corresponding English word for that number. The code uses the `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` lists to construct the output string based on the value of `s`. The logic covers scenarios where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and 20 or greater. Additionally, the code uses a hyphen if the number is not a multiple of 10 when constructing the output string. The output hints also confirm that the code is doing what is expected based on the problem description.
