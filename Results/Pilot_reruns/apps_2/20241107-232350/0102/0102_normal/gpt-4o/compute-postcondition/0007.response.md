Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number. Otherwise, the function concatenates the string at the tens place with the string at the ones place separated by a hyphen.***
