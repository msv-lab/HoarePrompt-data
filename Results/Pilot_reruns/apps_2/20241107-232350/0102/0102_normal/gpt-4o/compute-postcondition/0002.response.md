Example Answer: 
The list `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90. The previous value of `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90**
