Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function concatenates the string at the tens place with the string at the ones place separated by a hyphen. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
