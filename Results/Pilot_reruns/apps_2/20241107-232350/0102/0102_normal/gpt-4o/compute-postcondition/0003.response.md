Example Answer: 
The function returns the element at index `n` in the list `ones`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, the function returns the string representation of the number at that index. The state of the variables `n` and `tens` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90, and the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90, and the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n`**
