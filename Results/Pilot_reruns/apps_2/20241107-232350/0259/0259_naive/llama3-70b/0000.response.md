Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the arrival time of each bus for the given time Serval goes to the station, and finds the bus route that Serval will use based on the minimum time difference. The program iterates through all the bus routes and calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the first bus of each route and the time Serval goes to the station. It then updates the minimum time difference and the corresponding bus route index. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use. Since the program considers all possible cases and correctly determines the bus route based on the minimum time difference, the program is correct.
