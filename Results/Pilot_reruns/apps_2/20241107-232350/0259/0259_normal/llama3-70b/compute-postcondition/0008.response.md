According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split**
