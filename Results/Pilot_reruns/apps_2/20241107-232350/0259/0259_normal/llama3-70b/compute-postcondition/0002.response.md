According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. The loop iterates `n` times, so at least 1 iteration is required. Before the loop starts, `buses` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, and `_` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
