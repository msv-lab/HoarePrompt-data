According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 2, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the split input converted to integers, and a new tuple is added to the `buses` list**
