Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The variables `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
