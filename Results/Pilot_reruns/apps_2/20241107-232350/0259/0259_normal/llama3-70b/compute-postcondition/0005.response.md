According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
