Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are the input integers provided initially. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
