Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input integers n and t, then reads n pairs of integers and stores them in a list called buses.
- It calculates the minimum time based on the input values and prints the corresponding index correctly.
- The code handles the case where n is 0 or negative by not adding any buses to the list and outputting -1.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases as described in the examples given.
