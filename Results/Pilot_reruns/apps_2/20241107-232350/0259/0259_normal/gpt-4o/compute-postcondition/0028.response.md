Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `i` is one more than its previous value, `s_i` is assigned the value of the source from the bus_routes at index `i`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the destination from the bus_routes at index `i`. The `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the program fragment. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the wait time calculation, including edge cases involving the values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.***
