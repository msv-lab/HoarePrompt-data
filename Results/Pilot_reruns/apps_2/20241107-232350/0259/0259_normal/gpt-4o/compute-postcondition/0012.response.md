According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `n` and `t` are positive integers, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. The variables `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to one more than its current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: *`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `i` is one more than its previous value, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged*
