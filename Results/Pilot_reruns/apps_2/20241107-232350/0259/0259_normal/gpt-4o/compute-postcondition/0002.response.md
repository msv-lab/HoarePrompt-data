According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1 does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
