Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then reads the arrival time and interval between buses for each route. The code calculates the time it takes for Serval to reach each bus route and determines which route Serval will use based on the minimum time. The code then prints the index of the chosen bus route. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
