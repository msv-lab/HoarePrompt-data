The function reads an input integer n followed by n pairs of integers representing bus schedules (s, d). It then calculates the minimum wait time for a bus arrival based on the current time t and the schedules. Finally, it prints the index of the bus with the minimum wait time. If the input n is 0 or negative, the function does not execute the loop and does not print anything.
