According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `buses` list. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is assigned the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, the `buses` list must have more elements for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_time` is assigned the minimum value among the previous `min_time` and `time`, `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged**
