According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuple(s, d) along with the newly appended tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuple(s, d) along with the newly appended tuple**
