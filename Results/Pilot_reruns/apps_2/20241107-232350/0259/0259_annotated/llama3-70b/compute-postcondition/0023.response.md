Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to `i + 1`, where `i` is a variable whose value is unknown. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but after execution, `ans` will be `i + 1`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`min_time` is the same as `time`, `ans` is updated to `i + 1**
