Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, and the list `buses` now contains an additional tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuple(s, d) along with the newly appended tuple**
