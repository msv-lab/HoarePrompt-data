Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values are converted to integers using `int()`. The effect on other variables is none. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer**
