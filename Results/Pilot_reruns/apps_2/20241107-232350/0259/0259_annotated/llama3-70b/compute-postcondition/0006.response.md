Example Answer: 
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split by space. The input is taken as integers and split into `s` and `d`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer**
