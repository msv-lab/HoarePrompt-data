According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `n` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer**
