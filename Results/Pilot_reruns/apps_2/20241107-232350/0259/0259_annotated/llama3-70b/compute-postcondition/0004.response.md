Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, and the list `buses` was initially empty. After execution, the `buses` list will contain the tuple `(s, d)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer**
