The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route, respectively. After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will hold the minimum wait time calculated among all bus routes, and `chosen_route` will be updated to the index of the route with the minimum wait time (starting from 1). If `n` is 0, `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will update `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the conditions specified in the loop code, and the function returns the updated `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the route with the minimum wait time based on the input parameters and return the index of that route.
