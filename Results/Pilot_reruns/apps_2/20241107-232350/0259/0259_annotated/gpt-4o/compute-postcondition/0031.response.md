Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is either 0 or the minimum value between `wait_time` and `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` where `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to the route index `i + 1`. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
