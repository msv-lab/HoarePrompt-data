Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `min_wait_time` is set to 0; otherwise, `min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`. In all cases, `chosen_route` is updated to either the route index `i + 2` if the condition is true or 3 if the condition is false. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.***
