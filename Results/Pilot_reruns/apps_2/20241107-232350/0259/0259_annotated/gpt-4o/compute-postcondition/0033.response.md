Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will hold the minimum wait time calculated among all bus routes, `chosen_route` will be updated to the index of the route with the minimum wait time (starting from 1). The loop will not execute if `n` is 0, in which case `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will update `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the conditions specified in the loop code.**
