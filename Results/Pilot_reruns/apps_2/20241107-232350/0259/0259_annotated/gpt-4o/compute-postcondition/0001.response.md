Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. Since `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.
Output State: **min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
