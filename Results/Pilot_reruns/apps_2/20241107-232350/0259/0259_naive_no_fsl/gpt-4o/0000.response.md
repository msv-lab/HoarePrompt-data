Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time and the intervals between bus arrivals.
3. The program then correctly determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time and returns the route number.
4. The output matches the expected output for the provided examples.
5. The program iterates through all bus routes and correctly handles cases where the first bus of a route arrives after Serval goes to the station.
