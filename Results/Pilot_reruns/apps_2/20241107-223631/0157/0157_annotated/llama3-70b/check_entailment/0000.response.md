Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the minimum number of lemons that Nikolay can use based on the ratios given in the problem description, but it does not consider the total number of apples and pears that can be used along with the lemons. The code simply prints the sum of the minimum lemons with 2 times the lemons and 4 times the lemons, which is not the correct approach.

For example, if we take the input (2, 3, 2) as mentioned in the problem description, the correct output should be 0 since Nikolay does not have enough pears to cook any compote. However, the code will output 3 (1 + 2 + 4) according to the calculation in the code, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
