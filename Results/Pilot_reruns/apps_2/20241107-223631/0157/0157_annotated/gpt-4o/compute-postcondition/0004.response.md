Example Answer: 
`max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, `total_fruits` will be `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, `total_fruits` is the calculated total number of fruits**
