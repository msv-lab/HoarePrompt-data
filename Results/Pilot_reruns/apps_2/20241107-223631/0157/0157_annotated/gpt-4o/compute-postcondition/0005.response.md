Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `total_fruits`. The value of `total_fruits` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate it. The only value that has been assigned is `max_lemons`, which is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
