Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum of the possible number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used based on the given ratio and then calculates the total number by multiplying the minimum with the respective ratio values. The logic is correct for all potential cases as it ensures that the ratio is maintained while using the fruits. The program handles the scenario where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote by setting the total number to 0 in such cases. The program works as expected for all possible inputs.
