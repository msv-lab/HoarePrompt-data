Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote by finding the minimum of the ratios of each fruit type that is available. It then multiplies this minimum value with the corresponding ratios to get the total count of fruits that can be used. The logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the compote is made in the required ratio.
