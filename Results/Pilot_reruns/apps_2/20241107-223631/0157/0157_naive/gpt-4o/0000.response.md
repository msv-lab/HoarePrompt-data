Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote while maintaining the 1:2:4 ratio. It takes the minimum of the quantities of lemons, apples (divided by 2), and pears (divided by 4) to determine the maximum number of compotes Nikolay can make. Then it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the max_lemons with their respective ratios and prints the total fruits. The logic provided in the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring the correctness of the program.
