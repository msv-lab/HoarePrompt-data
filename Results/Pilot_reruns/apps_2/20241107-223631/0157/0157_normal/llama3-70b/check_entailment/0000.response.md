Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has.
- It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to ensure that Nikolay has enough fruits to maintain the 1:2:4 ratio required by the recipe.
- Finally, it prints the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote by multiplying the minimum value with 1, 2, and 4 respectively.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that Nikolay can only cook the compote if he has the right ratio of fruits.
