Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and checks if the characters in `s` match the characters in the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If all characters in the target string are found in order in `s`, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1. The program handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target string as a subsequence by checking if `j` reaches the length of the target string. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
