Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes the input string and iterates over each character in the English alphabet. For each character, it checks if it exists in the input string and replaces it with the next character in alphabetical order. If the resulting string contains all 26 English alphabet characters, it prints the string, otherwise it prints -1. The program handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the alphabet subsequence by checking the length of the resulting string. Since the program iterates over each character in the English alphabet and replaces it in the input string until all characters are covered, it will always output the correct result.
