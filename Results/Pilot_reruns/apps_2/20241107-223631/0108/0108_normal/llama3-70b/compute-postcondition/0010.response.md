Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is: `s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
