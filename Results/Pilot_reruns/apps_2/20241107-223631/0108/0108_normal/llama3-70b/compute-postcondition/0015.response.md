Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The value of `char` is the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`. Therefore, the character `char` is added to `res` in each iteration.
Output State: **`s` is not empty and contains the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`; `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
