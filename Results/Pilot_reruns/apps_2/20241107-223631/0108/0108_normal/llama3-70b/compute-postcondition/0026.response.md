Example Answer:
`char` is appended to the `res` string in each iteration. The value of `res` will contain all the characters that were appended in each iteration including `char`. The state of `s` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char`.
Output State: **If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char**`
