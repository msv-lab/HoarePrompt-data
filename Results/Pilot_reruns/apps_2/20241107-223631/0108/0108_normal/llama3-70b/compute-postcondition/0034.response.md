According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. Also, after each iteration, `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be in the updated `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in the updated `s`**
