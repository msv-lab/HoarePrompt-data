According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the character `char` is found in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop was able to execute, so `char` was found in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `char` variable needs to be adjusted to a character that is also present in the string `s` at least one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
