According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `s` is not empty and contains the character `char` from the `alphabet`. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `s` should still not be empty and should contain the next character from the `alphabet` after the last character that was processed. Additionally, `res` will have the characters appended in each iteration. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is not empty and contains the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
