Example Answer: 
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The value of `s` changes accordingly. The `res` variable is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration.
Output State: **`s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
