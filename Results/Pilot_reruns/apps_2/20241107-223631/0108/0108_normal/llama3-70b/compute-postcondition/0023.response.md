According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is still present in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet. To ensure the loop can run again, `s` needs to be modified such that it contains the character after the next occurrence of `char` in the alphabet. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the character after the next occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration including `char`**
