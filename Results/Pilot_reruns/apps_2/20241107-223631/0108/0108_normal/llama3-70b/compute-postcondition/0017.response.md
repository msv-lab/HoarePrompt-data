According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `s` needs to contain the next character in `alphabet`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the next character in `alphabet`; `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
