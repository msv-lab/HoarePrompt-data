According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` should be the character that was replaced in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
