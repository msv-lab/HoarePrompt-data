According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `alphabet`. Since `alphabet` is not defined in the initial state, it needs to be defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `alphabet` string.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
