Output State: **If `s` is not empty and contains `char`, `res` will contain all characters appended in each iteration, `s` will have `char` replaced by the next ASCII character. If `s` is empty or does not contain `char`, the loop won't execute. If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `s` remains the same and `res` will be empty.**
