Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced by the character that is 1 greater in ASCII value. The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The `res` variable is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`char` is appended to `res`**
