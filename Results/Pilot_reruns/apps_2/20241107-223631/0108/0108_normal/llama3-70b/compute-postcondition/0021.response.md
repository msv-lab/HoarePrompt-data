Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but `char` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet. Therefore, after execution, `res` will have the characters appended in each iteration including the character `char` and `s` will still contain characters beyond `char` in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration including `char`**
