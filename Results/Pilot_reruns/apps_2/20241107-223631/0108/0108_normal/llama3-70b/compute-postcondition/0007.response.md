Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The length of `s` is between 1 and 10^5, and the character `char` is a lowercase English letter. Therefore, after execution, the updated string `res` will have the character `char` appended to it.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
