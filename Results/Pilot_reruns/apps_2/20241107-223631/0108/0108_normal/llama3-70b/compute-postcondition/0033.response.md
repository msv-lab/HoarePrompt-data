Example Answer: 
The character `char` is replaced in string `s` with the character that comes next in the ASCII sequence. The replacement occurs only once. After execution, the updated `s` will contain the replaced character. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in `s`, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the character that comes next in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in `s`, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the character that comes next in the ASCII sequence**
