Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` and iterates through the alphabet, appending characters to `res` if they are found in `s` and replacing them with the next ASCII character in `s`.
- If the length of `res` reaches 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1.
- The code follows the problem description by checking if it can obtain a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence.
- The code handles the edge case of not being able to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by printing -1.
