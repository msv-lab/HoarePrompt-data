Output State: **If the loop executes completely, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is equal to the length of the string `s`, and `j` is less than `target_len`. If `j` does not reach `target_len`, it means `target` is not completely matched in `s`. If `len(s)` is less than `target_len` or if there are characters in `s` that do not match the corresponding characters in `target`, the loop ends before completing and `i` is less than the length of `s`.**
