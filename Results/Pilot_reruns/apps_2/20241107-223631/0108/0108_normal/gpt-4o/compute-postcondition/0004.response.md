Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. After execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1**
