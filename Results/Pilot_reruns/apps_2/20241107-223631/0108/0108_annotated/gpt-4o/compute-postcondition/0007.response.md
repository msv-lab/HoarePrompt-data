According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`, then `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`.**
