Example Answer:
The value of `char` is concatenated to `res`, and `char` is then incremented by 1. The original value of `char` before replacement is present in `res`, and the new value of `char` is also present in string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`, `char` is incremented by 1 and the new value of `char` is also present in string `s`.
Output State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`, `char` is incremented by 1 and the new value of `char` is also present in string `s`**
