Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced by the character 1 position ahead in ASCII value within the string `s`. The original value of `char` is stored in the variable `res`. After replacement, `char` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is incremented by 1.
Output State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is incremented by 1**
