Example Answer: 
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The variable `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` still remains in the modified string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`**
