Postcondition: ***If any character in the alphabet is present in the string `s`, the loop will iterate through each character, replacing it with the next character in the alphabet and adding the original character to `res`. The loop will continue as long as the current character is present in `s`. If a character in the alphabet is not in `s`, the loop will not execute for that character. After the execution of the program fragment, if the length of `res` is equal to 26, the function will print `res` containing all the characters that were replaced in `s`, and `s` will have the characters replaced by their next alphabet character. If the length of `res` is not equal to 26, the function will print -1. This ensures that the program handles the case of all characters being replaced and printed in `res`, as well as the case where the replacement process is incomplete, leading to the printing of -1.***
