Example Answer:
The `char` variable is replaced in the string `s` with the character that is one position ahead in the ASCII table. The original value of `char` before replacement is stored in the `res` variable. After replacement, `char` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, and `char` is further incremented by 1.
Output State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is further incremented by 1**
