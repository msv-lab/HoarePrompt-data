According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet` string. The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `alphabet` string to iterate over. 

Before the loop starts, `s` being a string consisting of small English letters ensures that the loop can execute as `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters. 

For the loop to execute, the `res` being an empty string doesn't play a role in the loop execution. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters**
