Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is incremented by 1, and `res` is concatenated with the new value of `char`. The previous value of `char` is unknown, so the new value of `res` depends on the unknown value of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is incremented by 1.
Output State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is incremented by 1**
