According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, and char is further incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of char after incrementing should still be in s. 
State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is further incremented by 1**
