Example Answer:
The `replace` method replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The original value of `char` before replacement is stored in `res`, so after execution, the new value of `char` is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`, `char` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`, `char` is incremented by 1**
