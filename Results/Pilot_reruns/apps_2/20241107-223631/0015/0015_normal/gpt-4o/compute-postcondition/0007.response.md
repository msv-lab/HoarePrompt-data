Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the quotient is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
