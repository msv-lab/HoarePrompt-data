Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence (b == a), then the program correctly outputs "YES".
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), then the program correctly outputs "NO" since the sequence will not contain Vasya's favorite number.
3. If the favorite number appears in the sequence with the given difference between neighboring elements, the program correctly outputs "YES".
4. If the favorite number does not appear in the sequence with the given difference between neighboring elements, the program correctly outputs "NO".

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
