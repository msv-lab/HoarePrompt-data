Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description by checking if Vasya's favorite number b can appear in the sequence defined by the starting element a and the difference between neighboring elements c. The code handles the edge cases where c is 0 and a equals b, as well as cases where (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and confirm that the program covers all possible scenarios based on the input values of a, b, and c. The examples provided also align with the expected output according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
