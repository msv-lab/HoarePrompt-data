Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the program outputs 'YES'. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the program outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases where the condition is false or the division result is negative, 'NO' is printed. The program accounts for all possible scenarios involving the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring the correct output based on the specified conditions and handling edge cases effectively.***
