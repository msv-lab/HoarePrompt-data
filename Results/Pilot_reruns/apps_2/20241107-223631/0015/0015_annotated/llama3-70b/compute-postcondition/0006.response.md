Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program handles cases where the result of (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative, in which case 'YES' is printed. It also covers cases where the condition is false, leading to 'NO' being printed. Additionally, it considers all possible edge cases related to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to ensure the correct execution.***
