Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `can_form_number` function where it checks if a number can be formed using the cubes. The function checks if each digit in the number can be found on any face of any cube, but it does not consider the fact that the cubes can be rotated to form the number.

For example, consider the input:
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

The correct output should be 98, but the code will output 0 because it does not consider the possibility of rotating the cubes to form the number.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
