Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where Masha cannot make consecutive numbers due to the absence of a required digit in any of the cubes. For example, if Masha has the following cubes:

```
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 0 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8
```

In this case, Masha cannot form the number 89 because there is no cube with the digit 9. The program will output 87, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
