Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith value is set to True if the condition is met, `found` is set to True if the condition is met, and `i` is 0.
