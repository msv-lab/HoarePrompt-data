Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, which overwrites the previous value of `found` being True. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is decremented by 1, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
