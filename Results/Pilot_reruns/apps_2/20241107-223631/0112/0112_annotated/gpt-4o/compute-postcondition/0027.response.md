According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decremented by 2, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the list of digits must have more elements, and the loop will start processing the next digit. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is decremented by 2, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `digits` has more elements left to process**
