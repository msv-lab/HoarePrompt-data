According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n` and whether a cube with the digit is found. If `n` is greater than 0 and a cube with the digit is found, the loop continues executing. At the end of the last iteration, the state includes n, cube_faces, num, digits, used_cubes, found, and i. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- If `n` is greater than 0 and a cube with the digit is found, then `n` should be decremented by 1.
- If a cube with the digit is found, the corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` for that digit should be set to True.
- If a cube with the digit is found, `found` should be set to True.
- The iteration count `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is decremented by 1, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
