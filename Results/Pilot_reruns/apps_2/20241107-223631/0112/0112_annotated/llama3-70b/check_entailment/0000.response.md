Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads the number of cubes Masha has and the faces of each cube. It then extracts the unique digits present on the cubes (excluding '0') and forms the largest number that can be made from these digits. The code correctly handles the case where '0' is present on one of the cubes and removes it before forming the largest number. The output of the program matches the problem description as it finds the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. The program seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples.
