According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, cubes is a list of lists, so we need to ensure that there is at least one cube in the list. Additionally, since `cube` is being iterated over, we need to set it to the first cube in the list at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, and `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes**
