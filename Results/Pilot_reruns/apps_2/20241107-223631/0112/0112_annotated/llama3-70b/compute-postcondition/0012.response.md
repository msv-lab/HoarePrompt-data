Postcondition: ***The loop updates the set `digits` with unique string digits from each cube in the list `cubes`. If `cubes` is a list with at least one cube, the loop will execute at least once, and `digits` will contain the unique string digits of the first cube. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. After the execution of the if statement, if '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The resulting `digits` set contains unique string digits of cube(s) without '0', preserving the initial state of the program variables.***
