Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated with unique string digits from the second cube. The previous values of `digits` and `cube` are known, but `cubes` is not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the second cube updated, and `cube` is still the second cube in the list of cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the second cube updated, and `cube` is the second cube in the list of cubes**
