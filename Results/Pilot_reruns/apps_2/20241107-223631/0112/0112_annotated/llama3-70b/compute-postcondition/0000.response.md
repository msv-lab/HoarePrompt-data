Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the precondition states that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, the value of `n` after input will be between 1 and 3. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 3.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3**
