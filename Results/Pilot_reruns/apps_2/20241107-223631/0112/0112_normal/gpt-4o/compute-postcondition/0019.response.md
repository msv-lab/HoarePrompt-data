According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are in their initial states. After the execution of the if block within the loop, `found` is set to True. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found` are in their initial states, `i+1` is incremented by 1**
