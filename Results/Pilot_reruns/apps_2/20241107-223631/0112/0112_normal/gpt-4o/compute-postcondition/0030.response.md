The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a positive integer. It also has a **Precondition** that `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, and `cube_faces` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube. 

The function has two cases:
Case_1: If `digits` is not empty and `n` is greater than 0, the function will iterate through each digit in `digits` and check if it is present in any of the cube faces. If a cube containing the digit is found and it has not been used before, it will mark the cube as used and set `found` to True. If no cube contains the digit or all cubes have been used, `found` will remain False. The loop will execute at most `n` times. If `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop will not execute. After the loop finishes, if `found` is still False, the function will return False.

Case_2: The loop will not execute as `digits` is empty or `n` is 0. Therefore, the function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, iterate through each digit in `digits`, check if it is present in any of the cube faces, and return False if the digit cannot be formed using the cubes provided.
