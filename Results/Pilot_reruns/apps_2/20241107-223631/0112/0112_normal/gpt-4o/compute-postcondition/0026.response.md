Example Answer:
The variable `found` is set to False. Since `found` was already set to False in the initial state, there is no change in its value. The variable `digits` still has at least one more element. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element.
Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element**
