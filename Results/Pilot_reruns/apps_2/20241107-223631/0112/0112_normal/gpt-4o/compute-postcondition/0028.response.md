Output State: **If digits is not empty and n is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through each digit in digits and check if it is present in any of the cube faces. If a cube containing the digit is found and it has not been used before, it will mark the cube as used and set found to True. If no cube contains the digit or all cubes have been used, found will remain False. The loop will execute at most n times. If digits is empty or n is 0, the loop will not execute. After the loop finishes, if found is still False, the function will return False.**
