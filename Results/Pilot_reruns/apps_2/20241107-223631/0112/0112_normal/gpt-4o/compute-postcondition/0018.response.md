Postcondition: ***`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, and `i+1` are in their initial states. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged. `i` is less than `n+1`. After the execution of the if block, `found` is set to True and the loop or if statement is exited. All other variables retain their initial values.***
