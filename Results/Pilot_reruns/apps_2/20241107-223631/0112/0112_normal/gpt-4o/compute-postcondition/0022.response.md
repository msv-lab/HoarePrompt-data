Postcondition: ***If the digit is present in any of the cubes' faces, the loop will mark the first cube containing the digit as used, set `found` to True, and break. If no cube contains the digit or all cubes have already been used, `found` remains False. The loop will execute at most `n` times. If `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and `found` will remain False. After the execution of the if statement, if `found` is not True, the function returns False.***
