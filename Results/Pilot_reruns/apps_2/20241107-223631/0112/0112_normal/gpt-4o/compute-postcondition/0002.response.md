According to the code, the loop can execute if the `digits` list is not empty. In order for the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one digit. Before the loop starts, the `num` is a positive integer ensures that there are digits to iterate over, but it is important to adjust the state so that `digits` is not empty and `digit` is the first digit in the list. 
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of num with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with a length of n, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
