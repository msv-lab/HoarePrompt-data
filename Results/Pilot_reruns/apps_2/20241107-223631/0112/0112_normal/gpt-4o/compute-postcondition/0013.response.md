Postcondition: ***`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, `i+1` are in the given states. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged.***
