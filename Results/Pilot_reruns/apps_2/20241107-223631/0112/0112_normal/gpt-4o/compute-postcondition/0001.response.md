Example Answer:
All cubes are initially unused, so `used_cubes` is initialized as a list of `False` values with a length of `n`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, digits is a list containing the individual digits of num, used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n**
