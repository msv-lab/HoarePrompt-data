# Initial Assessment:
The given Python program consists of two functions. The first function (`func_1`) iterates over numbers starting from 1 and checks if each number can be formed using the cubes provided. The second function (`can_form_number`) checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces provided. The program aims to find the maximum number `x` such that Masha can make any integers from 1 to `x` using her cubes.

# Edge Cases to Consider:
1. What if Masha receives only one cube?
2. What if all the cubes have the same digit on all faces?
3. What if all the cubes have different digits on all faces?

# Checking with Output Hints:
The output hints describe the functionality of both functions and the overall purpose of the program. The hints explain that the program iterates over numbers to find the maximum number that can be formed using the cube faces provided. The `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces. The hints seem to match the code logic.

# Final Assessment:
The program seems to correctly implement the problem description and the logic provided in the output hints. It ensures that Masha can build all numbers from 1 to `x` using her cubes. The code handles the rotation of cubes and checks if a number can be formed using the given cube faces. 

Correctness: **True**.
