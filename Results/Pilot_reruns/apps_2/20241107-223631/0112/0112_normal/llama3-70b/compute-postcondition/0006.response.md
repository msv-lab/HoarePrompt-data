Example Answer:
The code iterates over each cube in the list `cubes`, converts each digit in the cube to a string, and updates the set `digits` with unique digits from all cubes. Since `digits` is a set containing unique digits, after the execution of the code, `digits` will be updated with all unique digits from all cubes. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes**
