Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9**
