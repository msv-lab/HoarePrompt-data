Example Answer:
The code removes the digit '0' from the set digits. The set digits may or may not have contained '0' before the removal. Therefore, the Output State is: If cubes is an empty list, digits is an empty set. If cubes has at least one cube, digits will contain all unique digits from all cubes after removing '0'.
Output State: **If cubes is an empty list, digits is an empty set. If cubes has at least one cube, digits will contain all unique digits from all cubes after removing '0'**
