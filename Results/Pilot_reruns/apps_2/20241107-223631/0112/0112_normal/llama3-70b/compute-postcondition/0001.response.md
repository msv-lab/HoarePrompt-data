Example Answer:
The code reads input for `n` representing the number of cubes. For each cube, it reads 6 integers and creates a list of 6 integers for each cube. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for the cubes, the output state will be: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9**
