Postcondition: ***If cubes is an empty list, digits remains an empty set. If cubes has at least one cube, digits will contain all unique digits from all cubes after removing '0'. The loop doesn't execute if cubes is empty, ensuring digits stays empty. If cubes has cubes with digits other than '0', those unique digits are added to digits, resulting in a set containing all unique non-zero digits from all cubes.***
