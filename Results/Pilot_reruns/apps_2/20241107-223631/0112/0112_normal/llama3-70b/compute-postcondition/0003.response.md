According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. We need to ensure that n is a positive integer and there is at least 1 cube in the cubes list. Additionally, as digits is an empty set, it does not affect the loop execution.
State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube**
