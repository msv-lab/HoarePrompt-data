Example Answer:
The code iterates through each cube in the list `cubes`, converts each digit in the cube to a string, and updates the `digits` set with unique digits from all cubes. Since `digits` is a set containing unique digits, the set will be updated with new unique digits from each cube. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes**
