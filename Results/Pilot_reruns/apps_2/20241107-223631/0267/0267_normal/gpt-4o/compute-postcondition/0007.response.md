According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`, and the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r + 1`. To execute one more time, `num` should be less than or equal to `r`. This means we need to adjust `num` to be less than or equal to `r - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and applying modulo `MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `num` is equal to `r - 1`**
