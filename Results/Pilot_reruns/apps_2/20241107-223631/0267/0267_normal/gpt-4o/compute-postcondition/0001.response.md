According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. If the range has at least one number, the loop will execute. Hence, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
