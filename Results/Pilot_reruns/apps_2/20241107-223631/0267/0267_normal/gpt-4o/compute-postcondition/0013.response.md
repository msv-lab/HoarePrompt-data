The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function calculates a `total_sum` which is an integer. The loop iterates from `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true for any `num` in the range, `total_sum` is updated by adding that particular `num` and applying modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` always returns false for the entire range, `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns the final value of `total_sum`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, iterate through the range from `l` to `r`, update `total_sum` based on the output of `func_1(num, k)`, and return the final value of `total_sum`.
