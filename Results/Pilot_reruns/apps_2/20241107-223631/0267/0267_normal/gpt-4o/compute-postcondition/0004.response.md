At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `r`. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to `r + 1` as the loop iterates until `r + 1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `r + 1**
