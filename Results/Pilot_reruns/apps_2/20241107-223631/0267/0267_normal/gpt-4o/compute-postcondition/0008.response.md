Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. Here, `num` is equal to `r - 1`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `total_sum` is `(total_sum + (r - 1)) % MOD`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r - 1)) % MOD`**
