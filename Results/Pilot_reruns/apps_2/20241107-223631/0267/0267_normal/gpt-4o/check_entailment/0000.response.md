Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to solve the given problem.
- `func_1` checks if the number of unique characters in the string representation of a number `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `func_2` iterates through the inclusive range from `l` to `r`, checks the output of `func_1(num, k)` for each number in the range, and updates the `total_sum` accordingly by adding the particular number and applying modulo `MOD`.
- The code handles the input constraints specified in the problem description.
- The output hints provided also align with the code's functionality and do not introduce any conflicting cases.
- The code correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits and prints the result modulo `998244353`.
- Based on the code logic and the provided examples, the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and therefore the correctness is **True**.
