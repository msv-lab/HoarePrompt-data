Example Answer: 
`dp[n, k]` is incremented by `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are given, but the value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values**
