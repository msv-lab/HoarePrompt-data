Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, and `i` is 1. The output state after execution is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the provided expression.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the provided expression**
