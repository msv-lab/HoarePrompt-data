According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to k-1, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the initial state already satisfies the loop condition. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values**
