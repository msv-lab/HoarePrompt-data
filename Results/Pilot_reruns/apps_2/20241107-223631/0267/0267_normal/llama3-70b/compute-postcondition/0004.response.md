Example Answer: 
The key (n, k) is assigned the value of n. The function does not return anything since there are no return statements in the code provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values**
