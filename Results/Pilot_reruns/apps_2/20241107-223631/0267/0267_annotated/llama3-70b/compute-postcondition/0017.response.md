Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store already computed values. If `(n, k)` is already a key in `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value stored in `dp`. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n < 10, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`**
