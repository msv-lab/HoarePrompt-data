Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value. The values of `n` and `k` are non-negative integers, `i` is 2, and the dictionary `dp` contains updated values. After executing the code, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 2, and the updated value of dp[n, k].
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 2, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
