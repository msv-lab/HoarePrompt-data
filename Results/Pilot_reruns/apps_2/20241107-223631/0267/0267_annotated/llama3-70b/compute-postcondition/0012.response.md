According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is a positive integer. This means the loop can execute one more time. The only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to run again.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 4, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
