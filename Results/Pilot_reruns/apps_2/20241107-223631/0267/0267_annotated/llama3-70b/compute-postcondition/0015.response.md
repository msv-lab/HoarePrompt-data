Example Answer:
Since dp[n, k] is updated to the calculated value, dp[n, k] %= MOD will update the value of dp[n, k] based on the modulo operation with MOD. The values of n and k remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation with MOD, n and k remain unchanged, and i is the final value of the loop iteration.
Output State: **dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation with MOD, n and k remain unchanged, and i is the final value of the loop iteration.**
