Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store already computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value stored in dp. If k is 0, the function returns 0. If n < 10 ** k, then dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated through multiple calculations involving a loop iteration over i, ultimately resulting in a final value stored in dp[n, k] after the modulo operation with MOD. The variables n and k remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
