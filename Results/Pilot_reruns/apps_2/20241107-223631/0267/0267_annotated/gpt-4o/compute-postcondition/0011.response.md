Output State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If the loop executes, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of all numbers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` within the range [l, r], with each sum operation being taken modulo `MOD`. `l` and `r` are updated based on the loop iteration, and `num` is updated for each iteration. If the loop does not execute (e.g., when `l` is greater than `r`), there are no changes to `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, or `num`.**
