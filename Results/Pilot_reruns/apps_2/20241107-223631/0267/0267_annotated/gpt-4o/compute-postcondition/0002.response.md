Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_sum` is updated accordingly. The states of `l` and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated based on the previous value and `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the previous value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
