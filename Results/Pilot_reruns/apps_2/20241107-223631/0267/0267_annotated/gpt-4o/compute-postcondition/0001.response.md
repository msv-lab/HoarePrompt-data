According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` starts at the value of `l`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
