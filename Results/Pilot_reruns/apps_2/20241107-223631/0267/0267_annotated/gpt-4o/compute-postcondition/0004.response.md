According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next number after the current `num`, and if `num` reaches `r`, then `l` also needs to be updated to the next number after the current `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next number after the current `num` if `num` is less than `r`, otherwise `l` is updated to the next number after the current `l` and `num` is set to the new `l`.**
