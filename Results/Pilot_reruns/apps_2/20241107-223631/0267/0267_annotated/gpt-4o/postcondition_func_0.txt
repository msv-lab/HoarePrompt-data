The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k. It checks if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k and returns a boolean value accordingly. The function assumes n is an integer greater than 0 and k is a positive integer. It does not handle cases where n is not a positive integer or k is not a positive integer.
