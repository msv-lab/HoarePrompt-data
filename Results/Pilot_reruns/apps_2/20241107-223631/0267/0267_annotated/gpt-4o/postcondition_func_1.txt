The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through the range [l, r] (inclusive), calculates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, and then takes the sum modulo `MOD`. The function updates `l` and `r` based on the loop iteration, but `num` is not directly involved in the final result. If the loop does not execute (when `l` is greater than `r`), `total_sum` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality is to compute the sum of numbers within the range [l, r] that fulfill the condition `func_1(num, k)` and return the result modulo `MOD`.
