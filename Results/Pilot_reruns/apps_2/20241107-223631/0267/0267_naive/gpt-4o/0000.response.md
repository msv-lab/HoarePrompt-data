Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number contains at most `k` different digits. 
2. The program then iterates through all numbers in the range from `l` to `r`, calculates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits, and takes the modulo `998244353`.
3. The program successfully handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring the correctness of the final output.
