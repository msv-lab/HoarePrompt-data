Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in a given range. The logic implemented in the program is consistent with the problem description, and for all the provided examples, the program produces the correct output. Additionally, the program handles the constraints specified in the problem description (`1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10`) and correctly applies the modulo operation. Therefore, based on the examples and the logic provided, the program can be considered correct.
