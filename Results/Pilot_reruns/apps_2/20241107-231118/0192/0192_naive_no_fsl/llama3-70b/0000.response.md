Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. This is achieved by simply taking the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to modify the sides of the triangle. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the examples provided also demonstrate the correct functionality of the code.
