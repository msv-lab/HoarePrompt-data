Example Answer:
`color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range from 1 to m, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color after mapping the input, and color_counts is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of Jedi Knights, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color after mapping the input, and color_counts is an empty dictionary**
