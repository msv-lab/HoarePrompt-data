Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 0.***
