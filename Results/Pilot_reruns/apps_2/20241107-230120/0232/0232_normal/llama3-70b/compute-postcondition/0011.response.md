Example Answer:
The code increments the count of lightsabers of a specific color by 1 in the color_counts dictionary. If the color is not already a key in color_counts, it is added with a value of 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+1 integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, color_counts is a dictionary with color as key and value where the count of lightsabers for a specific color has been updated.
