Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 1. After the execution of the if statement, if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts` (after sorting `window_counts` values), the variable `found` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
