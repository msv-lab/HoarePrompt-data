Example Answer:
`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is assigned a value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` assigned a value of 0.
Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` assigned a value of 0**
