Example Answer:
The count of the specified color in `color_counts` is incremented by 1. If the color is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+2 integers, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary with updated counts for each color.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+2 integers, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary with updated counts for each color**
