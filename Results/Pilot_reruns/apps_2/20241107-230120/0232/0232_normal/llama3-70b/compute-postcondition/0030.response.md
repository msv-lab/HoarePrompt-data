Example Answer:
`color` is assigned the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. The value of `j` is equal to `i+1`, so `color` is the color following the color at index `i`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 0. All other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 0.**
