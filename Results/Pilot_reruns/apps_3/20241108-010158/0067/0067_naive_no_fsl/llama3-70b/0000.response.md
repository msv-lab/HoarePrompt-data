Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if there are more upvotes than downvotes, then prints "+", if there are more downvotes than upvotes, then prints "-", if they are equal and there are no unknown votes, then prints "0", and if there are unknown votes, then prints "?". The logic covers all possibilities as described in the problem statement.
