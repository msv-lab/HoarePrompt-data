Example Answer: 
`x, y, z` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. The `input().split()` accepts input separated by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts each input to an integer, and `x, y, z` are assigned these integer values. Since the input values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state is: `x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
