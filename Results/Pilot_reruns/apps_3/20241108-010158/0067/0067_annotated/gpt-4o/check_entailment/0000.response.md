Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes three non-negative integers x, y, z as input which represent the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or unknown votes respectively. It then calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes possible based on the input values. 

If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints "-", indicating that there will be more downvotes. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints "+", indicating that there will be more upvotes. If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "?", indicating uncertainty.

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as described in the problem statement's examples.
