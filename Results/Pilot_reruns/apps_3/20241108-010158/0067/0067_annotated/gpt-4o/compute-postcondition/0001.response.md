Example Answer: 
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer. The value of `x` can be between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`**
