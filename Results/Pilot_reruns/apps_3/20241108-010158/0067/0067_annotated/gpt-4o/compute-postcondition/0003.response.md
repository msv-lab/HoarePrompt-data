Example Answer: 
`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
