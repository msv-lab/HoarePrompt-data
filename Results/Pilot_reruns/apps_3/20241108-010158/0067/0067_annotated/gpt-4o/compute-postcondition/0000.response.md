Example Answer:
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned using the `map(int, input().split())` function which takes input and splits it into integers. Since the values are non-negative integers and within the range of 0 to 100, the output state is:
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
