Example Answer: 
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`, where `y` is the minimum downvotes and `z` is a non-negative integer. The previous values of `y` and `z` are known, so the sum is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
