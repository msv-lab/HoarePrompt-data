Functionality: **The function accepts three non-negative integers x, y, z as input parameters, calculates the sum of x and z, and determines the relationship between the sums of upvotes and downvotes. If the sum of upvotes is less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the sum of downvotes is less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'.**
