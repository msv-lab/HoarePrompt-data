Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the program prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the program prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the program prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, the program prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints '?'. The initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain as non-negative integers between 0 and 100 after the execution of the program fragment.***
