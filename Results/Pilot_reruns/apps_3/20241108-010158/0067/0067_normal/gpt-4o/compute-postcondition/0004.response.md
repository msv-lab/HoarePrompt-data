Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`, where `y` is the previous value of `min_downvotes` and `z` is the previous value of `z`. Since `min_downvotes` is `y` and `z`, are between 0 and 100, `max_downvotes` will be between 0 and 200. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is between 0 and 200.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is between 0 and 200**
