Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can be any integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input**
