Example Answer:
`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, where `y` is an integer between 0 and 100. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`**
