Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` and `z` are integers between 0 and 100. The value of `min_upvotes` is already assigned the value of `x`. After execution, `max_upvotes` will be the sum of `x` and `z`, which will also be between 0 and 200. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` and is between 0 and 200**
