The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value but prints all possible combinations of x, y, and z where x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function simply generates and prints all valid combinations of x, y, and z within the specified range. 
Functionality: **The function generates and prints all possible combinations of x, y, and z where x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.**
