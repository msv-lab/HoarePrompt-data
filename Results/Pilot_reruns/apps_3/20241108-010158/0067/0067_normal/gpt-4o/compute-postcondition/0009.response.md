Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, within the range of 0 to 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is between 0 and 200. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
