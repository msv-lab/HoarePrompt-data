Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, and `candidate` is unknown. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns True, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
