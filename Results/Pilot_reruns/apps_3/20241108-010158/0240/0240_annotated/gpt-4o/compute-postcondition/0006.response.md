Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`. No information is provided about the values of `chars`, `sub`, or `perm`. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
