Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n. The loop generates permutations of `chars` and joins them to create `candidate`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns True, then the loop yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no action is taken.**
