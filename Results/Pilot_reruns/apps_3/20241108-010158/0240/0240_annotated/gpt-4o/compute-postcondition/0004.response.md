According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`. The state of `candidate` is unknown. To execute the loop one more time, the `chars` string must have more permutations available.
State: **`chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is unknown**
