Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes a string and a substring as input to reconstruct the smallest possible initial integer n.
2. It considers all possible permutations of the remaining characters after removing the substring from the string.
3. It then checks if the generated number is a valid number by verifying if the substring is present in the number and the number of digits matches the expected length.
4. Finally, it returns the smallest valid number that can be constructed.

The code logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, ensuring that the smallest possible initial integer n is reconstructed accurately.
