Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to `n`. The previous values of `n` and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is incremented by the value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is incremented by the value of `c`**
