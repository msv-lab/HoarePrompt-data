Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of characters in string `t`. The values of `s` and `t` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing characters of t.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing characters of t**
