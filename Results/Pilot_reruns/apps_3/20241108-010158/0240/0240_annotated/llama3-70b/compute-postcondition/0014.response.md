Example Answer:
The function returns the integer value of `n`, which is a string containing the concatenation of characters that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t`. If no characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` is an empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `n` is a string containing the concatenation of characters that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t`. If no characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `n` is a string containing the concatenation of characters that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t`. If no characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` is an empty string**
