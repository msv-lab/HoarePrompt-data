According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `s` and the substring `t`. If there are more characters in `s` to iterate over, the loop will continue. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated by concatenating `c` to the previous value of `n`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains the same.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be considered. 

If `c` is the last character in `s`, then the loop will not execute again. If `c` is not the last character in `s`, the loop will continue.

State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`.**
