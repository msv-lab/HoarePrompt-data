Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string. This does not affect the initial state variables. Therefore, the output state is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing characters of t.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing characters of t**
