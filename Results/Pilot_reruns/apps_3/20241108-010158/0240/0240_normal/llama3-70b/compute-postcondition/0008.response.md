According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`, as long as there are remaining characters to iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, `n` is updated by adding `c` to its end. Otherwise, there is no change to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` should still have remaining characters to iterate. If the next character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will be updated accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string**
