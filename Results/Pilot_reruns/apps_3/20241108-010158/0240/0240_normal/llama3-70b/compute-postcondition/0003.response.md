Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so the new value of `n` depends on the value of `c`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is updated based on the value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is updated based on the value of `c`**
