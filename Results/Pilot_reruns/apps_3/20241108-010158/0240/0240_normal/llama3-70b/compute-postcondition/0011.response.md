According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` which is a non-empty string. If there are remaining characters to iterate in `s`, the loop executes again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c` if `c` is in `t_set`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state to adjust is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with the next character in `s` if the next character is in `t_set**.
