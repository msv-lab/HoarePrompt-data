The function is_valid_number accepts three parameters: num_str (a string representing a very large integer), sub (a substring of num_str), and n_len (the length of num_str). It returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len; otherwise, it returns False. However, the code does not handle the case where sub is not in num_str. This missing functionality could potentially lead to incorrect results.
