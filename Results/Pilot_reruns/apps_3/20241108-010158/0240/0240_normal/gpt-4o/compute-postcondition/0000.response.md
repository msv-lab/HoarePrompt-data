According to the code, the loop can execute if `chars` is not empty and `sub` is a substring of the number represented by `chars`. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `chars` should not be an empty string and `sub` should be a substring of the number represented by `chars`.
State: **Precondition**: **chars is a string representing a number (not empty), sub is a string representing a substring of the number n**.
