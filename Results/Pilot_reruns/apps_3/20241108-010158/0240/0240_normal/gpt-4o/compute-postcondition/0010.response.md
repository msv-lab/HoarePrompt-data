Example Answer: 
The code yields the `candidate` string. The `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list, and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True. The `perm` list is adjusted with more elements during the execution. Since the output state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `perm` or the specific elements that were added, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True; `perm` list is adjusted with more elements**
