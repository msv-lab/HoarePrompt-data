Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list. The function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, and `perm` list is adjusted with more elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, `perm` list is adjusted with more elements.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, `perm` list is adjusted with more elements**
