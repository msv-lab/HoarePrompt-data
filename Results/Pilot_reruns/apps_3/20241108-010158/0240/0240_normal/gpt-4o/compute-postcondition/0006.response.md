Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns the `candidate` string. The `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list, and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True. Therefore, the `candidate` string is yielded. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True**
