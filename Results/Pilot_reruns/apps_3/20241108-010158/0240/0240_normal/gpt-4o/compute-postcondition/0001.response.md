Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the concatenated string of the elements in the `perm` list. The value of `perm` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list**
