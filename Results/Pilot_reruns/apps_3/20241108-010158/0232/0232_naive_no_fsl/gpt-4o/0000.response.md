Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of the number of Jedi Knights, the colors of their lightsabers, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color.
2. The program then iterates through the list of Jedi Knights' colors and keeps track of the current counts of each color in a defaultdict.
3. It uses a sliding window approach to check if there is a contiguous interval where the desired counts of each color are met.
4. If such an interval is found, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.
5. The program handles all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
