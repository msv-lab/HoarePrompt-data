Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved within that interval. If such an interval is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if `found` is True, otherwise it prints "NO". 

The logic of the program seems to be correct and it follows the problem description for every potential case.
