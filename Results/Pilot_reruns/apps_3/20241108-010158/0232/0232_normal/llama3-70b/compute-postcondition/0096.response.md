Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The dictionary `window_counts` has `color` as the key, and its value is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, with `color` being the new color value from `colors[j]`. `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than `i + 1. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, its value is set to 1. This encompasses all possible scenarios when the if statement is executed.***
