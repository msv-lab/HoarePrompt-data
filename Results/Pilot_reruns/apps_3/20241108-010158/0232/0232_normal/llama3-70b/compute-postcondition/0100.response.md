Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is updated such that if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with the value 0, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, and `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`. All the initial conditions are maintained after the execution of the if statement, ensuring that the key `color` exists in `window_counts` with a value of 0 if it was not present before.***
