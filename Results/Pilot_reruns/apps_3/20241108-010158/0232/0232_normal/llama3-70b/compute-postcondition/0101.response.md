Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is updated such that if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with the value 0, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, and `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j] after `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
