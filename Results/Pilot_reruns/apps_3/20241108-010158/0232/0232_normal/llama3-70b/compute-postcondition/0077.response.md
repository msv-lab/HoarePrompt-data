Output State: **If `n` is 0 or `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. In this case, `found` remains False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` remains the same, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains the same, and `n` remains the same. If the loop executes, `found` is True if all the counts in `window_counts` match the counts in `counts`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for each color, `color` is the last color in the list, `colors` is a list of `n` integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of `n` Jedi Knights (unchanged), `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input (unchanged), `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value (unchanged), `i` is the index at which the loop stopped, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1**.
