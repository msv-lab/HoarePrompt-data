Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, color is the color at index j+2 in the list, counts is a list of integers obtained from the input, color_counts is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, found is True, n is greater than 1, i is 1, window_counts is a dictionary with updated count of colors including the new color, window_counts[color] is incremented by 1. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is assigned as 0. If all the counts of colors in window_counts match the corresponding counts in the input list 'counts', the variable 'found' is set to True and the loop is terminated. This ensures that the program checks if the number of occurrences of each color in the window_counts dictionary matches the target counts provided in the input list.***
