Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `color` is the third color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` is updated with the third color having a count of 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `color_counts`.***
