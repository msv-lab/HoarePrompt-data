Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color_counts[color]` depends on whether `color` was already in `color_counts` or not. If it was already in `color_counts`, then the count of the third color is increased by 1. If it was not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` is updated with the third color having a count of 0 and then incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `color` is the third color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `color_counts` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `color` is the third color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `color_counts` is updated accordingly**
