According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is False, n is greater than 0, i is 0**
