Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting, `found` is set to True, and `window_counts` remains the dictionary with `color` as the key and the value incremented by 1. `color` is the new color value, `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1. If the color is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
