Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` contains updated counts for each color, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, and `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j] after `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited.***
