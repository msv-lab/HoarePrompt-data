Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized as False. The loop does not execute if `colors` is an empty list, so `found` remains False. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, and `found` is False.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, and `found` is False**
