Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not present as a key in `color_counts`, it will be updated to include `color` as a key with a value of 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of at least 1 integer, `color` is the first color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of at least 1 integer, `color` is the first color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` has been updated accordingly**
