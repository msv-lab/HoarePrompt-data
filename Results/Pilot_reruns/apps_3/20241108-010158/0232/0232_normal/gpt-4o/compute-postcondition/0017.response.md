According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, no adjustments were needed, so the program state remains unchanged with the last updated values. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed, the program state remains unchanged with the last updated values**
