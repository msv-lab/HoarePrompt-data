Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not require any adjustments and remains unchanged, the same values can be used to start the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No adjustments needed, the program state remains unchanged with the last updated values**
