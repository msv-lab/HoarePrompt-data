Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, `k` is a list of m integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts where at least one color count is less than the desired count, `left` is 0, `right` is 1. If all color counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts specified in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
