Example Answer: 
The function returns 'YES' if at least one color has a count in current_counts less than the desired count. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: For at least one color, the count in current_counts is less than the desired count.
Output State: **For at least one color, the count in current_counts is less than the desired count**
