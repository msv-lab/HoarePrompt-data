According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the equality of counts of colors in `desired_counts` and `current_counts`. If all colors have equal counts, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed until `right` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition of counts of colors being equal needs to be maintained. Thus, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop continues executing until `right` is less than `n`.
State: **`current_counts` and `desired_counts` have equal counts for all colors, `right` is less than `n**`.
