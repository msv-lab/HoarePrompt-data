Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop stops when at least one color has a count less than the desired count. The values of `current_counts` and `left` are updated accordingly based on the loop iterations. If the loop doesn't start due to initial conditions where at least one color already has a count less than the desired count, the function won't enter the loop and will not return 'YES'.**
