The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. 

**Precondition**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. `k` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ Σ(k_i) ≤ n.

In Case_1, if the initial state does not satisfy the condition where at least one color has a count less than the desired count, the loop does not execute, and `current_counts` and `left` remain unchanged. If the loop does execute, then after its execution, the function will return 'YES' if all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal in `current_counts`. Otherwise, the loop will stop when at least one color has a count less than the desired count, and `current_counts` and `left` will be updated accordingly based on the loop iterations. If the loop executes multiple times, `current_counts` and `desired_counts` will have equal counts for all colors except the color at index `right` which will have one extra count. Additionally, `right` will be less than `n`.

In Case_2, if the initial state does not satisfy the condition where at least one color has a count less than the desired count, the loop does not execute, and `current_counts` and `left` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n` and `m`, a list of integers `colors`, and a list of integers `k`. The function iterates through the colors and checks if each color has the desired count. If all colors have the desired count after the iteration, it returns 'YES'. If at least one color has a count less than the desired count, the function stops and updates the necessary counts.
