Example Answer:
The count of the color at the index `right` in `colors` is incremented by 1 in `current_counts`. The counts of all colors were equal before, and `right` is less than `n`. After execution, the count of the color at index `right` in `current_counts` will be one more than the count in `desired_counts`, while the counts of other colors remain the same.
Output State: **`current_counts` and `desired_counts` have equal counts for all colors except the color at index `right` which has one extra count, `right` is less than `n**
