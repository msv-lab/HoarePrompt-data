Example Answer:
The function returns 'YES', and the `current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The return statement does not change the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1 and the function returns 'YES'.
Output State: **`current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1 and the function returns 'YES'**
