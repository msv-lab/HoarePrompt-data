Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks. The `window_counts` dictionary is empty, `found` is not defined, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j] before breaking out of the loop or if statement. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is not defined.***
