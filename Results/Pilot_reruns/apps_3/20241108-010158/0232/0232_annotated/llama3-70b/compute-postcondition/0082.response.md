Example Answer:
`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is already equal to `i`. The value of `i` is less than `n`, but the values of `window_counts` and `found` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is not defined, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]`.
Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is not defined, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]**
