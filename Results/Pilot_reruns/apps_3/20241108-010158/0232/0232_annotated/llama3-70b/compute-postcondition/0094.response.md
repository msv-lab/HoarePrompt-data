Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary with updated count for the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]`.
Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with updated count for the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]`**
