Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color encountered in the loop, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j] before breaking out of the loop or if statement. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is not defined.**
