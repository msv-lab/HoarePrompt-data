Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. After the execution of the program fragment, if all the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`, and `color` maintain their initial conditions. If the condition is not met, the program continues without changing the variables.***
