Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with updated count for the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `j` is less than `n`, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
