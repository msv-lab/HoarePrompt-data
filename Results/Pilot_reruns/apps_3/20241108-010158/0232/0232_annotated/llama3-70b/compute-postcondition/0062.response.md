Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `color` is either incremented by 1 or set to 0 if `color` was not a key in `window_counts`. `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, if `color` was not a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1. If all values in the sorted `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list, then `found` is set to True. This covers all possible edge cases and scenarios after the if statement executes.***
