Example Answer:
The list `colors` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces. The length of `colors` will be equal to the number of Jedi Knights (`n`). The previous values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
