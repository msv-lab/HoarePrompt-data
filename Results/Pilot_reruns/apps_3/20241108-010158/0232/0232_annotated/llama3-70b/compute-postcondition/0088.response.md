Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with an incremented value of 1. `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j] before breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
