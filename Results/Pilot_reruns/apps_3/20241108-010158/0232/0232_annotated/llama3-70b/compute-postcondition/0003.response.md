Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the count of each color of lightsabers. As this initialization does not affect the existing variables, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
