Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `color` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `color` was not a key before. `j` ranges from `i` to `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was not a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1. If all values in the sorted `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list, then `found` is set to True after the execution of the if block. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute. After the if block, the program state remains consistent with the preconditions, ensuring the integrity of the `window_counts` dictionary and the value of `found` based on the conditions met during the execution of the code.***
