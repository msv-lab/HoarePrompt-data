Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with updated count for the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `j` is less than `n`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.***
