Postcondition: ***If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute. If the loop does execute, `found` is a boolean indicating whether the condition `all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))` is met. `n` remains a positive integer, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is equal to the current iteration value, `window_counts` is a dictionary with keys representing colors and corresponding values indicating the frequency of each color, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `found` is true, the loop or the if statement is exited, ensuring the overall state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial conditions.***
