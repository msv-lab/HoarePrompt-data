Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where if `color` is not already a key, it is added with a value of 0. `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is already a key in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary.***
