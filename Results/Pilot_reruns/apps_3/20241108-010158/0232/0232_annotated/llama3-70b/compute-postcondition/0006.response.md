Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of at least `n` integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `color_counts` is a dictionary. If the color is not already in `color_counts`, a new key `color` is added with the value 0. This ensures that `color_counts` includes all possible colors with an initial count of 0, ready to be updated based on the colors of the Jedi Knights.***
