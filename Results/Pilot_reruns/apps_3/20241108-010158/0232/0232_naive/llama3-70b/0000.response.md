Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, creates a dictionary to store the count of each color in the given list of colors, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if the counts of each color in that interval match the desired counts provided. If such an interval is found, it sets the flag `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints 'YES' if a valid interval is found, and 'NO' otherwise. 
The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as required by the problem description.
