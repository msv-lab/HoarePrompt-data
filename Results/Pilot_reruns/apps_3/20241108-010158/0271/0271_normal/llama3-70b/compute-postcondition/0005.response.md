Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n with its last digit removed. If the last digit of n is greater than 5, the program prints the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to n.***
