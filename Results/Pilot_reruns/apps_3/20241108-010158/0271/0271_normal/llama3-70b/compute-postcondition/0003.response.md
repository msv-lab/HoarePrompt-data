Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is added to (10 - n % 10). Since n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result of this calculation will always be the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`**
