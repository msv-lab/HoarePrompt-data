Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, `result` is a non-negative integer. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is equal to the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is equal to the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`.***
