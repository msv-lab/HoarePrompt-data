Example Answer: 
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, the result can be any non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, `result` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, `result` is a non-negative integer**
