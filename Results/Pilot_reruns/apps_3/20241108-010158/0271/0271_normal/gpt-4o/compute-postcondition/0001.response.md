Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the possible values of `remainder` can range from 0 to 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9**
