Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Then, based on the value of the remainder, it computes a result value. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the code correctly calculates the result by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, the code again correctly calculates the result by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly rounds the input `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0.
