Example Answer:
The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which means it subtracts the remainder of the division of `n` by 10 from `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the result will always be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result is a multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result is a multiple of 10**
