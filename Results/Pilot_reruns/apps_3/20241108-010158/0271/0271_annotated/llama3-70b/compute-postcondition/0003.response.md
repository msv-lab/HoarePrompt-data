Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is added to the difference between 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result will always be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is always a multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is always a multiple of 10**
