Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n minus n % 10, which is always a multiple of 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the program prints n plus (10 minus n % 10), which is also always a multiple of 10. The program handles all possible edge cases within the given range of n, ensuring that the output is always a multiple of 10.***
