Example Answer:
The value of result depends on the value of the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is n - remainder. If the remainder is greater than 5, the result is n + (10 - remainder). The output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the result being printed.
Output State: **n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is obtained by subtracting the remainder from n. If the remainder is greater than 5, the result is obtained by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to n. The result is printed.**
