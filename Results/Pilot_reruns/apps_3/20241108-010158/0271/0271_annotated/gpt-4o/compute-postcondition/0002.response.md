Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `remainder` is the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the value of `result` depends on the specific value of `n` and its last digit. The output state is: n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n, result is the difference between n and its last digit.
Output State: **n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n, result is the difference between n and its last digit**
