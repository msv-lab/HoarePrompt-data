Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is calculated by adding `n` and `(10 - remainder)`. Since `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, the value of `result` will be `n` plus 10 minus the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n, result is the sum of n and 10 minus the last digit of n.
Output State: **n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n, result is the sum of n and 10 minus the last digit of n**
