The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, calculates the last digit of `n`, and based on the value of the last digit, either subtracts it from `n` if it's less than or equal to 5, or adds the difference between 10 and the last digit to `n` if it's greater than 5. The resulting value is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
