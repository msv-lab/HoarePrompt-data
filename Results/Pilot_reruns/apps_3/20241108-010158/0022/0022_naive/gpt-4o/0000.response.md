Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if the given string is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing it with the mirror reflection of the second half. If at any point, the characters do not match, it returns False, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True. The program follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases, ensuring the correctness of the solution.
