Output State: 
- `s` is the input string provided
- `n` is the length of `s` and at least 2
- `is_spalindrome` is either True or False based on the comparison of characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1`
- `i` is the index of the characters being compared in each iteration of the loop
- If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated
- If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than 2), `is_spalindrome` remains True
- The loop checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string.
