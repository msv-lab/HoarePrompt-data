Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string provided, `n` is the length of `s` and at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This covers the scenario where the input string is not a palindrome.***
