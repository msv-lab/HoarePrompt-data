The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If the characters at symmetric positions are equal, it returns True. If any pair of characters at symmetric positions are not equal, it returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function returns True.
