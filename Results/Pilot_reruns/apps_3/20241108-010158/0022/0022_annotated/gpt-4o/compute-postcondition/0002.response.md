Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, and the function returns `False`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, and the function returns `False`**
