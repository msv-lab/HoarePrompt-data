According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2` by incrementing it by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1**
