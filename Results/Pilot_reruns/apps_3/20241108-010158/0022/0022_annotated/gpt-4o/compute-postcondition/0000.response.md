Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000 based on the length of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`**
