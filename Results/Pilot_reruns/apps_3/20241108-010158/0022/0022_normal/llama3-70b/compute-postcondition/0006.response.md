Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If there exists a character at index `i` in `s` such that it does not match the character at the corresponding index from the end, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `is_spalindrome` remains True.***
