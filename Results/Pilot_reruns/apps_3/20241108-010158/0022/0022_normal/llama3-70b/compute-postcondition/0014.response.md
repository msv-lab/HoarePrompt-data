Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is less than `n // 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This condition covers the scenario where the characters at symmetrical positions within the string `s` do not match, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome.***
