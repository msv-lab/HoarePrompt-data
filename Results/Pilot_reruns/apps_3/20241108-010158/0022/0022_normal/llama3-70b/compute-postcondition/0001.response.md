Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` will have a value between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`**
