Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function func_1 accepts a string parameter `s` and checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at corresponding positions from the start and end of the string. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function does not execute the loop and also returns False. This logic is in line with the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for all scenarios.
