The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Additionally, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are provided. 

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate the `time_to_target_floor` based on the formula `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, then calculate the `total_time` as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and finally return the `total_time`.
