Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Based on the problem description and the annotations in the code, the program accurately calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment, walk to the target block, and reach the target floor, considering all the time constraints mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the `get_location` function correctly determines the block and floor of a given apartment number. 

The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, such as moving between blocks, moving between floors, using the elevator, and walking within the building. All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem requirements for all possible scenarios, leading to the correctness of the program.
