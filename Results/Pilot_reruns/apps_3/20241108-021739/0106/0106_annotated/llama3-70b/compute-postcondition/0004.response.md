Example Answer: 
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `b` is an input integer, and `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the value of `b_floor` will be between 1 and `m` based on the formula provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a calculated integer based on the formula given; `b_floor` is a value between 1 and `m`**
