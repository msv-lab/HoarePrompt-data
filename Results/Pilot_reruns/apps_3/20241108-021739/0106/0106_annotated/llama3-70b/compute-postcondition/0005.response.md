Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated using the formula provided. The value of `b` is subtracted by 1, then divided by the product of `m` and `k`, then added 1. Since all variables are positive integers and within the specified range, the value of `b_block` will also be a positive integer between 1 and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a calculated integer based on the formula given; `b_floor` is a value between 1 and `m`; `b_block` is a positive integer between 1 and `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a calculated integer based on the formula given; `b_floor` is a value between 1 and `m`; `b_block` is a positive integer between 1 and `m`**
