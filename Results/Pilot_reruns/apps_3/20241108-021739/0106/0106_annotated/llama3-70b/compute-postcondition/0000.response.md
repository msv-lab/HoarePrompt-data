Example Answer:
n, m, and k are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The values of n, m, and k are positive integers, so they will take on those positive integer values from the input. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000.
Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000**
