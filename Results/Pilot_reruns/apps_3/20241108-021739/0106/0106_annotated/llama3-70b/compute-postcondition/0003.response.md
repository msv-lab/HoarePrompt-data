Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, so their values can vary. The value of `a_floor` is not used in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a calculated integer based on the formula given.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a calculated integer based on the formula given**
