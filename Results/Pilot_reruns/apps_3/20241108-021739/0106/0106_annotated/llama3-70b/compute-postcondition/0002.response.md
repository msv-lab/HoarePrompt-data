Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `a_floor` are affected, where `a` and `m` are input integers. Since `a` and `m` are input integers, the value of `a_floor` will be between 1 and `m` based on the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is a calculated integer between 1 and `m`**
