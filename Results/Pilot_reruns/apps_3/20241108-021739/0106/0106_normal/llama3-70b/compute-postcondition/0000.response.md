Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are restricted to be between 1 and 1000. The other variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.
Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k**
