Example Answer: 
`a_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. 
`min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` or `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15.
The output state is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated based on the given formula.
