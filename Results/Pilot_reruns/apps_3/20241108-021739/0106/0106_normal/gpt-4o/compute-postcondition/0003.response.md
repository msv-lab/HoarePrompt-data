Example Answer:
The function returns `block` and `floor`. The value of `block` is calculated based on a formula, and the value of `floor` is updated accordingly. Since the specific values of `block` and `floor` are not provided in the initial state, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on a formula, `floor` is updated accordingly**
