Output State: **`block_a` and `floor_a` remain the same, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the block and floor locations of position `b`, `time_to_exit` is either initialized to 0 if `floor_a` is equal to 1, or calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a - 1` otherwise, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15, `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5**
