The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function body, `block_a` and `floor_a` remain the same. `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the block and floor locations of position `b`. `time_to_exit` is initialized to 0 if `floor_a` is equal to 1, or calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a - 1` otherwise. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5. `total_time` is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The function returns `total_time`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, b and calculates the total time to reach the target floor from the starting floor based on the given block and floor locations, considering different walk times and exit times.**
