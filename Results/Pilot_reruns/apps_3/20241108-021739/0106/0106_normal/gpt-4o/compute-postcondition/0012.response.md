Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts parameters n, m, k, a, b representing block and floor locations, calculates the total time to reach the target floor from the starting floor. It considers different walk times and exit times based on the given locations. The function calculates `time_to_exit` based on the floor of position a, determines `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on block locations, finds the minimum walk time, calculates `time_to_target_floor`, and then computes the total time as the sum of all these components. The function returns the total time to reach the target floor.**
