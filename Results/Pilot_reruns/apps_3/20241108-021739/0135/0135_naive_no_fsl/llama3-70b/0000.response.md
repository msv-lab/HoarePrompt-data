Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks if all the remainders are distinct and prints "No" if a duplicate remainder is found, otherwise it prints "Yes". The program iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if the remainder is already in a set. If it is, then it prints "No" and exits, otherwise it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, if no duplicate remainders are found, it prints "Yes". The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
