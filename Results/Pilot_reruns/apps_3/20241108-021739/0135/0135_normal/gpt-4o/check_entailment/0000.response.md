Correctness: **True**

Upon initial assessment, the code appears to be following the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters `n` and `k`, ensuring that `k` is less than `n` and within the given constraints. The function then checks if all the remainders from `n % i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k` are distinct by adding them to a set and returning 'Yes' if they are distinct and 'No' if any remainder is repeated.

The output hints also confirm that the code is implementing the logic described in the problem statement. It states that the function returns 'Yes' if all the remainders are distinct and 'No' otherwise, which aligns with the code's functionality.

Since the program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the code is **True**.
