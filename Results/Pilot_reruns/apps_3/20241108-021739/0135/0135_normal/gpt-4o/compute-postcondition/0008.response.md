Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the result of `n % i`, where `n` is greater than `k` and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, the remainder will be 1 if `n` is an odd number and 0 if `n` is an even number. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 1 or 0**
