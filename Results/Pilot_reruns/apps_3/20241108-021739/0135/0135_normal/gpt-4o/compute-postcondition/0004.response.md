Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. Since `n` is greater than `k` and `k` is at least 1, the remainder is the result of the modulo operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
