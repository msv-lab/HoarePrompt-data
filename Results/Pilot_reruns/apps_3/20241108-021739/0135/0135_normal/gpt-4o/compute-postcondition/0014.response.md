The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `n` > `k`. 

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. 

Case_2: If `k` is less than `n`, after the loop executes, the function returns information about the state of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, `i`, and `remainder` based on the conditions mentioned. 

Case_3: Similar to Case_2, if `k` is less than `n`, after the loop executes, the function returns information about the state of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, `i`, and `remainder` based on the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, provide different outputs as described in the cases.
