Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is in the set `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
