The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `n` > `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, after the loop executes, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is either an empty set or contains unique remainders from `n % i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`, `i` is the value the loop ended on, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i` for the last iteration. Therefore, the function checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and returns 'Yes' if certain conditions are met, otherwise it returns 'No'.
