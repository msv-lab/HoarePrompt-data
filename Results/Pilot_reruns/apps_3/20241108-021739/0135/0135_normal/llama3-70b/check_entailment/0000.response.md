Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates unique remainders from `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`, and adds these remainders to a set `seen`.
- It then checks if any remainder is already in `seen`. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases where the remainders need to be distinct.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it correctly determines if all the remainders are distinct. The explanation in the hints matches the code logic, and there are no additional edge cases mentioned that the code does not handle.
