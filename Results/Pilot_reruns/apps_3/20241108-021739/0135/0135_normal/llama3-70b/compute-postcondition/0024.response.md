Functionality: **The function `func` reads two input integers `n` and `k`, calculates unique remainders from `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`, adds these remainders to a set `seen`, and checks if any remainder is already in `seen`. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not have a return value.**
