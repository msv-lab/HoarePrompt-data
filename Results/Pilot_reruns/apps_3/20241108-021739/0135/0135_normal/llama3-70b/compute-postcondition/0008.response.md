According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
