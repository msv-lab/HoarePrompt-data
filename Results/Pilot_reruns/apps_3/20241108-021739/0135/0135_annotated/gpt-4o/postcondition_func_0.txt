The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k` where both are in the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 
If k is a positive number, the function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders`, iterates through values of `i` from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i as `remainder`. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. 
If there are no repeated remainders, the function returns 'Yes' after the loop completes.
Overall, the function checks for unique remainders when dividing n by integers from 1 to k and determines whether to return 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions.
