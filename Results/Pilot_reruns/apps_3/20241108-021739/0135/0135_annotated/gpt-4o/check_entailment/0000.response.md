Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. The code initializes a set to store the seen remainders and iterates through the range of 1 to `k`, checking if the current remainder is already in the set. If a repeated remainder is found, it returns "No", indicating that not all remainders are distinct. If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, it returns "Yes", indicating that all remainders are distinct. The code handles the edge case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n` by returning "No" in that scenario. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
