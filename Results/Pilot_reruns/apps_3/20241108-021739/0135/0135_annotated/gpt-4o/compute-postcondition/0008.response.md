Example Answer: 
The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, but the initial value of `n` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 2**
