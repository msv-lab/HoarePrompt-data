According to the code, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the value of `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 3**
