Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It then calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to k. If any remainder is repeated, the function prints 'No' and exits. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. The functionality of the function is to determine if there are repeated remainders when dividing `n` by numbers from 1 to k.**
