Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing remainders from 0 to k, `i` is between 1 and k, `remainder` is the current remainder being calculated. If the `remainder` is already present in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. `print('Yes')` is executed.**
