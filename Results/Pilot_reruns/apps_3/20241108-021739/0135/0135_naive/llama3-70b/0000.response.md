Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and exits early if a duplicate remainder is found. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description and handles all cases as expected.
