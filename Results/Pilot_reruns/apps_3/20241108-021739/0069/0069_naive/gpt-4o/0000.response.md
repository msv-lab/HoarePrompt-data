Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ for each test case. It correctly handles the cases where the balance is 0 and where the balance is non-zero. The program uses the correct logic to determine the number of prefixes with the desired balance by iterating through the prefix balances and counting the valid prefixes. The program also correctly handles cases where there may be an infinite number of prefixes and outputs -1 in such cases. Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
