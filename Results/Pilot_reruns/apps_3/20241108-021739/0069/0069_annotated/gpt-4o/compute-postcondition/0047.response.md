Example Answer:
The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at index `i - 1` of string `s`. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', then 1 is added to the previous balance, otherwise, 1 is subtracted. Given the initial state where `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 4, the updated value of `prefix_balances[4]` will depend on the specific values of `prefix_balances[3]` and the character at index 3 of string `s`. 
Output State: **`index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, and the updated value of `prefix_balances[4]` is determined based on the condition mentioned above.**
