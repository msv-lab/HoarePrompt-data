According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list having at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged, and the `results` list has at least one more element. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables remain unchanged, `results` list has at least one more element**
