Example Answer:
The value of `index` is increased by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: $T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list**
