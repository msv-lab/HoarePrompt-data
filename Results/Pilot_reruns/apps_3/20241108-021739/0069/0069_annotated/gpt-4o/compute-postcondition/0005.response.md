According to the code, the loop will execute $T$ times. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as $T$ is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `index` is irrelevant as it is not used in the loop. However, since `results` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted so that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute. 

State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element**
