Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the index of the element in the list. If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum. 
Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum**
