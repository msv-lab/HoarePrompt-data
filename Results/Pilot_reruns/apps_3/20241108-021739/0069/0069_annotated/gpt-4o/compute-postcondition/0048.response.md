According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 0. To execute one more time:
1. The value of `i` needs to be updated to 5.
2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 5, and the updated value of `prefix_balances[4]` is determined based on the condition mentioned above**
