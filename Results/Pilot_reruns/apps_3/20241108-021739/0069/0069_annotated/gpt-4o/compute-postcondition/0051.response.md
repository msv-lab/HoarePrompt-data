Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for `n` times. After the loop executes, `index` will be 3, `balance` will be calculated based on string `s`, `n` will be greater than 0, and `prefix_balances` will be updated according to the given condition. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `index` will remain 3, `balance` will be calculated based on string `s`, and `prefix_balances` will not be updated.**
