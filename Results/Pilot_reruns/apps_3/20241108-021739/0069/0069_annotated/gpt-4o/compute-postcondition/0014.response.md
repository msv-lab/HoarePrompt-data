According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, which means `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list, `balance` is an integer value, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value at index `i` of `s`, `i` is 5**
