According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 1. 
State: **If `T` is greater than 1, `index` is 6, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is the value at index 6 of `data` converted to an integer and is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is updated with a list of zeros of length (n + 1), `x` is the value at index 4 of `data` converted to an integer, `i` is 1**
