Example Answer:
`prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The value of `i` is 3, so `prefix_balances[3]` will be calculated based on the previous values. The value of `s` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `balance`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the code will execute with the given initial state.
Output State: **`index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
