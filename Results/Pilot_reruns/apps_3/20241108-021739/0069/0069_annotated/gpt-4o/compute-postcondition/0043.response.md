Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is created with a length of `n + 1` and initialized with zeros. The variables `index` and `balance` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string `s`.
Output State: **`index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string `s`**
