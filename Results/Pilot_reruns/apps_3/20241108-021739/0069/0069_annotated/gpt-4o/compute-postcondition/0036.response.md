Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the `s` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. If `balance` is equal to 0, the `results` list will have -1 appended if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise 0 will be appended. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is an integer representing the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet the conditions specified in the loop. `results` list contains the appended `count` value after the loop completes, covering all edge cases and possible scenarios.***
