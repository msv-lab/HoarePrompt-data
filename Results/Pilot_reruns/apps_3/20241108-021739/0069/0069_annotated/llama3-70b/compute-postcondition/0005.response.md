Example Answer:
`balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` represents the count of '0' in string `s` and `cnt1` represents the count of '1' in string `s`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not given, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
