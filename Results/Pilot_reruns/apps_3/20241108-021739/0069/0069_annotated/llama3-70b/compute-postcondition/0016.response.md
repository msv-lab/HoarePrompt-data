Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(n + 1)` will output the value of `n` incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the input integer `n` incremented by 1.
Output State: **T is a positive integer + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `s` is assigned an input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s`, and the program prints the input integer `n` incremented by 1**
