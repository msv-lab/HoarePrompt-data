Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where `map(int, input().split())` accepts input and splits it into integers. The variables `T` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers**
