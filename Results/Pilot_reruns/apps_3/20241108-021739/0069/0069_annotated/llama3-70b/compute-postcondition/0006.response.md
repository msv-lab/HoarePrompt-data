Example Answer: 
The code snippet `print(n + 1)` prints the value of `n + 1`. The previous values of all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the value of `n + 1` is printed.
