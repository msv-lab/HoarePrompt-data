Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If balance is equal to `x`, then `n` is incremented by 1 and the program prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`. This covers all scenarios including the cases where the balance is equal to `x`, the modulus condition is met, and the else block is executed with correct outputs provided for each scenario.***
