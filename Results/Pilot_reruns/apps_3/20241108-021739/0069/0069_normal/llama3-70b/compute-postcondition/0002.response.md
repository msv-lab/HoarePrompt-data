Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from input split by space. The input is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space**
