Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the input value. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space**
