Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x` are positive integers. `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance` are integers representing the count of '0's, count of '1's, and the difference between the counts respectively. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then the code snippet prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`***
