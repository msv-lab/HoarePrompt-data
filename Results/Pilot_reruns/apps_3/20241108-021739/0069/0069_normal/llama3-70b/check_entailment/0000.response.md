Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the desired balance `x`.
- It then reads the binary string `s` and calculates the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` to determine the balance.
- Depending on the balance compared to `x`, the code correctly prints different values following the problem description:
  1. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`.
  2. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1.
  3. Otherwise, it prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`.
  
The code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints also agree with the code functionality.
