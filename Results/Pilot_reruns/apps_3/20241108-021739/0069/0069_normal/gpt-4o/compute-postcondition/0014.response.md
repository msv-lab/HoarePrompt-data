According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` list is empty, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the integer value at index + 1 position in `data`, `s` is assigned the element at index 3 in `data`, `balance` is the result of s.count('0') - s.count('1'), `prefix_balances` is a list of 0s with a length of (n + 1), `i` is 2, `prefix_balances` list has been updated according to the formula provided.**
