Example Answer:
A list named `results` is initialized. The variables `data` contains the split elements of the input, `T` is an integer based on the first element of `data`, and `index` is 1. The list `results` is currently empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is an integer based on the first element of `data`, `index` is 1, and `results` list is empty.
Output State: **`data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is an integer based on the first element of `data`, `index` is 1, and `results` list is empty**
