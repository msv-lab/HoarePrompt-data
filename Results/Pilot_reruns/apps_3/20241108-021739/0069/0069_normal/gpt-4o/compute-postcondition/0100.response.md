Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration of the loop, while all other variables remain unchanged. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances[i]` remains unchanged. If balance is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`. If balance is not 0, and `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration; `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the condition. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances[i]`, `count`, and `results` remain unchanged.***
