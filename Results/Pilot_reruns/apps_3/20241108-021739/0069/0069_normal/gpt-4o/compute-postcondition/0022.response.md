Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances based on the binary string 's'. If x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to the results list. Otherwise, 0 is appended to the results list. In the case where n is greater than 0, the loop executes and updates the prefix_balances list accordingly. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of 0s. This ensures that the results list is modified based on the presence of x in prefix_balances, with -1 or 0 appended accordingly.***
