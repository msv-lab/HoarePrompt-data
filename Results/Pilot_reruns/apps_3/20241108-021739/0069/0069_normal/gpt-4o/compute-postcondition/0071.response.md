Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is updated to the integer value extracted from `data[index + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `s`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `results` remain unchanged, `index` is updated to the integer value extracted from `data[index]`.
Output State: **`x`, `s`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `results` remain unchanged, `index` is updated to the integer value extracted from `data[index]`**
