According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` list has at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 4 results, and the `result` should be the fourth result in the list.
State: **The loop executes, prefix_balances is updated with the final count value, results list has at least 4 results, result is the fourth result in the list**
