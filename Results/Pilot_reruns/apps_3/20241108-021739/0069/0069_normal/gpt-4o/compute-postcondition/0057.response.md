Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The state of the `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `prefix_balances` is not empty.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `prefix_balances` is not empty**
