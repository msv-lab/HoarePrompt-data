Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with `n + 1` zeros. The values of `x`, `balance`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to the value at `data[index + 2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `results` remain unchanged; `s` is updated to the value at `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`x`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `results` remain unchanged; `s` is updated to the value at `data[index + 2]**
