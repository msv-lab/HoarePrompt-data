According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `prefix_balances`. If there are more elements in `prefix_balances`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is an integer, and `prefix_balances` is not empty. So for the loop to execute one more time, `prefix_balances` must have more elements.
State: **`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` has more elements**
