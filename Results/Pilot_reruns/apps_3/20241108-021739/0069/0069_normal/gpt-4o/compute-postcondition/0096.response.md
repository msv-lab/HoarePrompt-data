Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, where `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration. `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied. This condition ensures that the program successfully increments the count when the calculated balance value meets the specified criteria.***
