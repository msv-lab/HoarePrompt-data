According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances[i+1]` is updated to the new calculated balance value. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`prefix_balances[i+2]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, all other variables remain unchanged**
