Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration, `count` is an integer incremented by 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration, `count` is an integer incremented by 1**
