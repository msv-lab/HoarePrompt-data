Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. If the previous value of `count` was unknown, after execution, `count` will be incremented by 1. The state of `prefix_balances` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has even more elements.
Output State: **`count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has even more elements**
