Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration of the loop, while all other variables remain unchanged. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances[i]` remains unchanged. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`.***
