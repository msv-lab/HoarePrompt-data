Example Answer:
Since the provided code snippet appends -1 to the results list without affecting the prefix_balances list, the output state is as follows: The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances based on the binary string 's'. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the prefix_balances list accordingly. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and prefix_balances remains a list of 0s. Additionally, the results list now contains -1 appended to it.
Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances based on the binary string 's'. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the prefix_balances list accordingly.
