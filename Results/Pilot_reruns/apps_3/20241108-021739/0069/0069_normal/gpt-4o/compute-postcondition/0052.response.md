Output State: If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, then after the loop executes, `x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the values of the variables remain the same. `results` appends `-1`.
