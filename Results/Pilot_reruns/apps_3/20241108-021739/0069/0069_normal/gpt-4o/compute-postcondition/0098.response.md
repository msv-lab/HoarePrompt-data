Output State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration. `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances[i]` remains unchanged, `count` is 0.**
