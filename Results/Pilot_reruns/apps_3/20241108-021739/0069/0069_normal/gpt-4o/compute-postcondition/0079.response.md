Example Answer:
`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, where `prefix_balances[i - 1]` holds the previous balance value and `s[i - 1]` is the character at the previous index. This update formula increments the balance by 1 if the character at index `i - 1` is '0' and decrements by 1 otherwise. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`prefix_balances[i+1]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, all other variables remain unchanged**
