Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly calculates the balance of the string and the prefix balances, but there are issues with the logic when determining the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The code fails to correctly handle cases where x is already in the prefix balances or when x is not in the prefix balances but there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.

For example, consider the test case where n = 2, x = 0, and s = "01". The code should output -1 as there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to 0. However, the code may not handle this case correctly due to the way it checks for the count of prefixes with the desired balance.
