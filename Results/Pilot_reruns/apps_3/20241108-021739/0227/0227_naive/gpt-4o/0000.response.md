Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first sorts the input sequence `a` in ascending order which helps in the logic implementation.
2. It then initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of the values that have been assigned to variables.
3. It starts with one variable `m = 1` and assigns the first element of `a` to the first variable.
4. Then, for each subsequent element in `a`, it checks if it can be formed using the values already assigned to variables. If not, it increments `m` to create a new variable.
5. This process ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations is calculated accurately.
6. The program then returns the minimum number of variables `m` required.

The program is correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement and is handling all potential cases.
