Output State: **`assigned` now contains the new elements `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, ..., `a[i+n], a[i]`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned` for any x in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1 and `assigned` still contains the new elements. If `can_form` is already True, `m` remains unchanged and `assigned` retains the new elements.**
