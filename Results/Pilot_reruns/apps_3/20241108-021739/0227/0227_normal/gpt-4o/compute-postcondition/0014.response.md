According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if there is still an element in the list `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next smallest positive integer in list `a`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the next smallest positive integer in list `a` (which is currently `x`) needs to be added to the `assigned` list so that the loop can iterate over it.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and next smallest positive integers in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True.**
