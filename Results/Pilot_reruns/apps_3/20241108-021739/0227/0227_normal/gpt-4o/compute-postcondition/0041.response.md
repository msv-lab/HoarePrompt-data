Example Answer:
The element `a[i]` is added to the set `assigned`. If there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and `m` is increased by 1. If no such element exists, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` is False, and `m` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`, `can_form` is True or False based on the conditions, and `m` is increased by 1 or remains unchanged**
