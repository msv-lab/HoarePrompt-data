Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a` with at least one element, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
