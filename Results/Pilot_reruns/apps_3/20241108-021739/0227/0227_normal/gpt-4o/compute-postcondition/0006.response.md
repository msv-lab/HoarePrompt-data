Since the loop iterates over the elements in the list `assigned`, the loop can execute if `assigned` is not empty. Given that `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, it implies that `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, the loop can execute. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to set `x` as the smallest positive integer in list `a`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`**
