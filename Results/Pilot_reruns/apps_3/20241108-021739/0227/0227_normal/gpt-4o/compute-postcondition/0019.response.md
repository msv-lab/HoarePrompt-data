Output State: **If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is ever met during the loop execution, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. The loop will run until either the condition is met or until the end of the `assigned` list. After the loop execution, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True if the condition is met, and `x` is the last element in the `assigned` list. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False.**
