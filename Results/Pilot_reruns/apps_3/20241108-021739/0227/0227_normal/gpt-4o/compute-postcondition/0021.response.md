Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is not met during the loop, `m` is increased by 1. The loop runs until either the condition is met or until the end of the `assigned` list. After the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is increased by 1, `can_form` is True if the condition is met, and `x` is the last element in the `assigned` list. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False.***
