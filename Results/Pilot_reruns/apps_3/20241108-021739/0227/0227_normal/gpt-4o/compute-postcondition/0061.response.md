According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` now contains the new elements `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, ..., `a[i+n], a[i]`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`, and `assigned` needs to contain the new elements including `a[i+n+1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`assigned` now contains the new elements `a[i+2]`, `a[i+3]`, ..., `a[i+n+1], a[i+1]`, `can_form` is either True or False, depending on the conditions, `m` may be increased by 1.**
