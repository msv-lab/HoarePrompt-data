Output State: **After adding `a[i]` to `assigned`, the loop continues to run until the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is met or until the end of the `assigned` list. If the condition is never met, `m` is increased by 1, and `can_form` remains True if the condition is met. `n` is still greater than 1, `a` remains a list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the last element in the `assigned` list.**
