Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the new element `a[i+1]`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `m` remains unchanged, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is exited. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
