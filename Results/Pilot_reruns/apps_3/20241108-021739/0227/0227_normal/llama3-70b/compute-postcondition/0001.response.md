Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted into a list of integers using the `map` function. The resulting list is assigned to variable `a`. The previous value of `n` is an input integer, and now `a` contains a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers**
