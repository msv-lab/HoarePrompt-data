Example Answer:
The value of `m` is increased by 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, where `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, where `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2**
