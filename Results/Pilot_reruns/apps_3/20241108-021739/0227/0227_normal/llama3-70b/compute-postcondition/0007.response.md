According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being equal to 2. In all other cases, `m` remains 1**
