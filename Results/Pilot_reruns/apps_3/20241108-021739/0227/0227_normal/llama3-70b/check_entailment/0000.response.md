Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- It sorts the list `a`.
- It iterates through the sorted list to check if each element is twice the previous element.
- If an element is not twice the previous element, it increments the variable `m`.
- Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations as explained in the problem statement. The algorithm ensures that each element in the sequence `a` can be represented by the sum of values stored in variables `b_i` and `b_j` (1 ≤ i, j ≤ m) as described. The output for the provided examples also matches the expected output, confirming the correctness of the code.
