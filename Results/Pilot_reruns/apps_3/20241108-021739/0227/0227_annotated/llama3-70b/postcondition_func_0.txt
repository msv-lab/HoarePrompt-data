The function reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and iterates through it to find elements that are not twice the value of the previous element, incrementing `m` accordingly. If the final value of `m` is less than or equal to 23, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. The function aims to rearrange the elements of the input list to maximize the difference between consecutive elements.
