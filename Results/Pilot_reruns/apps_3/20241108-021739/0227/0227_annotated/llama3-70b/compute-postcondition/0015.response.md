Output State: **If the loop executes, `m` is increased by 1 for each element of the list that does not follow the condition. If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is less than or equal to 23, `m` is printed. If `m` is greater than 23, -1 is printed. If `n` is 1 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1.**
