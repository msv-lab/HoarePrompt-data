Example Answer:
`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 1, so after execution, `m` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
