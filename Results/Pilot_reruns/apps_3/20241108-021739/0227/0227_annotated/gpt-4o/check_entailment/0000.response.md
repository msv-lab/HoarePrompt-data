Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the list of distinct positive integers in ascending order and checks if the current element can be formed by subtracting a value from the set of assigned variables. If the current element cannot be formed, it increments the count of variables needed. The code handles the case where the sequence of operations cannot be performed by returning -1. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and accurately describe the state of the program at different points. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
