Example Answer: 
The variable `assigned` is initialized as an empty set. Since this code snippet does not affect any other variables, the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `assigned` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set**
