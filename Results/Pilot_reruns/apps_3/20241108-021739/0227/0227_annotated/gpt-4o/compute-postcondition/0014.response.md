According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the set `assigned`. If there are more elements in the set, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the smallest positive integer in list `a` has been added to the set `assigned`, `x` is the next smallest positive integer in list `a`, and `can_form` is set to True if `a[i] - x` is present in the set `assigned`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The next smallest positive integer in list `a` after `x` should be added to the set `assigned`.
- If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, the state should remain unchanged.

State: **The next smallest positive integer in list `a` after `x` is added to the set `assigned`, `x` is updated to this new value, and `can_form` is set to True if `a[i] - x` is present in the set `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, the state remains unchanged.**
