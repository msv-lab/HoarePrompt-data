Output State: **`m` is an integer, `a` contains positive integers, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. `m` is incremented by 1.**
