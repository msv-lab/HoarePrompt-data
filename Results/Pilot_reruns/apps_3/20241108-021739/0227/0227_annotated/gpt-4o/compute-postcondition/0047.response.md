Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `a` contains positive integers, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the loop or if statement is broken if the condition is met. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
