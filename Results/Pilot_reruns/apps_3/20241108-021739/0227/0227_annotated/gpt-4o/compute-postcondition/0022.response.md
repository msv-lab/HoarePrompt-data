Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. `x` iterates through the positive integers in list `a`. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the state remains unchanged. If list `a` contains no positive integers, the loop will not execute and `can_form` will remain False. `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False.**
