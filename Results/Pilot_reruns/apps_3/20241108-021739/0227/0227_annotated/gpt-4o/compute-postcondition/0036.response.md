Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `i` is 2, `can_form` is either True or False, `assigned` has at least one element, and the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is true. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
