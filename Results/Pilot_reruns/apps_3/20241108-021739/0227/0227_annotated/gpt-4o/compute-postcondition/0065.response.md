Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer in the range of 1 to 23, and `a`, a list of distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. It then iterates through the list `a`, checking if there exists an element in the set `assigned` that can be formed by subtracting an element from `a`. The function returns the number of elements in the set `assigned`, representing how many elements were necessary to form each subsequent element in the list `a`.**
