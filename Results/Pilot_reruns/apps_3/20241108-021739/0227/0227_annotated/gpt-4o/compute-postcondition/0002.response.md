Example Answer:
`assigned` adds the first element of list `a` to itself, which is the value of `a[0]`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, the first element of `a` is the smallest positive integer in the list. Therefore, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`.
Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`**
