Example Answer:
r_queue is appended with the value r_index + n. The previous values of r_queue and r_index are unknown, so the output state is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue**
