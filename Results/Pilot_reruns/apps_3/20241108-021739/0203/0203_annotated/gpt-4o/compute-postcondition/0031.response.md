Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. The previous values of r_queue, n, votes, d_queue, and d_index are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue**
