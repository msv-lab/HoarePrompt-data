Example Answer: 
`i` is appended to the `r_queue` list, and `i` is 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue contains 0, i is 0, v is the first character in the votes string.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue contains 0, i is 0, v is the first character in the votes string**
