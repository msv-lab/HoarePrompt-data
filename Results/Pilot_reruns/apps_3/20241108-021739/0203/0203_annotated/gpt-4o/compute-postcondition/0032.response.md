Example Answer:
`d_index` is added to `n` and then appended to `d_queue`. The value of `n` represents the number of employees, and the value of `d_index` is the value popped from `d_queue`, so the new value added to `d_queue` is `d_index + n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty with the new value added, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty with the new value added, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue**
