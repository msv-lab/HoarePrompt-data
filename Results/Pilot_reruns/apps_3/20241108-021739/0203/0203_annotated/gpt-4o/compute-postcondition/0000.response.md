Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of employees. The range of `n` is between 1 and 200,000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
