Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now `[0]`, and `i` remains 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character, d_queue is `[0]`, r_queue is an empty list, i is 0, v is the first character in the votes string.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character, d_queue is [0], r_queue is an empty list, i is 0, v is the first character in the votes string**
