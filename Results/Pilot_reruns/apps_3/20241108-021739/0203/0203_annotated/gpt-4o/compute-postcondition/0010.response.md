Example Answer: 
If the initial state is n is an integer representing the number of employees and votes is a string representing the votes, and if the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 0. After executing `r_queue.append(i)`, the value of i is appended to the r_queue. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes with at least 2 characters, and r_queue contains the index i.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes with at least 2 characters, r_queue contains the index i**
