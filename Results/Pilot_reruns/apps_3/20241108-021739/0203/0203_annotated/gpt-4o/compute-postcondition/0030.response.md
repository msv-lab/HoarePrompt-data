Example Answer: 
The value at the index 0 of d_queue is popped and assigned to d_index. As d_queue is non-empty, the value at index 0 is removed from d_queue and assigned to d_index. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty and d_index contains the value popped from d_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty, d_index contains the value popped from d_queue**
