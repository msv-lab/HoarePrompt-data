Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty. If d_index is less than r_index, the value d_index + n is appended to d_queue. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, the value r_index + n is appended to r_queue. In either case, the overall state of the program ensures that the required values are updated in the respective queues based on the comparison of d_index and r_index.***
