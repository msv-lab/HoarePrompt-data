Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 3 characters. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 1 and r_queue remains unchanged. If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then r_queue contains index 1 and d_queue remains unchanged. In all cases, after the execution of the if else block, the appropriate queue (d_queue or r_queue) contains the added index i based on the condition met.***
