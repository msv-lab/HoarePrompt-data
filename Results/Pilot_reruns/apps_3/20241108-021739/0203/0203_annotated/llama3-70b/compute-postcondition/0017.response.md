Output State: 
If the list of fractions is empty, the loop will not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0. 
If the list contains only 'D' fractions, `depublicans` will be equal to the number of 'D' fractions, and `remocrats` will remain 0. 
If the list contains only 'R' fractions, `remocrats` will be equal to the number of 'R' fractions, and `depublicans` will remain 0. 
If the list contains a mix of 'D' and 'R' fractions, `depublicans` and `remocrats` will be incremented accordingly based on the fractions present in the list.

**If the list is empty, depublicans and remocrats are 0. If the list contains only 'D' fractions, depublicans is the count of 'D' fractions, remocrats is 0. If the list contains only 'R' fractions, remocrats is the count of 'R' fractions, depublicans is 0. If the list contains a mix of 'D' and 'R' fractions, depublicans and remocrats are incremented based on the fractions present.**
