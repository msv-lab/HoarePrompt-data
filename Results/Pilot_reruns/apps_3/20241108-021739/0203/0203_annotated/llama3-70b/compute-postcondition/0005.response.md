Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, fractions is a non-empty list of fractions with `fraction` as the first fraction in the list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, fractions is a non-empty list of fractions with `fraction` as the first fraction in the list**
