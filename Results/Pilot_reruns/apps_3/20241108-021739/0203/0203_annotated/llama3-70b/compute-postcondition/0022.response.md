Functionality: The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the fractions of employees and a string `fractions` consisting of 'D's and 'R's. It then counts the occurrences of 'D's and 'R's in the string. If there are more 'D's than 'R's, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it reads input from the user. The functionality accurately reflects the code's behavior, accounting for various scenarios like an empty input string and handling the majority party determination based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' fractions.
