The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, and `n` is a positive integer representing fractions of employees. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains unchanged**
