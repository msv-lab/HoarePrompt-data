Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for each fraction, and iterates through the votes based on the order of employees. It handles the scenarios where an employee denies voting rights to another by appropriately updating the queue indices. The program correctly determines the outcome based on the last remaining eligible voter. Since the code covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately, it is correct.
