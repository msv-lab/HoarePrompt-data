Example Answer:
`d_queue` is appended with the value of `d_index + n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000. The length of the `d_queue` increases by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` has been modified by appending `d_index + n`, `r_queue` may have been modified based on the specific scenario, `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` has been modified by appending `d_index + n`, `r_queue` may have been modified based on the specific scenario, `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`**
