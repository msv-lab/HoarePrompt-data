Example Answer: 
The list `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
