Example Answer:
`r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends the sum of `r_index` and `n` to the end of `r_queue`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 200,000, and `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` has been modified, `r_queue` may have been modified based on the specific scenario, `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has been appended with the sum of `r_index` and `n`.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` has been modified, `r_queue` may have been modified based on the specific scenario, `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has been appended with the sum of `r_index` and `n**.
