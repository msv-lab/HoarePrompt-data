Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty, after the execution of the if-else block, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in votes with potential additional indices appended based on the comparison of d_index and r_index. r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in votes with potential additional indices appended based on the comparison of d_index and r_index. If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty. If either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty during the execution of the if-else block, the loop will terminate. No changes in the state occur as a result of the provided code snippet, as it only prints 'D' if d_queue is non-empty and 'R' otherwise.***
