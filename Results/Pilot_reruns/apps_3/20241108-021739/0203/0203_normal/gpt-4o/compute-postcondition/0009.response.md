Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `i` is the index of the last character iterated over, so `i` is added to `d_queue`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is the index of the last character iterated over, and `v` is the last character iterated over.
