According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are as follows:
1. If `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` can be either empty or not empty.
2. If `r_queue` is not empty, `d_queue` can be either empty or not empty.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If d_index < r_index, d_queue appends d_index + n indices, and r_queue remains unchanged. If d_index >= r_index, r_queue contains the indices of all 'R' characters in votes along with an additional index r_index + n. If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty.**
