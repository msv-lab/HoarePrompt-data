Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If d_index < r_index, d_queue appends d_index + n indices, and r_queue remains unchanged. If d_index >= r_index, r_queue contains the indices of all 'R' characters in votes along with an additional index r_index + n. If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty.***
