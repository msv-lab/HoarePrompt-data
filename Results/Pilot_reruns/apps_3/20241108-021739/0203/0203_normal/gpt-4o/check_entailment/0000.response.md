Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately follows the problem description by simulating the voting process of depublicans and remocrats. 
- It correctly assigns indices to 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string and forms queues accordingly.
- The code iterates through the queues and adjusts indices based on comparisons, ensuring that the correct employee denies the other's right to vote.
- The code correctly prints 'D' if the depublicans win and 'R' if the remocrats win based on the remaining elements in the queues.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring the outcome of the vote is determined accurately.
