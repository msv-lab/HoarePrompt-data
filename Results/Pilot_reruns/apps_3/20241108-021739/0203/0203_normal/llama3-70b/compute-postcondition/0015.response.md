Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 3 elements. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` has been incremented by 1. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` has been incremented by 1. Appropriate increments have been made to either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the logic of the if-else block.***
