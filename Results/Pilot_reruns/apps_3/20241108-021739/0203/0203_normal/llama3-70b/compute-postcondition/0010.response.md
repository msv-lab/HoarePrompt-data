Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, `remocrats` is increased by 1**
