According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since each character in `fractions` is either 'D' or 'R', it is already in a valid state to start the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 1 element, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 1 element, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
