Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After each execution of the loop, if the current fraction is 'D', `depublicans` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` will be incremented by 1. The final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` will reflect the total count of 'D's and 'R's in the `fractions` list. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0.**
