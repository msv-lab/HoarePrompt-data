The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` where each character is either 'D' or 'R'. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D's is greater than the count of 'R's, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not have any return value and operates based on predefined input constraints.
