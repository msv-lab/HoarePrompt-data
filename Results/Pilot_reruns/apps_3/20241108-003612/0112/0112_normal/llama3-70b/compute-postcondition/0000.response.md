Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is dependent on the user input, so it can be any integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
