According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least 2 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing string representations of digits from the first cube, cube is the first cube in the list.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 2 cubes, and the cube variable should be pointing to the second cube in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the second cube, `cube` is the second cube in the list**
