Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `max_num`, but it does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **cubes is a list with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes except '0', cube is the last cube in the list. If '0' was in digits, it was removed.**
