According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the set digits is empty. So for the loop to be executed, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube variable should be the first cube in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
