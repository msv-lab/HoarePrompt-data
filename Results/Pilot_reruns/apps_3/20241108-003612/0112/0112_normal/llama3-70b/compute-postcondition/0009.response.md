According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 cubes. To execute the loop one more time, the cubes list must have at least 4 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 4 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the third cube**
