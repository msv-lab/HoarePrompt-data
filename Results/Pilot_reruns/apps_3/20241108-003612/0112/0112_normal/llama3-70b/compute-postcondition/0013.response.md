Example Answer:
The program creates a new variable `max_num` which is assigned the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order and joined together. The variable `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes except '0'. If '0' exists in digits, it is removed. The variables `cubes`, `digits`, and `cube` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.
Output State: **cubes is a list with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes except '0', cube is the last cube in the list. If '0' was in digits, it was removed.**
