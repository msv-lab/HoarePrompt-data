Example Answer:
The string representation of '0' is removed from the set `digits`. Since '0' is a digit, `digits` no longer contains the string representation of '0'. The other variables `cubes` and `cube` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **If cubes is a list with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes except '0', `cube` is the last cube in the list. If cubes is an empty list, `digits` remains an empty set and `cube` is not defined**
