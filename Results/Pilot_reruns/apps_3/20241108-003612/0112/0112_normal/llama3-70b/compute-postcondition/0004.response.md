Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the first cube in the list and converts it to a string before updating the `digits` set with these string representations. The `digits` set will now contain the string representations of each digit in the first cube. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
