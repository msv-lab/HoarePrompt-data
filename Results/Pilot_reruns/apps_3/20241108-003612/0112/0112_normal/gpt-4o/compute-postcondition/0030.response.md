The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a list of digits representing the number to be formed using the cubes. The function checks if the given number can be formed using the available cubes. 

Case1: If the list of digits `num` is empty, the function returns False without making any changes to the state. If `num` is not empty, the function iterates through the elements of `used_cubes`, checking for matches and updating the state accordingly. The final state will have `used_cubes` updated based on the matches found, `found` set to True if a match was found, and `i` equal to the number of iterations that occurred. If there are more digits than available cube faces, the loop will not execute completely, and `found` will remain False.

Case2: If the list of digits `num` is empty, the function returns False without making any changes to the state. If `num` is not empty, the function iterates through the elements of `used_cubes`, checking for matches and updating the state accordingly. The final state will have `used_cubes` updated based on the matches found, `found` set to True if a match was found, and `i` equal to the number of iterations that occurred. If there are more digits than available cube faces, the loop will not execute completely, and `found` will remain False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a list of digits `num` and determine if the number can be formed using the available cubes, updating the state accordingly and returning True if a match is found, otherwise returning False.
