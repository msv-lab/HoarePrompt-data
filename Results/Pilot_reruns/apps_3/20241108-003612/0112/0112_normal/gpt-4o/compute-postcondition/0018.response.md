Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the `i-th` element set to `True`, `found` is True, and `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
