Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if not already used and `found` is True if a match is found, `i` is 0. The program breaks out of the loop or if statement after checking if the `i-th` cube is unused and the digit is in the list of cube faces for that cube.***
