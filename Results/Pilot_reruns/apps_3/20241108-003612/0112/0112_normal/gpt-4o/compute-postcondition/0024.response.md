Example Answer:
`found` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `used_cubes` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `used_cubes` updated based on matches found, `found` is False, `i` incremented by 1.
Output State: **`used_cubes` updated based on matches found, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
