According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is False, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
