Output State: **If `digits` is empty, return False. Otherwise, the loop iterates through the elements of `used_cubes` checking for matches and updating the state accordingly. The final state will have `used_cubes` updated, `found` set to True if a match was found, and `i` equal to the number of iterations that occurred.**
