Example Answer:
Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers. `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` with a length of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Therefore, after execution, the `used_cubes` list will have `n` elements initialized to `False`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers; `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`**
