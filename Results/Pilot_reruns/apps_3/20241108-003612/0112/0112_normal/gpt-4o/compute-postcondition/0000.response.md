Example Answer:
Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, and `num` is converted to a string and then to a list of individual digits. So, the `digits` list will contain the individual digits of `num`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers; `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num`**
