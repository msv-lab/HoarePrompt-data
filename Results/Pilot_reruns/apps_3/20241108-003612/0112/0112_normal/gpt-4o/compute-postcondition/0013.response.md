Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if not already used, `found` is True, `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, and `found` is set to True. The loop is exited after this condition is met.***
