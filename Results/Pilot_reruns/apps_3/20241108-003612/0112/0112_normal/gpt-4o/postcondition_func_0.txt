The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube (0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9). The function iterates through numbers starting from 1 until `can_form_number` returns false, and then returns the last number before the condition is not met. If `can_form_number` does not return false for numbers up to 4, then the function will return 4. Therefore, the function returns the value of x based on the described conditions.
