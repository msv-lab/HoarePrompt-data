Example Answer: 
The code iterates over each digit in the cube, converts it to a string, and adds it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is the first cube in the list, the set `digits` is updated with the string representation of each digit in the first cube. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, cube is the first cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the first cube.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, cube is the first cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the first cube**
