According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, cube is the second cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list, and digits should be updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube**
