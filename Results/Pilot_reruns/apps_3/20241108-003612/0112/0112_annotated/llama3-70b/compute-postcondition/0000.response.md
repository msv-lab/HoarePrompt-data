Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The number of cubes represented by lists of 6 integers each is determined by `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes**
