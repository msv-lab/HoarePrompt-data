Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `max_num`. The initial state mentions that `max_num` is the integer formed by sorting digits in descending order after removing '0'. Without knowing the specific digits, it can be inferred that `max_num` is a number with the digits sorted in descending order and without any zeros.
Output State: **`max_num` is the integer formed by sorting digits in descending order after removing '0'**
