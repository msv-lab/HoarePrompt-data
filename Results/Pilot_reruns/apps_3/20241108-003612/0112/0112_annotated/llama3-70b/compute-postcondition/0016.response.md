Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of cubes. It then reads `n` cubes, each consisting of 6 integers between 0 and 9. The function constructs a set of unique digits from all cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, converts them back to an integer, and prints the resulting maximum number. The function does not return any value but serves as a verification tool for the given cubes.**
