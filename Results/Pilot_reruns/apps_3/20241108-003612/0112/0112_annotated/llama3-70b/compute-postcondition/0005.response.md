According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, cube is the first cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the first cube. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 2 cubes, and the cube should be the second cube in the list, and digits should be updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, cube is the second cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube**
