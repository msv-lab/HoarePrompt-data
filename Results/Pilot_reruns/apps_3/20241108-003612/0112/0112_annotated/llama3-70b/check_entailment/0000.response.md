2. It then removes the digit '0' from the set of digits since leading zeros are not allowed in the final number.
3. The program then sorts the remaining digits in descending order and forms the maximum number possible using those digits.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum number that Masha can make with the given cubes.
5. The code logic aligns with the problem description, and based on the provided examples, it produces the correct output.
