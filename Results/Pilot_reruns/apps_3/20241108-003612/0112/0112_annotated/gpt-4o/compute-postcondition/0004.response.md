Since the loop executes n times, the loop can execute if n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans initialized to False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
