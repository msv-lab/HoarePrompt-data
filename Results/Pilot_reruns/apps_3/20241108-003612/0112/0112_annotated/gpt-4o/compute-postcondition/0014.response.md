According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, and `found` is True if a matching cube face was found and the loop is terminated at i = 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` and `found` needs to be adjusted to False.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, `found` is False**
