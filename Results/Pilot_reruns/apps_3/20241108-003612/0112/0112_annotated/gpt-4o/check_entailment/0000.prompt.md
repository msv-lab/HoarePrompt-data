You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    #State of the program here: Precondition
    x = 0
    #State of the program here: `x` is 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the function can_form_number(x + 1) returns true for x = 0, x = 1, x = 3, and x = 4, then x will be 4 after the loop execution. If the function can_form_number(x + 1) returns false for x = 0, then the loop will not execute, and x will remain 0.
    return x
    #State of the program after the return statement: x is 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: n and cubes. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and cubes is a list of length n containing lists of 6 integers. The function always returns 4.


#Function 2:
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`.
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans initialized to False
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop iterates over each digit in the list `digits` and checks if there is a cube face in `cube_faces` that contains that digit and has not been used before. If such a face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a matching face is not found for any digit, the loop returns False. The loop may not execute if `digits` is empty or if all available cube faces with the required digits have already been used.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: The loop returns True
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a positive integer. The function also has a loop that iterates over each digit in a list `digits`. The loop checks if there is a cube face in `cube_faces` that contains that digit and has not been used before. If such a face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a matching face is not found for any digit, the loop returns False. The loop may not execute if `digits` is empty or if all available cube faces with the required digits have already been used.
#
#If the loop completes successfully without returning False, it returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, iterate over each digit in a list `digits`, and check if there are corresponding cube faces in `cube_faces` that can form the number. It returns True if the number can be formed using the cube faces, otherwise it returns False.





I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
