The function `can_form_number` takes a positive integer `num` and checks if it can be formed using cube faces stored in `cube_faces`. It iterates over each digit in `num` and looks for a cube face that contains that digit and has not been used before. If a matching face is found for each digit, it returns True. If any digit cannot be matched to a cube face, it returns False. The function covers the case where `digits` is empty or if all available cube faces with the required digits have already been used.
