According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + l) % MOD` which means `total_sum` is updated to `l % MOD`. Otherwise, there are no changes in the variables. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to the next value after `l`, and the conditions need to be checked again.

State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**.
