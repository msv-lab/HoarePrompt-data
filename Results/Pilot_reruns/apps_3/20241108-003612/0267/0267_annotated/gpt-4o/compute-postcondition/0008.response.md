Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The value of `num` is `l + 2`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` is `(total_sum + l + 2) % MOD`, and `num` is still `l + 2`. The values of `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 2) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
