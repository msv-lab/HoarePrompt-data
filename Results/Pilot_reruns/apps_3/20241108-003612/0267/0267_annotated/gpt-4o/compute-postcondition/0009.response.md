Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is equal to `(l + 2 + total_sum) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 2`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 2) % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `total_sum`, `num`, and `l`, and the program continues with the initial values.***
