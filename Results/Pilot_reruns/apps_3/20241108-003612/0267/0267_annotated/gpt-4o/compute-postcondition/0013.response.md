The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. 

If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If the loop executes, `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, and the function returns `total_sum`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` that satisfy a specific condition based on `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD` if the loop executes. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0.
