Example Answer:
The `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is `l + 1`, and the value of `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(l % MOD + (l + 1)) % MOD`. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the new value calculated**
