Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous values of variables are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression**
