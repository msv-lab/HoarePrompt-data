According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` being a non-negative integer does not ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 1, `n` can be any non-negative integer, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1**
