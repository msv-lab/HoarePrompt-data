Functionality: **The function `count` accepts three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store previously calculated values. The function has three cases: Case 1 handles the scenario where `k` is zero, and in this case, the function returns 0. Case 2 deals with whether the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, returning the stored value if present, or maintaining the state of the program variables otherwise. Case 3 involves updating the dictionary `dp` based on specific conditions related to `n` and `k`, including setting the value to 9, updating through a formula, and taking the modulo `MOD`. The function's functionality is to handle different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`, updating the dictionary `dp` accordingly.**
