Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then the value at key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp` is updated to `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, the value at key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp` is updated as follows: it is first set to 9, then iteratively updated based on the range of `i` from 1 to `k` using the formula 9 * 10^(i - 1) * (10^(k - i) - 10^(i - 1)), and finally updated by (10^(k - 1) - 10^(k - 2)) * (n // 10^(k - 1) - 1). The value at key (n, k) is then taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it stays within the desired range.***
