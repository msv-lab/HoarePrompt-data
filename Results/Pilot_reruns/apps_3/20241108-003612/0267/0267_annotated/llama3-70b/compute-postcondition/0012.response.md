According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is updated with a new value, `i` is 4**
