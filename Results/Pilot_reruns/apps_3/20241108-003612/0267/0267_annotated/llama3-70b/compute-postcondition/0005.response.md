Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
