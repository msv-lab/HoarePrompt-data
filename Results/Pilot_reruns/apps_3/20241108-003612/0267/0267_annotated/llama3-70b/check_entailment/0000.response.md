Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`. 

1. `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` satisfying the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It utilizes the `count` function to achieve this. The function correctly calculates the sum of numbers within the given range that meet the criteria.

2. `count` function handles the counting of numbers within the specified range and with at most `k` different digits. It correctly computes the count based on the provided constraints and returns the result modulo `998244353`.

Both functions follow the problem description and handle the edge cases mentioned in the annotations. The code is logically sound and implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.
