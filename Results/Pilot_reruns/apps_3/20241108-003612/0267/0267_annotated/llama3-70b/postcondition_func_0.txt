The function func_1 takes three integers l, r, and k as parameters and calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. However, the actual functionality of the function is not explicitly clear from the provided annotations. It seems to involve some form of counting calculation with specific constraints, but the exact details and constraints are not defined in the annotations. Additionally, the annotations mention a dictionary dp, which might be used for memoization or caching purposes. The function does not necessarily keep l, r, and k unchanged as stated in the annotations. The function seems to rely on the count function for the actual computation. Further clarification on the constraints, the count function, and the purpose of MOD is needed to fully understand the functionality of this function.
