According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions that need to be adjusted are `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values with key (n, k) set to 9. For the loop to execute, `n` should be set to 0, `k` should be set to 2, and the key (n, k) should be added to the dictionary dp.
State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 2, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values with key (n, k) set to 9**
