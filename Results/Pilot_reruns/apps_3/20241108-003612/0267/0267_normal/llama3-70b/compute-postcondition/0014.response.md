Example Answer:
The code updates the value stored in the `dp` dictionary for key (n, k) by adding the calculated value. Since `k` is 1, the loop does not execute. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `k` is 1, and `dp` dictionary still stores the updated value for key (0, 1).
Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `dp` dictionary still stores the updated value for key (0, 1)**
