Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not provided, so the exact value cannot be calculated. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `k` is 1, and `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k).
Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k)**
