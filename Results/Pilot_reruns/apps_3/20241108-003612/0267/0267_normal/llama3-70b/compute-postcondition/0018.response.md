The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer, `k`, which is a positive integer, and `dp`, which is a dictionary to store computed values. 

Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case 3: If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value. If `n` is less than 10, the function also returns the corresponding value. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store computed values. Depending on the conditions stated in the Cases, the function returns different values or handles the variables accordingly.
