Example Answer:
The function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If n and k are as described, the function will return the value from the dictionary dp. No changes are made to the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values**
