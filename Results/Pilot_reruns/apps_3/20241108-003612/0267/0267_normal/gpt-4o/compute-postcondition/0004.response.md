According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.

To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to the next integer in the range `[l, r]`. Since `num` is currently equal to `l`, it needs to be updated to `l + 1`. No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
