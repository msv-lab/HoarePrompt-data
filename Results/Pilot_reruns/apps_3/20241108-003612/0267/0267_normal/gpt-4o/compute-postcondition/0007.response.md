According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `num` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next value within the specified range.
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `(l + 1) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`**.
