The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, if l is greater than r, total_sum remains 0. If l is equal to r, total_sum will be the result of func_1(l, k) if true. If l is less than r, total_sum will be the sum of all num values where func_1(num, k) is true. The final values of total_sum, num, l, and r will be integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and calculate the total sum based on the conditions mentioned.
