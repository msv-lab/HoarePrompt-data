According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Since the loop updates `num` based on `(l + 1) + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be updated accordingly to `(r + 1) + 1`. Also, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, so `total_sum` needs to be adjusted accordingly based on the updated `num` value.
State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 1) + 1) % MOD`, `num` is updated to `(r + 1) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
