According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variables `num`, `l`, and `r` need to be considered. The loop will execute as long as the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) has at least one number. Since the initial total_sum is 0, we need to ensure that the range specified by `l` to `r` includes at least one number. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
