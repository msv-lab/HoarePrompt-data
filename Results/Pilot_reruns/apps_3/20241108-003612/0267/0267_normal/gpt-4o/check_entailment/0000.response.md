Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program consists of two functions. 
Function number 1 (`func_1`) checks if the number of unique digits in the string representation of a number `n` is less than or equal to `k`. This function correctly determines if a number contains at most `k` different digits.

Function number 2 (`func_2`) calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The function iterates over the range `[l, r]` and checks if each number meets the condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, the number is added to the total sum, and the sum is calculated modulo `998244353`. The logic implemented in this function correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code handles the edge cases of `l` being equal to `r`, `l` being greater than `r`, and all other cases where the sum needs to be calculated correctly.
