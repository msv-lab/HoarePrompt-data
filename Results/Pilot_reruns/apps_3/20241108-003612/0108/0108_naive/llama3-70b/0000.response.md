Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the alphabet characters and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order until the string contains all the alphabet characters. The program then checks if the resulting string has a length of 26 (the length of the alphabet), and if so, prints it. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic ensures that the output string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the described problem.
