Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if it is possible to obtain a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence from the input string. It iterates through both strings and checks if the characters match to form the English alphabet. If a match is found, it moves to the next character in the target alphabet. If it successfully iterates through the entire target alphabet, it prints the target alphabet. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
