Example Answer: 
The first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet. The initial value of `char` is 'a', so 'a' will be replaced with 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
