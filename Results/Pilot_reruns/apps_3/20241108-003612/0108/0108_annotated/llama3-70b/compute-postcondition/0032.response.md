Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, which is 'a'. The loop will not execute if 'a' is not in `s`, and `s` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains 'a', `res` is a string of 'b's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', `char` remains 'a', and `res` is concatenated with 'a'.
Output State: **If 's' contains 'a', `res` is a string of 'b's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', `char` remains 'a', and `res` is concatenated with 'a'**
