Postcondition: ***If 's' contains 'a', the length of `res` is 26 and `res` is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If 's' contains 'a', `res` will be a string of 'b's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', while `char` remains 'a'. The loop will not execute if 'a' is not in `s`.***
