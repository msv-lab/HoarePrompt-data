According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet` variable. If the alphabet variable contains at least one character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state so that `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` variable.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
