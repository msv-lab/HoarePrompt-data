Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with `char`, so after execution, `res` becomes 'aa'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
