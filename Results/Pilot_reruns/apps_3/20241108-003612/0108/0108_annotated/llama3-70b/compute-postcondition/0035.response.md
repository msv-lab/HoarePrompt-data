Output State: **If 's' contains 'a', `res` is a string of 'b's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', `char` remains 'a' and the loop will not execute if 'a' is not in `s` and `res` is concatenated with 'a' after each iteration. The loop will continue until all occurrences of 'a' are replaced by 'b' in `s`, and then the loop will terminate.**
