The function `func` reads a string `s` input by the user, consisting of small English letters. It then iterates through the alphabet, replacing occurrences of each letter in the input string with the next letter in the alphabet. If the resulting string contains 26 occurrences of 'b', it will print that string. Otherwise, it will print -1. The function does not have specific return values but prints the modified string or -1 based on the conditions mentioned.
