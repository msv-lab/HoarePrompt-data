Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code takes a string `s` as input, then iterates over the English alphabet. For each letter in the alphabet, it replaces all occurrences of that letter in the input string `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (indicating that all letters of the alphabet are present as a subsequence), it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The code logic aligns with the problem description as it aims to obtain a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The code correctly handles the case where all letters of the alphabet are present in the input string by replacing each letter with its next alphabetical character until the alphabet is a subsequence of the modified string. If the alphabet is successfully obtained, it is printed, otherwise, -1 is printed.

Since the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output based on the requirements, the correctness is evaluated as True.
