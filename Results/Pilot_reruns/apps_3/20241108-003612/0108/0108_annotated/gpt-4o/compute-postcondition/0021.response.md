Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of only small English letters. It then iterates through the characters of `s` and checks if they match the characters in the predefined string `target` ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') in order. If all characters match, it prints the string `target`, otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value. Edge cases such as empty `s` or `target` strings are considered, and the behavior for strings longer than the target is also handled.**
