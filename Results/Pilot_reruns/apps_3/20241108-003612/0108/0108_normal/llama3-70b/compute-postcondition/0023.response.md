According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if 'a' is in the initial string s, then s does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', res contains all occurrences of 'a' that were replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in s. If 'a' is not in the initial string s, then res is an empty string and char is the next character in the alphabet, and char is in s. 
So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, if 'a' is in the initial string s, then s should not contain 'a' but should contain 'b', and res should contain all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in s. If 'a' is not in the initial string s, then res should be an empty string and char should be the next character in the alphabet, and char should be in s.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 'a' is in the initial string s, then s does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', res contains all occurrences of 'a' that were replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in s. If 'a' is not in the initial string s, then res is an empty string and char is the next character in the alphabet, and char is in s.**
