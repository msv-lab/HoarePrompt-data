Example Answer:
The character 'a' is replaced with the next character in the alphabet in `s`. If 'a' is still present in `s`, `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`. The `res` variable will contain all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and then `res` appends the next character in the alphabet after the current `char` if 'a' is still present in `s`.
Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char' and 'a' is still in `s`, `res` appends the next character in the alphabet after the current `char'**
