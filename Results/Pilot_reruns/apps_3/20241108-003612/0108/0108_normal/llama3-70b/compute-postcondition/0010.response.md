Example Answer: 
`res` is concatenated with `char`, so the value of `res` changes to include `char`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b' and contains another occurrence of `char`, `char` is in `s`, `res` is the updated string after concatenating `char`.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b' and contains another occurrence of `char`, `char` is in `s`, `res` is the updated string after concatenating `char`**
