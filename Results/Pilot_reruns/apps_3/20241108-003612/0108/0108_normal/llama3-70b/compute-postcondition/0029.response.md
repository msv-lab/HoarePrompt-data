Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`. The value of `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`.
Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`**
