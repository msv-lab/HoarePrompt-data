Example Answer:
The first character of the `alphabet` string is added to the `res` string. As `res` is initially empty, after execution, `res` will contain the first character of the `alphabet` string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` contains the first character of the `alphabet` string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` contains the first character of the `alphabet` string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
