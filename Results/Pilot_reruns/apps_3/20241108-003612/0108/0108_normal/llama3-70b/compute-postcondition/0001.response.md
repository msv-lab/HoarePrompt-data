Example Answer:
The variable `alphabet` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This assignment does not affect the variable `s`, which is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
