According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 5 and `j` is either 1 or 4. No changes are made to `s`. However, if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted so that it is less than the length of `s` and `j` needs to be adjusted so that it is less than the length of `target`, taking into account the increment conditions. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of string `target`, `i` is increased by 5, `j` is either 1 or 4**
