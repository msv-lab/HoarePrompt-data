`s` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input as a string. Since the input string `s` is guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters, the value of `s` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5**
