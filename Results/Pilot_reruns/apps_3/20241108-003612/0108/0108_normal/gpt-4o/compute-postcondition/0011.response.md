According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2 and `j` may have been incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is increased by 4.
- `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is either 1 or 3, depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of string `target`, `i` is increased by 4, `j` is either 1 or 3**
