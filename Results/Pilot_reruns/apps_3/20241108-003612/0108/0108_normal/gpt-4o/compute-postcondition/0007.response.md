According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1 and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition `s[i] == target[j]`. To execute the loop one more time, both `i` and `j` need to be adjusted so that they satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of the string `target`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1**
