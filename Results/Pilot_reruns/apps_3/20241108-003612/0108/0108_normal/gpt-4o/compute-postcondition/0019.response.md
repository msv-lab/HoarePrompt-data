Postcondition: ***If target_len is greater than 0, after the loop executes, i is increased by the minimum value between the length of s and target_len. j is either 0 or the number of characters in s that match the corresponding characters in target. If s and target have no common characters, j remains 0. If target_len is 0, i is incremented by the length of s, and j remains 0. If s is an empty string, i remains 0, and j remains 0. After the if else block executes, the program either prints the value of the variable target if j equals target_len, or prints -1 if j does not equal target_len.***
