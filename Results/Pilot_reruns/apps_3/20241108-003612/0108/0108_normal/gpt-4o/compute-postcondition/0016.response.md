Output State: **If target_len is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, i is increased by the minimum value between the length of s and target_len, j is either 0 or the number of characters in s that match the corresponding characters in target. If s and target have no common characters, j remains 0. If target_len is 0, then i is incremented by the length of s, j remains 0. If s is an empty string, i remains 0, j remains 0.**
