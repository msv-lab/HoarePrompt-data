Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string `s` and initializes the target string `target` as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It then iterates through the characters of the input string `s` and the target string `target`, trying to match them. If it successfully matches all characters in order, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. 

The program logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. It checks for the presence of the English alphabet as a subsequence in the input string `s` and outputs the correct result accordingly.
