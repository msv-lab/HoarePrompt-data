Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and iterates through each character of the alphabet. For each character, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until all characters are processed. If the resulting string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and correctly handles the task of obtaining a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected.
