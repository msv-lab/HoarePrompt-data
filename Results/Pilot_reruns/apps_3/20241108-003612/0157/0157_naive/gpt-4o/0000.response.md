Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It first determines the maximum number of compotes that can be made based on the ratio constraint (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each compote) and then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the number of compotes with the respective fruit quantities. The logic is correct for all possible cases and adheres to the problem description.
