The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function only calculates the sum of squares of the positive integers a, b, and c provided as input. The function then returns the result of this calculation. The input values a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of squares of the positive integers a, b, and c, and returns the result.**
