Example Answer: 
`max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4 respectively. 
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers which can have any values. The value of `max_lemons` is the minimum among them, so it depends on the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `total_fruits` is calculated based on `max_lemons` which is dependent on the input values provided. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the calculated `total_fruits` based on the input values.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the calculated `total_fruits` based on the input values**
