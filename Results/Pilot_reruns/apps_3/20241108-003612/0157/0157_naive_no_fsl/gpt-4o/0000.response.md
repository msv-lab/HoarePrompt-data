Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by finding the minimum of the ratios of lemons, apples, and pears. It then multiplies this minimum by the corresponding ratios (1, 2, 4) and prints the total number of fruits. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
