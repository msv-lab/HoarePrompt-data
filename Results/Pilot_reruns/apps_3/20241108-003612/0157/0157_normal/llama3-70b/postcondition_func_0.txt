The function prompts the user to input three integers a, b, and c. It then calculates the minimum value among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. After that, it prints the sum of the minimum value, twice the minimum value, and four times the minimum value. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for the integer values.
