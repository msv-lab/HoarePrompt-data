Example Answer: 
`min_lemon` holds the smallest value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The program then prints the sum of `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` holds the smallest value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the program prints the sum of `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` holds the smallest value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the program prints the sum of `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4**
