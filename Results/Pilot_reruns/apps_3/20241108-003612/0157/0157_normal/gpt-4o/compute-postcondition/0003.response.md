Example Answer:
max_lemons is assigned the minimum value among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. Therefore, the value of max_lemons is the minimum value of a, b // 2, and c // 4. The output state is: a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is an input integer, max_lemons is the minimum value of a, b // 2, and c // 4.
Output State: **a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is an input integer, max_lemons is the minimum value of a, b // 2, and c // 4**
