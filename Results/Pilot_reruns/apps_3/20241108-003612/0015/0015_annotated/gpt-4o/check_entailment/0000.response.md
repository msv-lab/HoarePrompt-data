Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly handles all cases as described in the problem description:
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, it prints "YES".
2. If the difference between the favorite number and the first element is 0, it prints "NO".
3. If the difference between the favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements (c) and the division result is non-negative, it prints "YES".
4. In all other cases, it prints "NO".

The code logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and covers all potential scenarios.
