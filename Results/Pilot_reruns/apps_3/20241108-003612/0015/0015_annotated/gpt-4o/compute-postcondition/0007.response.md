Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'. The if-else block covers all scenarios of `a`, `b`, and `c` being integers, ensuring that the correct message is displayed based on the conditions met or not met, addressing edge cases where the program appropriately handles the input values.***
