Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is met, the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'. The if-else block covers all scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, ensuring that the correct message is displayed based on the conditions satisfied or not satisfied.***
