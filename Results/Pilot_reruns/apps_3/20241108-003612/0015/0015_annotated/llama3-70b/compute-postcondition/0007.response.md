Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, then 'NO' is printed. In the case where `c` is not equal to 0, if the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then the program prints 'YES'. If this condition is not met, the program prints 'NO'. This postcondition ensures that all possible scenarios are covered, including the specific cases of `c` being 0, `a` being equal to `b`, the divisibility of the difference between `b` and `a` by `c`, and the non-negativity of the quotient.***
