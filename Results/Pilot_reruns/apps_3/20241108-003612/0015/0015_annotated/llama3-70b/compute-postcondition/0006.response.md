Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. The program handles all cases where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the quotient is non-negative, ensuring a clear output of either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions.***
