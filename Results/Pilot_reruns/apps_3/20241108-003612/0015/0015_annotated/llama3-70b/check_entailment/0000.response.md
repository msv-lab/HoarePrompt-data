Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by checking if Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence based on the given conditions. It handles the cases where the difference between neighboring elements is zero and where it is non-zero. The program outputs "YES" if Vasya's favorite number is part of the sequence and "NO" if it is not. The code annotations provide an overview of the logic flow and conditions being checked, which align with the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are covered by the program and produce the expected outputs.
