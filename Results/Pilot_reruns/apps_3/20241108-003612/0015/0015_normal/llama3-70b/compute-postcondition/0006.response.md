Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This accounts for all possible scenarios where the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` meet the stated conditions, ensuring the program handles all edge cases appropriately.***
