Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. If `c` is equal to 0, the program checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, the program verifies the conditions (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0. If these conditions are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures that `a`, `b`, and `c` maintain their integer values within the specified range after the execution of the if-else block.***
