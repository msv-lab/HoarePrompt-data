Example Answer: 
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints out the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as integer values within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` remain as integer values within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
