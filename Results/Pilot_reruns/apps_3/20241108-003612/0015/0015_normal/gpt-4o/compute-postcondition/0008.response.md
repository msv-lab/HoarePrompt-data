The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return the sum of squares of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, i.e., `a^2 + b^2 + c^2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of squares of integers a, b, and c and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of squares of integers a, b, and c and returns the result.**
