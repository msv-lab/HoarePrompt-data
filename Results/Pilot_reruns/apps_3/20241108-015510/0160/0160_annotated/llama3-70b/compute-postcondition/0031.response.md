Functionality: The function takes user input for integers N and K, as well as a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in list A. After finding the gcd, it computes the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function does not have a return value.
