Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list A, K is based on user input, A is a list of integers based on user input, max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between max_divisor and gcd // i where i is 1, and int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 is greater than 1. If gcd % i is equal to 0, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and i. Additionally, if i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is further updated to the maximum value between its current value and gcd divided by i.***
