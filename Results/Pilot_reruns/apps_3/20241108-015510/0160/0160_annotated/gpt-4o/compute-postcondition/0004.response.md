Postcondition: ***`divisors` is an empty set and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`. The postcondition covers all possible cases after the execution of the if statement, ensuring that `divisors` is updated with the appropriate divisors of `x`***
