Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i` and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The previous value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains the value of `i` and the result of `x // i` added to it.
Output State: **`divisors` contains the value of `i` and the result of `x // i` added to it**
