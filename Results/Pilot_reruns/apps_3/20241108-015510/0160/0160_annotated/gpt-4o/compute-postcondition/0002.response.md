Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The previous state of the set `divisors` is empty, and the value of `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After the code execution, the set `divisors` will contain the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` contains the value of `i`, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
