The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` now contains the updated values. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the updated values, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is less than the square root of `x`**
