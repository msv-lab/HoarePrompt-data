According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is an empty set and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is in the range of 1 to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`divisors` is an empty set and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`**
