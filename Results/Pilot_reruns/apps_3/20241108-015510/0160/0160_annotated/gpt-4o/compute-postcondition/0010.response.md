Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is less than the square root of `x`, the set `divisors` now contains `i` as one of its elements. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the value of `i`, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is less than the square root of `x`**
