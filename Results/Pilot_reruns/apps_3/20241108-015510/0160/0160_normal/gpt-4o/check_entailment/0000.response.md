After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, I believe the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the given list. It iterates through the list and updates the GCD accordingly using the `math.gcd` function. If the list has only one element, the function returns that element as the GCD, which aligns with the problem description.
2. The `func_2` function correctly finds all the divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in reverse order. The function handles the case where `x` is not a perfect square by returning an empty set. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
3. The main part of the code correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of elements in list A, calculates the GCD of list A using `func_1`, finds the divisors using `func_2`, and then iterates through the divisors to check if it can divide every element of A after the operations. The code uses all the necessary functions and logic to find the correct result based on the problem description.

Overall, the code seems to cover all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
