According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, the divisors list contains the newly added integer x // i if x % i == 0, where i is a divisor of x that is a perfect square. There exists at least one more perfect square divisor for x that has not been covered in the previous iteration.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `i` should be such that there exists another perfect square divisor of `x` that has not been covered yet.
2. The divisors list should be updated with the newly added integer x // i for this additional perfect square divisor.

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N. After the execution of the program fragment, divisors contains the newly added integer x // i if x % i == 0, where i is a divisor of x, which is a perfect square. There exists at least one more perfect square divisor for x that has not been covered in the previous iterations, considering all possible cases and edge cases involving the perfect square divisors of x.**
