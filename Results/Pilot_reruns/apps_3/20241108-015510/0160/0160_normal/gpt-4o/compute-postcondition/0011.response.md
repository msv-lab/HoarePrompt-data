Example Answer:
The program fragment adds the value `x // i` to the set `divisors` if `x % i == 0`, where `i` is a perfect square divisor of `x`. This addition implies that a new perfect square divisor has been covered. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A_i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, and divisors contains the newly added integer x // i if x % i == 0, where i is a divisor of x, which is a perfect square. There exists at least one more perfect square divisor for x that has not been covered in the previous iteration.
