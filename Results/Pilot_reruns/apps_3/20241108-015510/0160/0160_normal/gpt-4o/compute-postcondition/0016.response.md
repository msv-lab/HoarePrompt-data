The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 500. After the loop executes, the function will populate a set named `divisors` with all the divisors of `x` if `x` is a perfect square. If `x` is not a perfect square, the loop will not execute and `divisors` will remain an empty set. The function returns a sorted `divisors` set in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer `x`, find all the divisors of `x` if `x` is a perfect square, and return the sorted divisors set in reverse order.
