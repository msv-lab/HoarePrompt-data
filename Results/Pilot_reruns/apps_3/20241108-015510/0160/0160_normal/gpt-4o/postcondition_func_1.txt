The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x`, where 2 <= x <= 500. It then finds all the divisors of x if x is a perfect square and returns a sorted set of these divisors in reverse order. If x is not a perfect square, the function will return an empty set. The code accurately populates the set `divisors` with divisors of x and returns them sorted in reverse order.
