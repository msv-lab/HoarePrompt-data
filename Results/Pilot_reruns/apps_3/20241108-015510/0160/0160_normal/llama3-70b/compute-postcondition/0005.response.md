According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `K` is 0 or greater, `A` is a list of integers with at least one element, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current `gcd` and the integer at index `i` in list `A`, `i` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `N` needs to be at least 3 to satisfy the range condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is at least 3, `K` is 0 or greater, `A` is a list of integers with at least one element, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current `gcd` and the integer at index `i` in list `A`, `i` is increased by 2**
