Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A, max_divisor is the maximum value between the initial gcd and i. If gcd is divisible by i, the max_divisor is updated to the maximum between the current max_divisor and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum between the current max_divisor and the result of dividing gcd by i. The program ensures the integrity of the initial state variables N, K, A, gcd, and max_divisor, covering all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
