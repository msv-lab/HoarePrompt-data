Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A, and max_divisor is updated based on the comparison with integer `i`. If `i` squared is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of gcd divided by `i`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
