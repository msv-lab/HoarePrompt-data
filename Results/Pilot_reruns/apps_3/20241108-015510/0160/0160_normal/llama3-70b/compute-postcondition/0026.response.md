Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A. If gcd % i is equal to 0, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and gcd divided by i. In all cases, i is updated to the next value in the range.***
