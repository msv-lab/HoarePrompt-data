Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A, max_divisor is the maximum between the initial gcd and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum between the current max_divisor and the result of dividing gcd by i. In all cases, the program ensures the integrity of the initial state variables N, K, A, gcd, and max_divisor.***
