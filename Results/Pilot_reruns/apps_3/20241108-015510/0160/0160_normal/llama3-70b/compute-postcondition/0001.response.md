Example Answer: 
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The input is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
