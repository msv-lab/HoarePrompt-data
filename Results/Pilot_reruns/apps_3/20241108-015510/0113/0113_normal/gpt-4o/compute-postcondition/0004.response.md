Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates the value of `multiplier` based on the value of `k` (multiplier values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000) and then computes the result `x` as the product of `n` and `multiplier`. The function returns the calculated value of `x`.**
