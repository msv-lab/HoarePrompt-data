The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the function calculates the value of `multiplier` based on the value of `k` (multiplier values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000), and then calculates the result `x` as the product of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the appropriate multiplier based on the value of `k`, and return the result `x` as the product of `n` and the calculated multiplier.
