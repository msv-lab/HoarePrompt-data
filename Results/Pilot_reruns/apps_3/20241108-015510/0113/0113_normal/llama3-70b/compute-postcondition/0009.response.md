Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the value of `n`. If `n` is not initially divisible by `x`, it will keep increasing until it is divisible by `x`. The value of `k` remains the same throughout the process. 
Output State: **`n` is divisible by `x` and remains the same, `k` remains the same as well.**
