Example Answer: 
`n` is increased by 1, so if the initial value of `n` was increased by 2, the new value of `n` is increased by 3. `k` remains the same. The value of `x` is adjusted to ensure `n % x != 0`, which means that `x` must be a number other than 1 or `n`. Therefore, `x` is adjusted accordingly to meet this condition. 
Output State: **`n` is increased by 3, `k` remains the same, `x` is adjusted to meet the condition `n % x != 0`**
