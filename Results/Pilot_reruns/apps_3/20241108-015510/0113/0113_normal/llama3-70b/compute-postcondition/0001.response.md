Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`, where `k` can be any value from 0 to 8. Therefore, the value of `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
