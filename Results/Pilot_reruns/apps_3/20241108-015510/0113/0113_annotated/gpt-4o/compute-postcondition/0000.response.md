Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8. The value of `k` determines the value of `multiplier`, which is 10 raised to the power of `k`. The output state will depend on the specific value of `k` provided in the initial state.
Output State: **`multiplier` is 1 if k is 0, 10 if k is 1, 100 if k is 2, 1000 if k is 3, 10000 if k is 4, 100000 if k is 5, 1000000 if k is 6, 10000000 if k is 7, 100000000 if k is 8**
