The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the function calculates the `multiplier` based on the value of `k`. The value of `multiplier` is 1 if k is 0, 10 if k is 1, 100 if k is 2, 1000 if k is 3, 10000 if k is 4, 100000 if k is 5, 1000000 if k is 6, 10000000 if k is 7, and 100000000 if k is 8. The function then calculates `x` as the result of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` where `math.gcd` calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the appropriate `multiplier` based on the value of `k`, and then calculate `x` based on the formula mentioned above.
