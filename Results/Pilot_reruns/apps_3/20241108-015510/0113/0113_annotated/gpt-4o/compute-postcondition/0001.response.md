Output State: `multiplier` is 1 if k is 0, 10 if k is 1, 100 if k is 2, 1000 if k is 3, 10000 if k is 4, 100000 if k is 5, 1000000 if k is 6, 10000000 if k is 7, 100000000 if k is 8; `x` is the result of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` where `math.gcd` calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
