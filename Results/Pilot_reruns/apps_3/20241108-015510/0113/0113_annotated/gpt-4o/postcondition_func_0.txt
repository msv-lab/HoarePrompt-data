The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the `multiplier` based on the value of `k`, where `multiplier` is 1 if k is 0, 10 if k is 1, 100 if k is 2, and so on up to 100000000 if k is 8. Then, it computes `x` as the result of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` where `math.gcd` finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The function returns the calculated value of `x`. However, the annotations specify the calculation of `x` considers the greatest common divisor, but the actual code does not include an import statement for the `math` module. This missing functionality should be noted.
