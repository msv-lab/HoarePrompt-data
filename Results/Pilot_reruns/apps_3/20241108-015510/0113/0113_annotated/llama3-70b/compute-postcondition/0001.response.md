Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. Since `k` can be any non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` will be calculated as 10 to the power of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`**
