Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the new value of `n` will be the previous value incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`, which remains the same as `k` is unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`**
