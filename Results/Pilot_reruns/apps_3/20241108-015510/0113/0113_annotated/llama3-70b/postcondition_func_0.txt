The function `func` reads two inputs `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. It calculates the smallest positive integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then prints this calculated integer.
