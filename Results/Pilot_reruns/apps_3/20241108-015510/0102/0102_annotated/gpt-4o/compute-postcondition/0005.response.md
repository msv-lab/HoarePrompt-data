Example Answer:
The code snippet returns the element at index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, the value of `n` will be between 0 and 9. Therefore, the output state is `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the element at index `n` in the list `tens`.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the element at index `n` in the list `tens`**
