Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n` of the list `ones`. Since `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, the function returns the value at index `s` of the list `ones`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the value at index `s` of the list `ones`.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the value at index `s` of the list `ones`**
