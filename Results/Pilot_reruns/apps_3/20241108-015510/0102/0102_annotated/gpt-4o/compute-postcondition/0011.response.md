The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. After executing the function body, if 0 <= s <= 9, the function returns the element at index `s` in the list `ones`. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the element at index `s - 10` in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index `s // 10` in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices `s // 10` in `tens` and `s % 10` in `ones` separated by a hyphen. For all other cases where `s` is outside the range of 0 <= s <= 99 or the specific conditions are not met, the function does not return anything. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the range of 0 to 99 and return specific elements based on the conditions mentioned above.
