You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the element at index s - 10 in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index s // 10 in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices s // 10 in `tens` and s % 10 in `ones` separated by a hyphen.

If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index s // 10 in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices s // 10 in `tens` and s % 10 in `ones` separated by a hyphen. For all other cases where s is outside the range of 10 <= s <= 99 or s % 10 != 0, the function does not return anything.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. If 0 <= s <= 9, the function returns the element at index `s` in the list `ones`. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the element at index `s - 10` in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index `s // 10` in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices `s // 10` in `tens` and `s % 10` in `ones` separated by a hyphen. For all other cases where `s` is outside the range of 0 <= s <= 99 or the specific conditions are not met, the function does not return anything.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. After executing the function body, if 0 <= s <= 9, the function returns the element at index `s` in the list `ones`. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the element at index `s - 10` in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index `s // 10` in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices `s // 10` in `tens` and `s % 10` in `ones` separated by a hyphen. For all other cases where `s` is outside the range of 0 <= s <= 99 or the specific conditions are not met, the function does not return anything. 
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the range of 0 to 99 and return specific elements based on the conditions mentioned above.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
