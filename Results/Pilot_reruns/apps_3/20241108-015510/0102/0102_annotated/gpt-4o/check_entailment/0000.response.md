Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes an integer input `s` representing Tavas's score and returns the corresponding English word representation of the score as per the problem description. The implementation covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The code handles single-digit numbers, teens, and multiples of ten correctly, producing the expected word representations. The annotations also align with the code logic and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Therefore, the code is correct.
