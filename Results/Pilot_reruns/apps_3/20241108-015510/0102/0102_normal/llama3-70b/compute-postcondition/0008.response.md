Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s < 10, the function prints the string value corresponding to the number in the ones list at index s. If s is between 10 and 19, the function prints the string value corresponding to the number in the teens list at index (s - 10). If s is 20 or greater, the function prints the combination of the string value from the tens list at index (s // 10) and the string value from the ones list at index (s % 10). The function handles boundary cases and edge cases where s is exactly 10, 19, 20, 90, and other in-between values effectively.***
