Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately converts the integer score input into its corresponding word representation as per the problem description. It considers the cases where the input is a single digit, in the teens range, or a multiple of ten. The code handles these cases effectively and provides the correct output for all potential inputs within the specified range (0 to 99). The output hints also confirm that the code meets the requirements and correctly converts the integer scores into words. Thus, the code is correct.
