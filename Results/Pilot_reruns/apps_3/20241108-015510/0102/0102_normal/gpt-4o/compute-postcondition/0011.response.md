The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer between 0 and 99. Based on the value of `n`, the function returns the word representation of the number as described in the output postcondition. The function covers all possible cases for converting the given number `n` to its word representation, including edge cases at the boundaries and ensuring the correct representation for all two-digit numbers between 10 and 99 inclusively.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` and returns the word representation of the number based on the given conditions.**
