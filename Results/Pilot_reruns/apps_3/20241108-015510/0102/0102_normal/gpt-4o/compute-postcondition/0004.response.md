Example Answer:
The code returns the word equivalent of the number `n` after subtracting 10. Since `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, the output state is: `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine, and the function returns the word equivalent of the number `n - 10`.
Output State: **`ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine, and the function returns the word equivalent of the number `n - 10`**
