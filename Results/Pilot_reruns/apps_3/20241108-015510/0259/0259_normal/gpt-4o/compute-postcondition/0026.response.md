Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are known and unchanged. After calculation, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged, `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
