Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It calculates the minimum waiting time among all bus routes based on the time Serval goes to the station and the bus route schedules. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. If `n` is positive, the function determines the route index with the minimum waiting time and returns that index.**
