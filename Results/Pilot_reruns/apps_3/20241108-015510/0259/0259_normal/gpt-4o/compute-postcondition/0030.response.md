Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The program correctly handles all edge cases related to the wait time calculation. `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`.**
