According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions described in the postcondition, `chosen_route` is updated as well, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the i-th bus route, and `d_i` is the destination of the i-th bus route. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted where `i` is incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of the i-th bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the i-th bus route**
