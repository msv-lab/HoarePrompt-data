Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the ith tuple in the `bus_routes` list. The variables `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged**
