Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` remain unchanged. `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of the 1st bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the 1st bus route. If the condition `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` is true, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which covers all possible scenarios when determining the waiting time for the bus route.***
