The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. If `n` is positive, `min_wait_time` will be the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` will be the route index with the minimum waiting time, and the function returns `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus route tuples. It then calculates the minimum waiting time among all bus routes and returns the index of the route with the minimum waiting time.
