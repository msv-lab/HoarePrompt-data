Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The value of `wait_time` is now 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged, `wait_time` is 0**
