Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values based on the user input through `input().split()`. The `map` function converts the input values to integers and assigns them to `n` and `t`. The final values of `n` and `t` depend on the user input and cannot be determined in advance.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned values based on user input**
