Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` contains `n` tuples based on user input, `s` and `d` are integers based on user input. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity. `ans` is assigned -1.**
