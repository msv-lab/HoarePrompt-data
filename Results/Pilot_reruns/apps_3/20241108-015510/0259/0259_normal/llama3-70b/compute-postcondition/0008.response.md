According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `_` which is set to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `t`, `buses`, `s`, and `d` are based on user input. To execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` contains two tuples based on user input, `s` and `d` are based on user input, `_` is 2**
