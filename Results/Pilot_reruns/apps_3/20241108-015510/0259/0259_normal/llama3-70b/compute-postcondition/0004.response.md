Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are based on user input, and `buses` being an empty list initially, will now contain one tuple corresponding to the user input values of `s` and `d`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` contains one tuple based on user input, `s` and `d` are based on user input**
