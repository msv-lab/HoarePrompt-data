Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop iterates through the tuples in buses, calculates the time based on user input values of t, s, and d, updates min_time to the minimum time value calculated, and updates ans to the index of the minimum time plus 1. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and buses remains an empty list.**
