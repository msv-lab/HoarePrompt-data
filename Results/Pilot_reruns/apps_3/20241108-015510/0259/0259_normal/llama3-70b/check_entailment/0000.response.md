Correctness: **True**

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. The code reads the input for the number of bus routes and the target time, then reads the input for the start and duration of each bus trip. It calculates the minimum time difference between the target time and the arrival time of each bus, and prints the index of the bus with the minimum time difference plus 1. The code follows the problem description for all cases, and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, further confirming its correctness.
