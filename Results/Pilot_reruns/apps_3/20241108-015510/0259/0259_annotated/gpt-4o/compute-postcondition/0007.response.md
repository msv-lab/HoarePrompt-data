Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then the wait_time is 0. Otherwise, the wait_time is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This accounts for all scenarios where the wait_time is determined based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
