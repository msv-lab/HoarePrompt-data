Example Answer:
The wait_time is calculated based on the difference between d_i and the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. The variables s_i and d_i are updated based on the tuple at index i in bus_routes. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop, and wait_time is calculated as mentioned above.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop, and wait_time is calculated based on the formula provided.**
