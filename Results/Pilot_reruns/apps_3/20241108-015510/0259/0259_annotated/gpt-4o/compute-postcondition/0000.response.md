Example Answer:
The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for other variables, the output state is: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity**.
