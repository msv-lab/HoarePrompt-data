Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `chosen_route`. The value of `chosen_route` was determined based on the conditions given in the initial state. If `n` is greater than 0 and `bus_routes` is not empty, `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0 or `bus_routes` is empty, `chosen_route` is -1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: If n is greater than 0 and bus_routes is not empty, min_wait_time is the minimum wait time among the routes, chosen_route is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If n is 0 or bus_routes is an empty list, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.
Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and bus_routes is not empty, min_wait_time is the minimum wait time among the routes, chosen_route is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If n is 0 or bus_routes is an empty list, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
