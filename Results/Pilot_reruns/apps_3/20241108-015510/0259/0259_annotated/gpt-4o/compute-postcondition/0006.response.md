Example Answer:
The wait time is calculated based on the destination `d_i` and the difference between the current time `t` and the source `s_i`. The wait time is then stored in the variable `wait_time`. The output state is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, and wait_time is the calculated wait time.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, and wait_time is the calculated wait time**
