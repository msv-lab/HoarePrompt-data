Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. The function then calculates the minimum wait time among the routes and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0 or `bus_routes` is an empty list, the function returns -1. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, the function will return the index of the first route encountered with that minimum wait time.**
