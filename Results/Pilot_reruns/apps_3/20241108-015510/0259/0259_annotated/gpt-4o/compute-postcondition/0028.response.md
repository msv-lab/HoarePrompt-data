Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop. s_i and d_i are updated based on the tuple at index i in bus_routes. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, then wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i is equal to 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the if-else block, ensuring proper computation and assignment of variables based on the conditions provided, including edge cases where the values of s_i, t, and d_i result in different outcomes for wait_time.***
