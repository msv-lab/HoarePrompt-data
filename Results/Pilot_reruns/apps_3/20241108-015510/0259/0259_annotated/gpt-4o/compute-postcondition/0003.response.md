Example Answer: 
`i` is the index of the chosen route in the list of bus_routes. The tuple at index `i` is unpacked into `s_i` and `d_i`, representing the source and destination of the chosen route. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are specific to the chosen route number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route**
