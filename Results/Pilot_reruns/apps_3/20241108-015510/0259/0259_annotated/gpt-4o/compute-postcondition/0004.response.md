Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated by subtracting `t` from `s_i`. Since `t` is a positive integer and `s_i` is the source of the chosen route, the resulting `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `t` and `s_i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, and wait_time is the calculated wait time based on the values of `t` and `s_i`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, and wait_time is the calculated wait time based on the values of `t` and `s_i`**
