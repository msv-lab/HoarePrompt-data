Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The length of the `buses` list increases by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+3` after appending the new tuple, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+3` after appending the new tuple, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
