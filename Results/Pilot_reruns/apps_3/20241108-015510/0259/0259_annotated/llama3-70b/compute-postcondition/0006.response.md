Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of `s` and `d` will be integers based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+2`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+2`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
