Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values `n` and `t`, then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` and stores them in a list `buses`. It calculates the minimum time for each bus to reach the destination based on the input values and prints the index of the bus with the minimum time. If `n` is 0, no buses are stored and no output is generated.**
