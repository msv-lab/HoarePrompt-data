Example Answer:
`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `buses` is a list of length `n`, and `s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The input is split by spaces, and the map function converts the split values to integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n`, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n`, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer**
