Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list with at least 2 elements. `min_time` is the minimum value between the current `min_time` and the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`. `ans` is the index of the bus that has the minimum time (`i + 1`). `i` is incremented by 1. `s` is updated to the first element of the second tuple in `buses`. `d` is updated to the second element of the second tuple in `buses`. `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.***
