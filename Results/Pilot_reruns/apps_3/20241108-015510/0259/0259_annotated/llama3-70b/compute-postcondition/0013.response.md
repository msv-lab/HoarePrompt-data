Example Answer:
min_time is assigned the value float('inf'), which represents positive infinity. The loop has not executed yet, so buses remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: buses is an empty list, min_time is positive infinity.
Output State: **buses is an empty list, min_time is positive infinity**
