Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**
