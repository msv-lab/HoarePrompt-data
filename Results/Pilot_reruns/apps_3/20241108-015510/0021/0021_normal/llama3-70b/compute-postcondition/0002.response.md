Example Answer: 
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, and the index function returns the index of the first occurrence of the element, the position of 1 in the list `a` is stored in `pos1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, and `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, and `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`**
