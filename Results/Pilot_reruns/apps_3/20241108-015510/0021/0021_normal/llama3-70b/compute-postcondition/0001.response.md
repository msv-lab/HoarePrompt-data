Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `a` are distinct integers ranging from 1 to n. Since n is between 2 and 100, the elements of `a` are distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**.
