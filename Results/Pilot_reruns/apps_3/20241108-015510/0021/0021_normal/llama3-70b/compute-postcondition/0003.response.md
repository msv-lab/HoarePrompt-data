Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index` function. The value of `n` is one of the integers in list `a`, so `n` will always be found in `a`. Therefore, the index of `n` in list `a` is stored in `posn`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` stores the index of n in list `a`**
