Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
- It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the numbers 1 and n in the list and prints this maximum distance.
- The logic used to calculate the maximum distance by considering all possible positions of 1 and n in the list is correct.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
