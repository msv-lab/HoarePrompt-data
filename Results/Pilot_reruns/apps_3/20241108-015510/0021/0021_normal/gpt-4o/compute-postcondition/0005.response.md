Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos. The value of n is the number of distinct integers in `a`, and max_pos is n - 1. So, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and n - 1, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0.
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0**
