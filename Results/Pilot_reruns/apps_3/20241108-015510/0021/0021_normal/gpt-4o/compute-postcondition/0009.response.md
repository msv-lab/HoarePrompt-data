Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of `max_distance`, which is `n-1`. Since `max_distance` is already defined as `n-1` in the initial state, there are no changes to any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0; `dist4` is n - 1; `max_distance` is n-1.
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0; `dist4` is n - 1; `max_distance` is n-1**
