Example Answer:
The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of `n` would be n-1. Therefore, `max_pos` is assigned the value of n-1. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1**
