Example Answer:
`max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are provided as 0, 0, 0, and n-1 respectively. Therefore, the maximum value among them is n-1. Hence, after execution, `max_distance` is n-1.
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0; `dist4` is n - 1; `max_distance` is n-1**
