Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly finds the position of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculates the distance of each element from the start and end of the array. Then it calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by taking the maximum of the calculated distances. This approach ensures that the program always swaps the elements in a way that maximizes the distance between the minimum and maximum elements, as required by the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the maximum possible distance.
