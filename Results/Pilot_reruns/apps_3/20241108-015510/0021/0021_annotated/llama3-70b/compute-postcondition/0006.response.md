Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list `a` and stores it in `max_dist`. It also calculates the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list `a` and stores it in `min_dist`. Then it prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The initial state provides the necessary values to calculate `max_dist` and `min_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance, min_dist is the minimum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2, and the maximum value between max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist is printed.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance, min_dist is the minimum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2, and the maximum value between max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist is printed**
