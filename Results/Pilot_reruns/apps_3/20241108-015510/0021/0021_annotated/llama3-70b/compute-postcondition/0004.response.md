Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`. Since `pos1` and `posn` are the indices of 1 and n in list `a` respectively, the maximum distance between them can be calculated. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance**
