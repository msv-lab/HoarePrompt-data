The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (1 <= a_i <= n). The function does not have any explicit return value mentioned in the description.
