The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list, as well as the minimum distance. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance, `n` - 1, and the difference between `n` - 2 and the minimum distance. The function does not explicitly return any value.
