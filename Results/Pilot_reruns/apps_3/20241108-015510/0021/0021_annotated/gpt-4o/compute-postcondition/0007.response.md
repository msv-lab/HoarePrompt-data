Example Answer:
dist4 is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos. The previous values of n, min_pos, and dist4 are known. Therefore, dist4 will be calculated by taking the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos**
