Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The elements in list `a` are distinct integers from 1 to n, where each element `a_i` is equal to the element at the i-th position. The input state is `n` is an input integer. After execution, the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n where each element `a_i` is equal to the element at the i-th position.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n where each element a_i is equal to the element at the i-th position**
