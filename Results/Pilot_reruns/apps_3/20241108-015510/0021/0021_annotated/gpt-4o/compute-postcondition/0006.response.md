Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` is the index of the number 1 in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist3` represents the distance between the beginning of the list and the position of the number 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos**
