Example Answer: 
The code finds the index of the number 1 in the list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n where each element a_i is equal to the element at the i-th position, the index of the number 1 in the list `a` will be the minimum possible position. Therefore, `min_pos` will be the index of the number 1 in the list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n where each element a_i is equal to the element at the i-th position, `min_pos` is the index of the number 1 in the list `a`**
