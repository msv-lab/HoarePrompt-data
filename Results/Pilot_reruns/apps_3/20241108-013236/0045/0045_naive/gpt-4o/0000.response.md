Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in two integers `n` and `k` as input. It then calculates the minimum sum that can be achieved with the sequence of numbers, which is `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If the minimum sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the divisor `d` and the remainder. It creates a sequence of `k` numbers by multiplying each index by `d`, and then distributes the remainder among the numbers in the sequence. The program then prints the resulting sequence.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. If there is no possible sequence, it correctly outputs -1. For the given examples, it provides the correct sequences that meet the requirements. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
