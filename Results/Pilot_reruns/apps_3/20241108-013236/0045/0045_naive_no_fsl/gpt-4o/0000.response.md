Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by creating a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n. It calculates the minimum sum possible for k numbers and checks if it is greater than n. If so, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the divisor to distribute among the numbers and creates the sequence accordingly. The program handles the edge case of multiple answers by providing any valid sequence. The output is also formatted correctly. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
