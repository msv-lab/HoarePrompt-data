Example Answer:
The function returns -1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`**
