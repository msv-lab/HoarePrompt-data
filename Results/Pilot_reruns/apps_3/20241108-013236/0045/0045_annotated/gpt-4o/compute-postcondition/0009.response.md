Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation, `i` is `k - 1`; if the remainder after dividing n by `min_sum` is 0, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution; `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
