Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, and checks if this sum exceeds `n`. If the sum is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If the sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function then updates the values of `sequence`, `remainder`, and `k` until `remainder` reaches 0 by adjusting the values in the `sequence` list. Finally, the function returns the modified `sequence`.**
