Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is adjusted accordingly; `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1; `k` is decreased by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop.
