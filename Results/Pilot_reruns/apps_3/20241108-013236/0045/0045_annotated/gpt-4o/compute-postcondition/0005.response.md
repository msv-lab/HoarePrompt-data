Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying each element from 1 to `k` with `d`. The value of `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, where `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. The initial state variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation**
