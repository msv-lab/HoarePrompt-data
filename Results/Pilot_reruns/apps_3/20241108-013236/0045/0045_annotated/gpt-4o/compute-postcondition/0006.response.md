According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers, so they satisfy the condition. The loop will iterate from `k - 1` down to `0`, so the loop will execute `k` times. 
To adjust the state before the loop starts:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation, `i` is `k - 1`.**
