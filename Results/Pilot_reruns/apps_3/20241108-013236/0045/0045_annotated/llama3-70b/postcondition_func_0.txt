The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b. It iterates through a loop where a takes on the original value of b, and b takes on the remainder of the original a divided by the original b. This process continues until b becomes 0. The function then returns the final value of a. The function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the two input integers a and b.
