Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the original value of `b`, which is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. Since `b` is not equal to 0, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a` holds the original value of `b`, `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`**
