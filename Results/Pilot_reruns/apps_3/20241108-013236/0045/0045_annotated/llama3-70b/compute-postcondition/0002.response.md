Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so `a` now holds the original value of `b` and `b` now holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. Since `b` is not equal to 0, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`a` holds the original value of `b`, `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0**
