According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is a non-zero value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` holds the original value of `b`, and `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` holds the original value of `b`, `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`**
