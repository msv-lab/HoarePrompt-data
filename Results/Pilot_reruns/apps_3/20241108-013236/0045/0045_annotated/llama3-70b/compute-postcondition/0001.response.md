According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to be not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
