Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input n and k and checks if n is less than k, it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it creates a sequence of k numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until n is exhausted.
- If the sequence length is not k, it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it prints the sequence.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
