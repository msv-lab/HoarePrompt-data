Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. However, since the specific initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, the final values cannot be determined. It is only known that `b` evaluates to True. Therefore, the output state is: The specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined after the operation, `b` evaluates to True.
Output State: **The specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined after the operation, `b` evaluates to True**
