Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is truthy (non-zero). After swapping, `a` is assigned the value of the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so the exact values of `a` and `b` after the operation cannot be determined.
Output State: **The specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined after the operation**
