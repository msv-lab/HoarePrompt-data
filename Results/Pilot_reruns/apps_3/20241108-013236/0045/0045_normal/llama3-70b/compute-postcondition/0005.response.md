According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b` being True. At the end of the last iteration, `b` evaluates to True, so the loop can certainly execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined after the operation, `b` evaluates to True**
