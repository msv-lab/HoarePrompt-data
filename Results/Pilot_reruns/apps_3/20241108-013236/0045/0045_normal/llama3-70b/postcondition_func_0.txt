The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The loop within the function continues to execute until `b` evaluates to 0. After the loop finishes, `a` will contain the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0. If `b` is initially 0, the loop will not execute. The function then returns the value of `a`.
