Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`, where `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`. The value of `min_sum` is a positive integer and `d` is calculated based on this value. Therefore, the output state is: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`**
