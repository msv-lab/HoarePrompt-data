Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is at least 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
