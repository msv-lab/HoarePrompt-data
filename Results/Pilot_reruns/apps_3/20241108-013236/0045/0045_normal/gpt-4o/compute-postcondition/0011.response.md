According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `k - 1` to 0, the value of `i` should be `k - 2`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is at least 1**
