The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the resulting `min_sum` is a positive integer and it is greater than `n`, the function returns -1 to indicate an error. Otherwise, if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, then there is no change in the state of the program variables.

Case_2: If `k` is at least 1 and `remainder` is positive, the loop will execute and decrement `remainder` by 1 for `k` iterations. During each iteration, the `i-th` element of `sequence` will be incremented by 1. If at any point `remainder` becomes 0, the loop will break. If `k` is less than 1 or `remainder` is non-positive, the loop will not execute and the state of the program variables will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, either return -1 if an error occurs, or update the values of certain program variables through a loop if specific conditions are met.
