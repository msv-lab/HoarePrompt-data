Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, then the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder when dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed.***
