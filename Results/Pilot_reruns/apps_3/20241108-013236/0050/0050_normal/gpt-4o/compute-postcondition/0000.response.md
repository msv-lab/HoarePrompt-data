Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints**
