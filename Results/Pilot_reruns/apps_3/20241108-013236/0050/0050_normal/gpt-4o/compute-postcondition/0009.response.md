Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `total_bourles`. The value of `total_bourles` is calculated based on the initial state and the constraints provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder when dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated accordingly, and finally the value of `total_bourles` is printed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder when dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated accordingly, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed**
