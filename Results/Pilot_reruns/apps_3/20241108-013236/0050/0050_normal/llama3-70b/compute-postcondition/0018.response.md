Example Answer: 
`r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous value of `r` is unknown, and `s[i]` is also unknown, so the output state is: `n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r` is updated, `shares` is updated, `s`, `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r` is updated, `shares` is updated, `s`, `b` remain unchanged**
