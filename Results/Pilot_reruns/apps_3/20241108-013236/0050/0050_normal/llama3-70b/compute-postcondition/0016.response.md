According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n+1`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` are integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` remain unchanged**
