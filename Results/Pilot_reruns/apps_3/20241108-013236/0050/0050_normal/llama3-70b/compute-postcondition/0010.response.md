Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares` are positive integers based on user input; `s` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of m positive integers sorted in descending order. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], `shares` is updated to include the integer quotient of r divided by s[i], and r is updated to the remainder of the division. If r is less than s[i], the loop is terminated.***
