Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the result of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous values of variables are `n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r`, `shares` is updated, `s`, `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n+1` incremented by 1, `m`, `r`, `shares` is updated, `s`, `b` remain unchanged**
