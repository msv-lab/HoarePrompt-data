Example Answer:
The list `b` is populated by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `b` are unknown, and the new values are based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers based on user input; `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers based on user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers based on user input; `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers based on user input**
