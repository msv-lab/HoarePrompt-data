According to the code, the loop execution is based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value. Other states need to be maintained as they are unless affected by the loop body.
State: **`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain the same**
