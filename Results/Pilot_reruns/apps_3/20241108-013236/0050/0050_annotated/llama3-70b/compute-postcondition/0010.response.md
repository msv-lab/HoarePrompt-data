Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `b` is a list of integers created from user input split and sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element in `s`, `shares` is updated to the result of the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than the `i-th` element in `s`, `shares` remains 0 and the loop breaks. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
