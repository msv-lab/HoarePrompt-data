Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, which accepts multiple inputs and splits them based on spaces, converting them to integers. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are based on the input provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input**
