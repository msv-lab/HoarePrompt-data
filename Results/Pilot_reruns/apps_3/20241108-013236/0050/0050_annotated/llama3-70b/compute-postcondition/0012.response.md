Example Answer:
`shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` where `s[i]` is a specific value in the list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` is updated according to the calculation**
