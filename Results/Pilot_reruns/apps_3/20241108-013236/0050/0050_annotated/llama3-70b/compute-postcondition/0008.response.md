Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by the `i`-th element of list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `b` is a list of integers created from user input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is initialized to the result of the floor division of `r` by the first element of `s`**
