According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values, `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`, and `shares` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values, `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`, `shares` is updated accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1**
