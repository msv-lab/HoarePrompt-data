Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values. `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of shares and `b[i]`, and shares is set to 0. Otherwise, `n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values, `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`, `shares` is updated accordingly, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
