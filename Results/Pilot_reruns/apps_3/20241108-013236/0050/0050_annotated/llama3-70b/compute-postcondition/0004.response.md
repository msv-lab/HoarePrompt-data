Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. No new variables are introduced or affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split, and `b` is now sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split, and `b` is now sorted in reverse order**
