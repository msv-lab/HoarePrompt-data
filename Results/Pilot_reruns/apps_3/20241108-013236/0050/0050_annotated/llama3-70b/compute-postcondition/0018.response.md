Example Answer:
`r` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with `s[i]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than the current value, `m` is greater than the current value, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` is updated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than the current value, `m` is greater than the current value, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` is updated**
