Example Answer: 
A list `s` is created by mapping the input values to integers after splitting them. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, and `s` is a list of integers created from user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, and `s` is a list of integers created from user input**
