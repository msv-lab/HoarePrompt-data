Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current value, `m` is greater than the current value. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated by taking the modulo of `r` by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
