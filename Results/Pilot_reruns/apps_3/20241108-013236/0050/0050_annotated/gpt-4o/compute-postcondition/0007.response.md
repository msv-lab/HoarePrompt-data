Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the value `r % min_buy_price`, where `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `b`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum value in list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum value in list `b`**
