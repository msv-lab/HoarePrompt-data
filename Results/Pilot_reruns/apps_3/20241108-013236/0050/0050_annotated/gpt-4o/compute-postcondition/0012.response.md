Functionality: **The function func reads input values for integers n, m, r, a list of integers s, and another list of integers b. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list s and the maximum sell price from list b. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints r. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with r, the remaining amount of money, and the total amount of money after buying shares. The function then prints the total amount of money. The function does not have a specific return value.**
