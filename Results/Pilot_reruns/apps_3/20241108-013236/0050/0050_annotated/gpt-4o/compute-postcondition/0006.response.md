Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, but the value of `min_buy_price` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`**
