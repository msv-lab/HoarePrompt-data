Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. It then reads the prices of buying and selling shares into lists.
3. The program calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price from the input lists.
4. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial amount of bourles as the maximum amount that can be held after the evening.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and then calculates the total amount of bourles after selling all the shares bought at the maximum sell price.
6. The final output is the total amount of bourles.
7. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output based on the given input.
