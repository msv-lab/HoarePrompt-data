Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the number of bourles you hold.
2. The program sorts the buy and sell prices in ascending and descending order respectively, which is necessary for the optimal buying and selling strategy.
3. The program iterates through the buy prices and calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles.
4. The program then iterates through the sell prices and calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares bought earlier.
5. Finally, the program prints the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.
6. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the optimal buying and selling strategy is followed to maximize the bourles held after the evening.
