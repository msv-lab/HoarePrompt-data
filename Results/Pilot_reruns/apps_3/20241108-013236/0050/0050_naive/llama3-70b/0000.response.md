Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It first sorts the buy and sell prices in ascending and descending order respectively. Then, it iterates through the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible with the initial money. After that, it iterates through the sell prices to sell all the shares bought earlier. The final amount of money is printed, which represents the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs.
