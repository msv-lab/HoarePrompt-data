Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles and the remaining bourles. It then calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares at the maximum sell price. The logic follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
