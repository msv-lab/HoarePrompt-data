Example Answer:
`numerator` is updated by multiplying its current value with `(total_days - i) % MOD`, where `total_days` is calculated as 1 left-shifted by `n`. The previous values of `numerator` and other variables are 1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `numerator` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is 1**
