The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The MOD value is defined as 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n (k > 1 << n), then the program prints "1 1" and returns. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers n and k within the specified constraints, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints "1 1" and returns; otherwise, it maintains the program state unchanged. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k satisfying specific constraints and MOD value. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints "1 1" and returns; otherwise, it maintains the program state unchanged.**
