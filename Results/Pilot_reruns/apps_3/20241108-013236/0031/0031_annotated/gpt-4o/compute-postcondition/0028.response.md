Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k satisfying specific constraints along with a MOD value. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints "1 1" and returns without any further computation. Otherwise, it calculates values for total_days, numerator, and denominator based on the input parameters. It then computes p_no_shared, p_total, and p_shared. Next, it assigns values to A and B before calling another function func_1 with A and B as parameters, updating A and B accordingly. Finally, it prints the remainders of A and B modulo MOD. The function covers the case where k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, but it doesn't specify the actual purpose of the calculations or the role of func_1 in the operation.**
