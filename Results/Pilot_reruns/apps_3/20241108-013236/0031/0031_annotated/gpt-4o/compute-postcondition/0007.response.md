According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, if k > 1 << n, then the program prints "1 1" and returns, which means the loop will not execute. If k ≤ 1 << n, then the loop will execute. Adjust the state accordingly. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ 1 << n, `MOD` is 1000003,  total_days is 1 left-shifted by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
