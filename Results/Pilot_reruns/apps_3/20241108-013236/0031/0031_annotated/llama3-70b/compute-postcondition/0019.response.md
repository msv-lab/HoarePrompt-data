Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the inputs. Then, it computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`. After that, it returns the results of `numerator % (10^6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10^6 + 3)`. The functionality of the function is to perform these calculations and return the respective modulo results.**
