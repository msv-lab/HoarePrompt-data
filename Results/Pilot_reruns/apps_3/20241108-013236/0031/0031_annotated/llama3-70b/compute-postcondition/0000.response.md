Example Answer:
The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` can range from 1 to 10^18, the value of `total_days` can vary greatly. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
