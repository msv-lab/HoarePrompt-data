The function accepts two integer parameters a and b. It iteratively updates the values of a and b based on the Euclidean algorithm until b becomes 0. Then, it returns the final value of a. If b is 0 at the start, the function returns the initial value of a. If b evaluates to 0 during the loop execution, the function returns the current value of a.
