Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` will be updated based on the new value of `total_days`, `denominator` will be updated based on the new value of `total_days` modulo MOD. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1.**
