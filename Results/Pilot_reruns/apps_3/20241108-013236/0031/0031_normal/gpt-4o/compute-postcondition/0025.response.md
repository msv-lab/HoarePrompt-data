Example Answer:
`B` is updated by performing an integer division with `g`. The previous value of `B` is the value of `p_total`, and the value of `g` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is updated after integer division with `g`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is updated after integer division with `g`**
