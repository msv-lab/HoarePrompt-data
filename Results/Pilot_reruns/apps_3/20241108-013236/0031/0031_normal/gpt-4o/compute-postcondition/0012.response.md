Example Answer:
The value of 'denominator' is updated by multiplying the current value of 'denominator' with 'total_days' and then taking the result modulo MOD. The initial value of 'denominator' is calculated based on the initial value of 'total_days' modulo MOD. Therefore, after execution, the new value of 'denominator' is the previous value of 'denominator' multiplied by 'total_days' modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 1, and k is greater than 0**
