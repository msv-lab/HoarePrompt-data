The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition for `n` and `k` is that they are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the function prints 1, 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, it prints 1, 1. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, both integers. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1, 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state.**
