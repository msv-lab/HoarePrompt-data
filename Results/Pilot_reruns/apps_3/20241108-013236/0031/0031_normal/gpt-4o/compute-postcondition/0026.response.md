Example Answer:
`A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are printed. The values of `A` and `B` are not provided in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `B` is updated after integer division with `g`. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is updated after integer division with `g`; `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are printed.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is updated after integer division with `g`; `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are printed**
