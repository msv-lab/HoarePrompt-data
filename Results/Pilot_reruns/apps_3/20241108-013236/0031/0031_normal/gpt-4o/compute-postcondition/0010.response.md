According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 1, and k is greater than 0**
