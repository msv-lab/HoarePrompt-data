Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
- The function func_1 implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers, ensuring that the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction are coprime before taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The function func_2 handles the calculation of the probability fraction and prints the reduced fraction A/B modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The code accounts for the case when k is greater than 2^n by printing 1, 1, as it is guaranteed that at least two people will share the same birthday in that scenario.
- The code correctly calculates the probability fraction for all other valid cases where k is less than or equal to 2^n.
