Example Answer: 
`denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `denominator` is now 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
