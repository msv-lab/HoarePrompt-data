According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of (`total_days` * (`total_days` - 1)), `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days` squared, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of (`total_days` * (`total_days` - 1)), `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days` squared, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
