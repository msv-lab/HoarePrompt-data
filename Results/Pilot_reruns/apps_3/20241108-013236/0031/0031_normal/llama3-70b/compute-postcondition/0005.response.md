Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is the same as updating `denominator` to the value of `total_days`. Since `total_days` is between 2 and 2^10^18, `denominator` is updated to the same value, and other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
