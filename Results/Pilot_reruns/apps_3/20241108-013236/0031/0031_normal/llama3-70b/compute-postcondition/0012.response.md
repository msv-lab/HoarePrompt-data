According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to (`total_days` * (`total_days` - 1)) * (`total_days` - 2), `denominator` is updated to `total_days` cubed, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to (`total_days` * (`total_days` - 1)) * (`total_days` - 2), `denominator` is updated to `total_days` cubed, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
