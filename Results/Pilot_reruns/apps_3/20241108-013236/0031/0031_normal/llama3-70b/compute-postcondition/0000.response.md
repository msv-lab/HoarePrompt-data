Example Answer:
The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of 2 to the power of `n`. Since `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `total_days` can range from 2 to 2^10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18.
Output State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18**
