Example Answer:
`numerator` is divided in place by `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are determined by the value of `k`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values**
