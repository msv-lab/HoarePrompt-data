Example Answer: 
The `denominator` is divided by the `gcd`, updating the `denominator` value. The `numerator` and `gcd` values are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values, and the `denominator` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values, and the `denominator` is updated accordingly**
