Example Answer: 
The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are determined based on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` will be the product of `total_days` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days` - 2) ... up to k, while `denominator` will be `total_days` raised to the power of k. If `k` is 0 or negative, `numerator` remains 1, and `denominator` remains 1. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values**
