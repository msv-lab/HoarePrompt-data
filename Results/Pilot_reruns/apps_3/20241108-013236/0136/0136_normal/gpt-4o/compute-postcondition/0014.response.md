Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. If `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. After the execution of the program fragment, if `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The postcondition covers all cases where `a` and `b` are valid non-negative integers represented as strings, including the scenario where both `a` and `b` are '0'.***
