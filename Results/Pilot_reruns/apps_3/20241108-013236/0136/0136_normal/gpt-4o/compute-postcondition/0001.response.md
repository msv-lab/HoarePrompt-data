Example Answer:
The code snippet `a = data[0].lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeros from the string stored at index 0 of the list `data` and assigns the result to variable `a`. If `data[0]` contains only zeros, `a` will be assigned the value '0'. The values of `b` and other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
