The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. The function operates on two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which are represented as strings containing at most 10^6 digits each. The function returns the result of some operation on `a` and `b`, but the specific operation is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform an operation on two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, represented as strings, and return the result of that operation.
