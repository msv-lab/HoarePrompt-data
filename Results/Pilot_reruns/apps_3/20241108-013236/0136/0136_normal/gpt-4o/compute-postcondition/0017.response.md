Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integer values `a` and `b` represented as strings without leading zeros. It then performs an unspecified operation on these values and prints either '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison result. If `a` or `b` is an empty string, it assigns '0' to the corresponding value. The function does not explicitly state the operation being performed or the criteria for comparison.**
