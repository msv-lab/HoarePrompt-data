Example Answer:
The input is split into a list called `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly assigned, but they are split into `data`. Therefore, the output state is `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings split into `data`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings split into `data`**
