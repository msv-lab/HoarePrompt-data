Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two non-negative integer values `a` and `b` represented as strings without leading zeros. It then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`, if they are not equal it prints '<' or '>', otherwise it compares the actual values of `a` and `b` and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly. The code correctly handles the case where one of the numbers is '0' or empty string by converting it to '0'. The comparison logic also seems correct as it first compares the lengths and then the actual values. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code.
