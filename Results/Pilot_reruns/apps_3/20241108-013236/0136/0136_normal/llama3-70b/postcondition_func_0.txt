The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input, each with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
