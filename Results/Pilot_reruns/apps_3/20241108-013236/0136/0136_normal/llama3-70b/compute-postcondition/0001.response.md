Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the input with leading zeros removed using lstrip('0'). As `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, the value of `b` will be the same as `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is the same as `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is the same as `a`**
