Correctness: True

The code takes two very long integers as input, removes any leading zeros, compares their lengths, and then compares the actual values of the integers to determine which one is greater or if they are equal. The code correctly handles cases where the input integers contain leading zeros and where the input integers are equal in value. The code also uses the correct symbols ("<", ">", "=") to represent the comparison results as required by the problem description. Overall, the code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the expected output.
