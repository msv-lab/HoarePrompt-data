Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '>' is printed. If `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. The program ensures that `a` and `b` are correctly updated and compared, handling cases where `a` and/or `b` are empty strings and assigning them the value '0' accordingly.***
