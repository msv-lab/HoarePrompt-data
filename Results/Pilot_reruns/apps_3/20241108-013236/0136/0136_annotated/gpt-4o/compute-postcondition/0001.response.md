Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip` function. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` will be the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros. The variable `b` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`a` is the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros, `b` remains the same**
