Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros. If `a` is empty, then it is assigned the value '0'. `b` is updated based on `data[1]` without leading zeros. If `b` is empty, then `b` is assigned the value '0'. If `a` is greater than `b`, then '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, then '=' is printed. The program ensures that `a` and `b` are correctly updated and compared, handling cases where `a` and/or `b` are empty strings and assigning them the value '0' accordingly.***
