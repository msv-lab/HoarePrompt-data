Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. Otherwise, the program prints '>'. This covers all possible scenarios where `a` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `b`.***
