Functionality: **The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from the user input. It then compares `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input.**
