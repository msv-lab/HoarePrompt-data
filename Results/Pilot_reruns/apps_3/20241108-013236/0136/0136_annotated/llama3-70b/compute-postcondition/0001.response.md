Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing leading zeros. The input is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, so the leading zeros are removed. The variable `a` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros**
