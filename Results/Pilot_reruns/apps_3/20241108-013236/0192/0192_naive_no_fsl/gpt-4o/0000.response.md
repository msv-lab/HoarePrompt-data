Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The program follows the problem description by first taking the input of x and y, then calculating the minimum number of seconds required using the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). The logic of the program is sound and it covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
