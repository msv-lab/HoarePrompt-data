Example Answer: 
The expression calculates half of the difference between x and y and adds the remainder of the division by 2. Since x is always greater than y, the result will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer greater than y with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 100,000; y is an integer less than x with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 99,999, and the calculated value is the result of the expression.
