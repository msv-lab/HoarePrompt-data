Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. It does so by calculating the difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and adding the remainder of the division. This logic aligns with the problem description, as it ensures that the resulting triangle has side lengths that are integers and maintains the triangle's non-degeneracy. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the output produced by the code. Thus, the code is correct for all potential cases.
