Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are taken as input and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `x` and `y` must satisfy the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
