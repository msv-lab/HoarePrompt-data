Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed using the `abs()` function. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the absolute difference between `x` and `y` will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between them is printed.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between them is printed**
