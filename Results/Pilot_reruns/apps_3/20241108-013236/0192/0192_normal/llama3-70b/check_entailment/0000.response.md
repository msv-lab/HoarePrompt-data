Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, ensuring that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. It then prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. The code correctly calculates this minimum number of seconds by finding the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description match the output of the code. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
