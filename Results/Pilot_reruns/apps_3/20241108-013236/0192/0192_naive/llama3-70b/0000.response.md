Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths, then calculates the absolute difference between the two lengths and prints it. This logic correctly determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. 
For all potential cases and given examples, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output.
