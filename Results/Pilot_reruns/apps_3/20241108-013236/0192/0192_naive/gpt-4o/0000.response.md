Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x. 

The formula used in the program to calculate the minimum number of seconds is derived from the observation that in each second, Memory can reduce the side length of the triangle by 1 until it reaches the desired side length. The formula used is ((x - y) // 2) + (x - y) % 2, which correctly captures this logic.

For all potential cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform the equilateral triangle from side length x to side length y. Thus, the program is correct for all inputs and follows the problem description.
