Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly when the first and last occurrence of the given character are the same. In this case, the program will remove the character, but it will also remove the characters between the first and last occurrence, which is not the expected behavior.

For example, if the input is `func_1("hello", "l")`, the program will return `"heo"`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `"helo"`.

The issue is with the line `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]`. When `first_occ` and `last_occ` are the same, this line will remove the character and the characters between the first and last occurrence.

To fix this issue, the program should check if `first_occ` and `last_occ` are the same, and if so, only remove the first occurrence of the character.
