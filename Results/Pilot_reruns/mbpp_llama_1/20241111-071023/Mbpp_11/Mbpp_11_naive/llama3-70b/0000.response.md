Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the first and last occurrence of the given character are the same. In this case, the program will remove all occurrences of the character, not just the first and last one. For example, if the input string is "aaa" and the character is "a", the program will return an empty string, whereas it should return "aa". 

In the line where the string is being sliced, `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]` will be an empty string when `first_occ` is equal to `last_occ`, and therefore all occurrences of the character will be removed. To fix this, the program should handle the case where `first_occ` is equal to `last_occ` separately.
