The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` occurs not more than once, or a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones removed if `ch` occurs more than once. If `s` is empty or `ch` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string or raises a `ValueError`, respectively. If `s` contains only one character, which is `ch`, the function returns an empty string.
