The function returns `s`, and `s` is a string. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and the function returns `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and the function returns `s`.**
