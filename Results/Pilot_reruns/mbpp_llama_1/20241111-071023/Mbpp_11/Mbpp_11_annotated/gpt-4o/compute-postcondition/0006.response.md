Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. The function's behavior is determined by the occurrences of `ch` in `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the function's behavior:

1. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns `s` as is. This is specified in the annotations and is consistent with the code.
2. If `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, the function removes all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones. This is specified in the annotations and is consistent with the code.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic to consider:

* If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string, as there are no occurrences of `ch` to remove.
* If `ch` is an empty string, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the index of `ch` in `s`, as an empty string is not a valid character.
* If `s` contains only one character, which is `ch`, the function will return an empty string, as the only occurrence of `ch` is removed.

Considering these edge cases and the code's behavior, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` occurs not more than once, or a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones removed if `ch` occurs more than once. If `s` is empty or `ch` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string or raises a `ValueError`, respectively. If `s` contains only one character, which is `ch`, the function returns an empty string. **
