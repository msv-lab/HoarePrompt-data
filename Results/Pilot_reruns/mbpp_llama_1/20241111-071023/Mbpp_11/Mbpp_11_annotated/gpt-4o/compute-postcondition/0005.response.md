The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string, and `ch` is a string of length 1, which is a character that appears at least once in `s`. 

After executing the function body, the function's return value depends on the occurrence of `ch` in `s`. 

Case_1: If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns `s` as is. 

Case_2: If `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, the function returns a modified string where all occurrences of `ch` except possibly the first and last ones are removed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return either the original string `s` if `ch` occurs not more than once, or a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones removed if `ch` occurs more than once.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` occurs not more than once, or a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones removed if `ch` occurs more than once.**
