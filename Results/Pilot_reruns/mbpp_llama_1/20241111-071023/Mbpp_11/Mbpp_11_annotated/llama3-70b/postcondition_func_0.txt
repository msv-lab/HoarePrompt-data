The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns a string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed, and the part between them (excluding the first and last occurrences) if `c` is found in `s`, otherwise returns the original string `s`. Note that this does not remove all occurrences of `c` from the string `s`, but only the first and last ones.
