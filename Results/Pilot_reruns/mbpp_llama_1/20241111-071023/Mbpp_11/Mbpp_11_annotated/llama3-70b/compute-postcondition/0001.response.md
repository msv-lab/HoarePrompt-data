`s` is a string, `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`. 
`last_occ` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which returns the highest index of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`.**
