The `find` method of the string `s` is called with the character `c` as an argument. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`. The result is assigned to the variable `first_occ`. 

The state of `s` and `c` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the `find` method. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`.**
