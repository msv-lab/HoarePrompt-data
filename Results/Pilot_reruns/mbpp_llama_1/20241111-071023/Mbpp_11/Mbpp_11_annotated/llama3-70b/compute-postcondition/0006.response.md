Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `c` (a character).

The function first finds the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` using the `find` method and stores it in `first_occ`. If `c` is not found in `s`, `first_occ` will be -1.

Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` using the `rfind` method and stores it in `last_occ`. If `c` is not found in `s`, `last_occ` will be -1.

The function then checks if both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1. If they are not -1, it means that `c` is found in `s`. In this case, the function returns a new string that is `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed. This is done by concatenating three parts of the string `s`: the part before the first occurrence of `c`, the part between the first and last occurrences of `c` (excluding the first and last occurrences), and the part after the last occurrence of `c`.

If `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, it means that `c` is not found in `s`. In this case, the function returns the original string `s`.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the code does not actually remove all occurrences of `c` from the string `s`. It only removes the first and last occurrences of `c`, and the part between them. If there are multiple occurrences of `c` in `s`, the ones in between the first and last occurrences will not be removed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns a string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed, and the part between them (excluding the first and last occurrences) if `c` is found in `s`, otherwise returns the original string `s`. Note that this does not remove all occurrences of `c` from the string `s`, but only the first and last ones. **
