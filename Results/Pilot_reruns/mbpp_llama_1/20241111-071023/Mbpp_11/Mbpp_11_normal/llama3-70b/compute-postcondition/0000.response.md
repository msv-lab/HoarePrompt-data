The value of `first_occ` is assigned the result of `s.find(c)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`. If `c` is not found in `s`, `find()` returns -1. The state of `s` and `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found**
