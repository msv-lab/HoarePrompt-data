Let's break it down step by step:

* The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`.
* `s` is a string, and `c` is a character.
* The function returns a value based on the following conditions:
	+ If `c` is found in `s` at both the first and last occurrences, the function returns the modified string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed.
	+ Otherwise, if `c` is not found in `s` or found only at one occurrence, the function returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and return the modified string with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found at both occurrences, otherwise return the original string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, and returns the modified string with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found at both occurrences, otherwise returns the original string.**
