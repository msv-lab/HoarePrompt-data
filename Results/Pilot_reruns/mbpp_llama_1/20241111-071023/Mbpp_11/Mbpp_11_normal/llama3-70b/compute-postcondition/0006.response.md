Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `c` (a character).
2. The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to find the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`, respectively.
3. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1 (i.e., `c` is found at both the first and last occurrences), the function returns the modified string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed.
4. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1 (i.e., `c` is not found in `s` or found only at one occurrence), the function returns the original string `s`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `c` is an empty string, the function will return the original string `s` because `find` and `rfind` will return 0 and 0, respectively, and the condition `first_occ!= -1 and last_occ!= -1` will be false.
* If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string because `find` and `rfind` will return -1 and -1, respectively, and the condition `first_occ!= -1 and last_occ!= -1` will be false.
* If `c` is a substring of `s` that appears multiple times, the function will only remove the first and last occurrences of `c`, not all occurrences.

Based on the code and the annotations, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, and returns the modified string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found at both occurrences, otherwise returns the original string `s`. If `c` is an empty string or `s` is an empty string, the function returns the original string `s`. If `c` is a substring of `s` that appears multiple times, the function only removes the first and last occurrences of `c`. **
