The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`, and returns the original string if `ch` occurs only once or not at all. If `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns a modified string with all characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, including the characters at the indices `first_index` and `last_index`.
