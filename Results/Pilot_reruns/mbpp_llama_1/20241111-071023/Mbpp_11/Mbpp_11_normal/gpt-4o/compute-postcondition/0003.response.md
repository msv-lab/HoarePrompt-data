Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. Otherwise, the function may modify `s` (although the specific modification is not specified in the given code fragment), implying that the function will return a modified string when `ch` occurs more than once in `s`.***
