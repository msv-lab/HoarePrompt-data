The code `first_index = s.find(ch)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` to the variable `first_index`. Since `ch` is present at least once in `s`, `find(ch)` will return a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
