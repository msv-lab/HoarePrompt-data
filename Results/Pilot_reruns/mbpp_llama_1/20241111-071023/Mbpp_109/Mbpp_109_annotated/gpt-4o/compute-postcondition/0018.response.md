The function returns `count`, which is the number of times the rotated `binary_str` has an odd integer value. The state of the variables `binary_str` and `num_rotations` does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `binary_str` is rotated to the right by `num_rotations` positions, `count` is the number of times the rotated `binary_str` has an odd integer value, and the function returns `count`.

Output State: **`binary_str` is rotated to the right by `num_rotations` positions, `count` is the number of times the rotated `binary_str` has an odd integer value, and the function returns `count`.**
