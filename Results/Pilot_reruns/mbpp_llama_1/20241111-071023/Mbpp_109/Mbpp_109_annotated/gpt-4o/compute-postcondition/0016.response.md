To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `_ in range(num_rotations)`, which means the loop will execute as long as the current iteration (`_`) is less than `num_rotations`.

According to the current state, `num_rotations` is greater than 2, which means the loop can execute again if `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration.

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume it is an internal variable that increments automatically at each iteration. Therefore, we can infer that the current iteration is 2 (since `num_rotations` is greater than 2).

To ensure the loop executes again, `num_rotations` should be greater than the next iteration, which is 3.

No other states need to be adjusted, as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`binary_str` is rotated to the right by one position, `num_rotations` is greater than 3, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If the new `integer_value` is odd, `count` is either 2 or 3; otherwise, `count` remains either 0 or 1.**
