The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and `count` is either 0 or 1, so the new value of `count` is either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is rotated to the right by two positions, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`, and `count` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`binary_str` is rotated to the right by two positions, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`, and `count` is either 1 or 2**
