Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description by rotating the binary string the given number of times and counting the number of times the resulting integer value is odd.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`.
2. The program uses a for loop to rotate the binary string `num_rotations` times.
3. In each iteration, the program rotates the binary string by moving the last character to the front using slicing (`binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]`).
4. The program converts the rotated binary string to an integer using the `int` function with base 2 (`int(binary_str, 2)`).
5. The program checks if the integer value is odd by using the modulo operator (`integer_value % 2 == 1`). If it is odd, the count is incremented.
6. The program returns the total count of odd values after all rotations.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the program's correctness for specific inputs.

After analyzing the program and its logic, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
