Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the line where the temporary string `temp` is created. The code uses `s[i:i + len(s)]`, which will result in an incorrect rotation of the string.

For example, if the input string is "101" and the number of rotations is 3, the program will create the string "101101101" and then try to rotate it. However, when creating the temporary string `temp`, it will take the substring from index `i` to `i + len(s)`, which will not correctly rotate the string.

A correct implementation would be to use `s[i:] + s[:i]` to rotate the string, where `i` is the rotation index. This will correctly rotate the string by `i` positions.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:] + s[:i]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```
This implementation correctly rotates the string by `i` positions and counts the number of numbers with an odd value.
