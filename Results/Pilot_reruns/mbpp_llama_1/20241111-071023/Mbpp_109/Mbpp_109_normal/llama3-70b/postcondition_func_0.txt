The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's and an integer `n`, repeats the string `s` `n // len(s) + 1` times, and returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of length `len(s)` of the repeated string, modulo 2. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function returns 0. If `n` is not an integer, the function's behavior is undefined.
