The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `n` is a positive integer. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, modulo 2, if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's and a positive integer `n`, and return the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, modulo 2, or 0 if `n` is 0.
