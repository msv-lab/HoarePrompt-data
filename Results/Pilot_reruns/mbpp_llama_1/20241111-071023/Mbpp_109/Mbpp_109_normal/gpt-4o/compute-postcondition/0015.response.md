Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is rotated one position to the right, `num_rotations` is at least 3, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in a value of either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, retaining its initial value of either 0 or 1, depending on whether the original `integer_value` was even or odd.***
