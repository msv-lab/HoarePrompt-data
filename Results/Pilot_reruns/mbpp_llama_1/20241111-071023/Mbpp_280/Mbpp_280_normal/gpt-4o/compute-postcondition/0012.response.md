The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list, and `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality.

After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following cases:

Case 1: If `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. 

Case 2: If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `arr` and an element, and return whether the element is found in the list along with its index if found, or False along with -1 if not found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element, returns `True` and the index of the element if found in the list, otherwise returns `False` and `-1`.**
