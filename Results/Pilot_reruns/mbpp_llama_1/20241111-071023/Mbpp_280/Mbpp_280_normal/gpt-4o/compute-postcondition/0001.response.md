The function returns `True` and `index`. The value of `index` is 0. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 0.
