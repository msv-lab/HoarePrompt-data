Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, and `index` is 1. If the second element in `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and `1`. If the second element in `arr` is not equal to `element`, the function's behavior is undefined, but `arr`, `element`, and `index` remain unchanged.***
