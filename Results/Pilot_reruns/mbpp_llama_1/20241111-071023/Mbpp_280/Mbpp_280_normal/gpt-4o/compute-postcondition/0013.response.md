Let's analyze the annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `element`. The function iterates through the list `arr` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and value of each element in the list.

If the function finds an element in the list that matches the `element` parameter, it immediately returns `True` and the index of that element.

If the function iterates through the entire list without finding a match, it returns `False` and `-1`.

Now, let's examine the return postconditions:

Case_1: The function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if `element` is found in `arr`. This matches the behavior we observed in the code.

Case_2: The function returns `False` and `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, and `element` remains unchanged. This also matches the behavior we observed in the code.

However, the annotations mention that if `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function's behavior is undefined. But, in reality, if `arr` is an empty list, the function will simply return `False` and `-1`, because the loop will not execute and the function will reach the `return False, -1` statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an element, returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns `False` and `-1`. If `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `False` and `-1`. **
