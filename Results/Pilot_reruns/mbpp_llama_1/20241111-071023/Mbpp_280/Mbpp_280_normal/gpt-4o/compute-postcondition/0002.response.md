Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, `index` is 0, and `value` is the first element in `arr`. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and 0. Otherwise, the function does not return `True` and 0, implying that `value` is not equal to `element`.***
