Based on the initial state and the code snippet, here's the output state:

The function returns `True` and the value of `index`. The value of `index` is 1. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is: `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, `index` is 1, and `value` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns `True` and `1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns `True` and `1`.**
