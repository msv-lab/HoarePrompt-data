After analyzing the code and the problem description, I can see that the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The code uses a simple loop to iterate through the array and checks if the current value is equal to the given element. If it is, the function returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the loop completes without finding the element, the function returns a tuple with False and -1.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. They state that the function returns True and the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array if found, otherwise returns False and -1. They also mention that if the array is empty, the function returns False and -1.

After double-checking, I can confirm that the output hints are accurate and consistent with the code. The code handles all potential cases, including an empty array, and returns the correct output.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior.
