Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It iterates over the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each element, and returns a tuple containing `True` and the index if the element is found, and a tuple containing `False` and `-1` if the element is not found.

After examining the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The function indeed returns `True` and the index `i` if `elem` is found in `arr`, and returns `False` and `-1` if `elem` is not found. The output hints also mention that if `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `False` and `-1`, which is consistent with the code.

I have not found any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code seems to handle all possible cases, including:

* The element is found in the array
* The element is not found in the array
* The array is empty

Therefore, I conclude that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It iterates over the array using `enumerate` and returns a tuple containing `True` and the index if the element is found, and a tuple containing `False` and `-1` if the element is not found. The code handles all possible cases, including the case where the array is empty.
