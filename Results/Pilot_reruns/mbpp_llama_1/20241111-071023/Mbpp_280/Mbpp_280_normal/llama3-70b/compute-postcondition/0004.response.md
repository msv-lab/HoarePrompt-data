The function returns `True` and `i`. The value of `i` is 1. The return statement does not change the state of `arr` or `x`, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 1**
