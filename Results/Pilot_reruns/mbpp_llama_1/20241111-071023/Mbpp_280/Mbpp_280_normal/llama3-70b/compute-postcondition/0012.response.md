The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `elem`. `arr` is a list, and `elem` is any type of object that can be compared to elements of `arr` for equality.

After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases:

Case_1: If `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the found element. If `arr` is empty, this case does not apply.

Case_2: If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return whether the element is found in the list along with its index if found, or return False and -1 if not found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`, returns `True` and the index if `elem` is found in `arr`, otherwise returns `False` and `-1`.**
