The function returns `True` and the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and `i` which is 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 2**
