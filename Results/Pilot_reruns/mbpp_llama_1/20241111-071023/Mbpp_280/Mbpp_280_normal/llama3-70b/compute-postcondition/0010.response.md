To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze its functionality and the provided examples.

The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. It checks if the current element `x` is equal to `elem`. If they are equal, the function returns `True` and the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding a match, it does not return any specific value.

From the provided examples, we can see that:

* The loop executes at least once if `arr` is a list with at least one element.
* If `x` is equal to `elem`, the function returns `True` and the index `i`.
* If `x` is not equal to `elem`, the function does not return any specific value, maintaining the initial state of `arr`, `i`, and `x`.

Considering the loop's functionality, we can identify the following cases:

* If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value.
* If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop executes, and the function returns `True` and the index `i` if `x` is equal to `elem`. Otherwise, the function does not return any specific value.

Output State: **The function returns `True` and the index `i` if `elem` is found in `arr`, otherwise it does not return any specific value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
