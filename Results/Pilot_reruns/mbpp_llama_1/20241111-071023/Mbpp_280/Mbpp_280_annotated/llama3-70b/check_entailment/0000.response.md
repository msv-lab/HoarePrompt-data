Correctness: **True**

I believe the code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem` and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The code annotations provide a clear understanding of the program's behavior. The annotation "If `arr` is not empty and `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value." initially suggests that the function might not handle the case where `arr` is empty or `elem` is not found in `arr`. However, the subsequent annotation "the function returns `False` and `-1`" clarifies that the function does indeed handle these cases by returning `False` and `-1` in such scenarios.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that the function does indeed return `False` and `-1` when `elem` is not found in `arr` or when `arr` is empty, thanks to the `return False, -1` statement at the end of the function. This ensures that the function behaves as expected in all cases.

The problem description provides no examples that would suggest the code is incorrect. Therefore, based on the code and the annotations, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
