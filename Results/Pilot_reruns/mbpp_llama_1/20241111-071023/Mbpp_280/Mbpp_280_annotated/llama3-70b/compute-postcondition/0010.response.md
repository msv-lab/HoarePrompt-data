Based on the loop code and the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, I can determine the loop's output state.

The loop iterates over the list `arr` and checks if each element `x` is equal to `elem`. If a match is found, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element.

If the loop completes without finding a match, the function does not return any value.

Considering the cases where the loop may not execute, we have:

* If `arr` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and the function will not return any value.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **If `arr` is not empty and `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value.**
