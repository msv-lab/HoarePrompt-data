Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `elem` (an object).
2. The function iterates through the list `arr` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element in the list.
3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element `x` is equal to `elem`. If it is, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element.
4. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Now, let's examine the annotations and return postconditions:

* The annotations state that if `arr` is not empty and `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element. This matches the code's behavior.
* The annotations also state that if `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return any value. However, the code actually returns `False` and `-1` in this case.
* The annotations do not mention what happens if `arr` is empty. However, the code's behavior is to return `False` and `-1` in this case, since the loop does not execute.

Considering all potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an object `elem`, and returns `True` along with the index of the matching element if `elem` is found in `arr`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, or if `arr` is empty, the function returns `False` and `-1`. **
