The function returns `True` and `i`. The value of `i` is 2. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 2**
