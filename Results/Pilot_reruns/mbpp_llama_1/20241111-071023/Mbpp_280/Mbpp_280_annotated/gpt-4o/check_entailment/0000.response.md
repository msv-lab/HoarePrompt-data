Correctness: **True**

I have carefully reviewed the code and the annotations, and I believe that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The code iterates over the array using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the given element, the function returns `True` and the index of the element. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

The annotations provide additional context and help to clarify the behavior of the code. For example, the annotation "If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value" is consistent with the code, which would indeed return `False` and `-1` in this case.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* The element is found in the array: the code returns `True` and the correct index.
* The element is not found in the array: the code returns `False` and `-1`.
* The array is empty: the code returns `False` and `-1`.

In all of these cases, the code behaves as expected according to the problem description. I have not found any potential case where the code does not meet the requirements.

The annotations have influenced my reasoning by providing additional context and helping me to understand the code's behavior in certain edge cases. However, I have carefully reviewed the code and verified that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
