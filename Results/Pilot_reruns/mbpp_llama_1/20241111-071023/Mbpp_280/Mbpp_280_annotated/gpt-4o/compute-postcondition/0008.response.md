Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, `value` is the third element of `arr`, `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and `index` (which is 2). Otherwise, the function does not return any value, leaving the state of `arr`, `index`, `value`, and `element` unchanged.***
