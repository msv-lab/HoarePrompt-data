Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element of `arr`, `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and 1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, implying that the condition was not met.***
