Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element of `arr`, `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and 0; otherwise, the function does not return a value, leaving the state of `arr`, `index`, `value`, and `element` unchanged.***
