The function returns `True` and `index`. The value of `index` is 2. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, `value` is the third element of `arr`, `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, and the function returns `True` and `index` which is 2.
