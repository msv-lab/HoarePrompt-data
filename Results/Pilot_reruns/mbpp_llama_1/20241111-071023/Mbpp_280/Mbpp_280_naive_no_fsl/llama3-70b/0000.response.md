Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the given Python program and found that it correctly implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an element `elem` as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `x` is equal to the target element `elem`. If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index `i`.
3. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not in the array.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Empty array: The function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
* Array with a single element: The function correctly returns `(True, 0)` if the element is found, and `(False, -1)` otherwise.
* Array with multiple elements: The function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the element if it is found, and `(False, -1)` otherwise.
* Element not in the array: The function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to behave incorrectly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
