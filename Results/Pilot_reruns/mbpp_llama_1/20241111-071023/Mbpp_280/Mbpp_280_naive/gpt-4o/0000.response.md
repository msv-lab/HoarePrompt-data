Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function iterates over the array using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the target element, the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding the element, it returns a tuple with `False` and -1.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles arrays of different lengths and elements of different types correctly. The unit tests provided also pass successfully, which further confirms the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
