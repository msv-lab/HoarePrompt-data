Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the second list contains zeros. In Python, division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError. Therefore, if list2 contains a zero, the program will crash with an error, instead of handling it according to the problem description.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 0])`, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError, instead of returning a list of results or handling the error in some other way. 

To fix this, the program could add a check for zeros in the second list and handle them accordingly, for example by raising a custom error or returning a special value to indicate an invalid operation.
