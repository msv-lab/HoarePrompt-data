Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the two input lists are of different lengths. If the lists are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter list, and the remaining elements in the longer list will be ignored. This is not the expected behavior according to the problem description, which asks to divide two lists element-wise.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, the function will return `[0.25, 0.4]`, ignoring the third element `3` in the first list. This is not the correct result, as the function should raise an error or handle the case where the lists are of different lengths.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the second list contains zeros. If the second list contains zeros, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is not the expected behavior according to the problem description, which asks to divide two lists element-wise.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6])`, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to divide `2` by `0`. This is not the correct result, as the function should handle the case where the second list contains zeros.
