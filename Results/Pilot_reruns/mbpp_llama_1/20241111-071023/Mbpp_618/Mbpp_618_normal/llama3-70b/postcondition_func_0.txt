The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list with the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`, provided that `list1` and `list2` have the same length and `list2` does not contain any zeros. If the lengths are not equal, it raises a `ValueError`. If `list2` contains a zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.
