Let's break down the information:

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and have the same length. Additionally, `list2` does not contain any zeros.

After executing the function body, the function returns a new list containing the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, with the same length, where `list2` does not contain any zeros, and return a new list with the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2, with the same length, where list2 does not contain any zeros, and returns a new list with the division results of corresponding elements from list1 and list2.**
