Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the second list contains zeros. If the second list contains a zero, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError. This is not in line with the problem description, which does not specify what should happen in this case, but it can be argued that the function should either return a special value (e.g., None or infinity) or raise a custom error.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 0])`, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError, which is not the expected behavior based on the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check for zeros in the second list and handle them accordingly.
