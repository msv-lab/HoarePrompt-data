Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.
2. The function checks if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'.
3. If the lengths are equal, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the result of dividing corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.
4. The function returns this new list.

Now, let's analyze the annotations and the return postconditions:

* The annotations state that `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zero. However, the code does not explicitly check if the lists contain only numbers or if `list2` contains any zeros. Therefore, the functionality should include the possibility of errors if the lists contain non-numeric values or if `list2` contains zeros.
* The return postconditions state that the function returns a list of numbers where each number is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. This is consistent with the code.

Considering the code and the annotations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length, and returns a new list containing the result of dividing corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the lengths of the lists are not equal, it raises a `ValueError`. If the lists contain non-numeric values or if `list2` contains zeros, the function may raise a `TypeError` or a `ZeroDivisionError` respectively. **
