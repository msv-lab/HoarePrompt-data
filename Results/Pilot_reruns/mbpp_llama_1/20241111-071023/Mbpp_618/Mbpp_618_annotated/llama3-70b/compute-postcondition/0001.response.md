Postcondition: ***list1 and list2 are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and list2 does not contain any zero. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, no exception is raised, and the program continues with the lists as is.***
