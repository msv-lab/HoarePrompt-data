Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the length of the longest sublist in a given list of lists. The function iterates through each sublist, checks its length, and updates the `max_length` variable if a longer sublist is found.

I have analyzed the code and found it to be correct for all potential cases. The function handles lists of lists with varying lengths, including empty lists, and correctly returns the length of the longest sublist.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, as they cover various scenarios, including lists with different lengths and elements.

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct and meets the problem description.
