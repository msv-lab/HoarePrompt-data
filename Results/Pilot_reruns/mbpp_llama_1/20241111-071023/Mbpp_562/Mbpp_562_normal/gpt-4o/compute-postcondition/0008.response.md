To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet based on the provided initial state.

The initial state is:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists.
- `max_length` is the maximum of its initial value and the length of the longest sublist among the first two sublists.
- `sublist` is the third sublist in the list.

The given code is:
```python
max_length = len(sublist)
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- The value of `max_length` is updated to be the length of `sublist`.
- The previous value of `max_length` (which was the maximum of its initial value and the length of the longest sublist among the first two sublists) is replaced.
- The length of `sublist` (which is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`) becomes the new value of `max_length`.
- The state of `list_of_lists` and `sublist` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist, and `sublist` is the third sublist in the list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist, and `sublist` is the third sublist in the list.**
