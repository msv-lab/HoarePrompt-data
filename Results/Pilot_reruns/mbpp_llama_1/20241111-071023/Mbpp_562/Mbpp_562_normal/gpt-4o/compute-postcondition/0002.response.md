To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state.

Initial State: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list.

Given Code:
```python
max_length = len(sublist)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. The code assigns the length of `sublist` to `max_length`.
2. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length will be a positive integer (because `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist).
3. The value of `max_length` changes from 0 to the length of `sublist`.
4. The state of `list_of_lists` and `sublist` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is the length of the first sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list**
