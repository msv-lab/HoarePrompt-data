To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `max_length` stores the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists`.
- If `list_of_lists` is not empty, `max_length` will be the length of the longest sublist. Otherwise, it remains 0.
- `sublist` will be the last sublist in `list_of_lists` if the loop executes, and undefined if the loop does not execute.

Given the code:
```
return max_length
```
This code returns the value of `max_length`.

Output State: **`max_length` is returned, which is either 0 (if `list_of_lists` is empty) or the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. The state of `sublist` remains the same as in the initial state, being either the last sublist in `list_of_lists` or undefined.**
