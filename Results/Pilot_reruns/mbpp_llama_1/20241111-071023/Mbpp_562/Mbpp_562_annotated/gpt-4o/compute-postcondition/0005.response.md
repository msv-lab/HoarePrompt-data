`max_length` is assigned the value of the length of `sublist`. The length of `sublist` is the number of elements in the second sublist of `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected, and the state of `sublist` is also not affected because it is not reassigned. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
