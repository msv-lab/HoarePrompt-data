The code `max_length = len(sublist)` assigns the length of `sublist` to `max_length`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length is now assigned to `max_length`. The initial state of `max_length` being either 0 or the length of the first or second sublist is no longer relevant as it is now overwritten with the length of the third sublist.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
