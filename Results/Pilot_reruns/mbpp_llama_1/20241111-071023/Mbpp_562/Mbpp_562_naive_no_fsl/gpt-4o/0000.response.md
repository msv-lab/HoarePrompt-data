Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program is correct. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The function iterates through each sublist, checks if its length is greater than the current maximum length, and updates the maximum length if necessary. The function returns the maximum length found.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It works for lists of lists with varying lengths, including empty lists. It also handles the case where all sublists have the same length. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function's logic is straightforward and correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
