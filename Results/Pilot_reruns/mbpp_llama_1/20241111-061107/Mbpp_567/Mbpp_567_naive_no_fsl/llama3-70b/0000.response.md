Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function uses the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to iterate over the list and compare each element with its next element. If all elements are less than or equal to their next element, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles edge cases correctly:

* If the list is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True`, which is correct because a list with zero or one element is considered sorted.
* If the list contains duplicate elements, the function returns `True` if the duplicates are in order, and `False` otherwise.
* If the list contains elements of different data types, the function may raise a TypeError, but this is not a correctness issue because the problem description does not specify how to handle mixed data types.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
