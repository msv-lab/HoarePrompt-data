To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet.

The code uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. The generator expression `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1)` compares each element in the list with its next element, checking if it is less than or equal to it.

Here's how it works:

1. The `range(len(lst) - 1)` generates indices for all elements in the list except the last one.
2. For each index `i`, the expression `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element.
3. The `all()` function returns `True` if all these comparisons are `True`, meaning all elements are in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the initial state that `lst` is a list of elements that are comparable using the `<=` operator, the output state will be the result of this comparison.

Output State: **The function returns True if the list is in non-decreasing order, False otherwise.**
