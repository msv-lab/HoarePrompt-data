To ensure the loop executes, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop iterates over a range from 0 to `len(lst) - 2` (since the upper bound in `range()` is exclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst) - 1` must be at least 1.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
