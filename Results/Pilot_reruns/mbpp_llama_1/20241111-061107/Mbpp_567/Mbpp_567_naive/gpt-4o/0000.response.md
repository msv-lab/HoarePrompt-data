Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with its next element. If it finds any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it immediately returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly handles:

* Lists that are already sorted in ascending order.
* Lists that are not sorted in ascending order.
* Lists with duplicate elements.
* Lists with negative numbers.
* Lists with a single element (which is considered sorted).

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. The first test case checks a sorted list and the function returns True, the second test case checks a list that is not sorted and the function returns False, and the third test case checks another list that is not sorted and the function returns False.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
