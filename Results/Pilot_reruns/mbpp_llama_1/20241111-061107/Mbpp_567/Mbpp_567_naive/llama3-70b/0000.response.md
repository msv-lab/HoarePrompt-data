Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(lst)` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by using the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression. The generator expression `(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))` generates a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each pair of adjacent elements in the list is in non-decreasing order.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- If the list is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` because there are no pairs of adjacent elements to check.
- If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns `True` because all pairs of adjacent elements satisfy the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]`.
- If the list is not sorted, the function returns `False` because at least one pair of adjacent elements does not satisfy the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
