Output State: **The loop checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `lst` is sorted, the loop completes without returning a value. If `lst` is not sorted, the loop returns False as soon as it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and no value is returned. After the loop executes, `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 2` if `lst` has at least 2 elements and the loop completes without returning a value. If the loop returns False, `i` is the index of the first element in the pair of adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.**
