Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as input. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`.

However, there are some edge cases to consider:

* If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`. This is because there are no pairs of adjacent elements to check.
* If the list is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`. This is because there are no elements to check.

The annotations suggest that the function returns `False` if the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and `True` otherwise. However, the code actually returns `True` for lists with less than 2 elements, including empty lists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of comparable elements, returns `False` if the list has at least 2 elements and is not sorted in non-decreasing order, returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order or has less than 2 elements, including empty lists. **
