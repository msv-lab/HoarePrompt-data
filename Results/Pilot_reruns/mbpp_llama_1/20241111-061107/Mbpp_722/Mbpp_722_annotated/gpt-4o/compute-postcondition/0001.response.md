The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a tuple of two floats, `min_height` is a float, and `min_weight` is a float. The function returns a new dictionary with filtered student data based on the provided `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`.
