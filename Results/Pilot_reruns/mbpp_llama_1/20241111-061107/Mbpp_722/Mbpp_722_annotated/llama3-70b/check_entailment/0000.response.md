Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the code and the problem description, and I believe that the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` filters a dictionary of student data to include only students with height and weight above the minimum values, and returns the filtered dictionary.

The annotations provided with the code were helpful in understanding the expected input and output formats, as well as the potential error cases. For example, the annotation mentions that if `min_height` or `min_weight` is not a float, it raises a TypeError, which is consistent with the problem description.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* An empty input dictionary: The function correctly returns an empty dictionary.
* A dictionary with students having height and weight above the minimum values: The function correctly includes these students in the output dictionary.
* A dictionary with students having height or weight below the minimum values: The function correctly excludes these students from the output dictionary.
* Input values that are not floats: The function correctly raises a TypeError.

I did not find any cases where the code does not follow the problem description. The annotations were helpful in identifying potential edge cases, but upon closer examination, I found that the code handles these cases correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
