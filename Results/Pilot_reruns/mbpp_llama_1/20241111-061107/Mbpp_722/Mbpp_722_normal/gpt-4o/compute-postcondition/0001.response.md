The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a tuple of two floats, `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats.

After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a tuple of two floats, containing only the items from `student_dict` where the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The original state of the variables remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` and two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a dictionary containing only the items from `student_dict` where the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
