Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, and minimum height and weight as input. It then uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the students who have both height and weight above the minimum.

The function correctly checks if the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight, respectively. If both conditions are met, the student is included in the resulting dictionary.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. The tests cover different scenarios, including cases where no students meet the minimum requirements, one student meets the requirements, and multiple students meet the requirements.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the required logic. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
