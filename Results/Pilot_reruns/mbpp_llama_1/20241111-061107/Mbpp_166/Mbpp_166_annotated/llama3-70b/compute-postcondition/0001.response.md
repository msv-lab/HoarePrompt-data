To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means the loop will execute if `nums` is not empty, because `range(len(nums))` would be at least `range(1)`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 0, we need to adjust the state to ensure `nums` has at least one element, because the loop iterates over the indices of `nums`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
