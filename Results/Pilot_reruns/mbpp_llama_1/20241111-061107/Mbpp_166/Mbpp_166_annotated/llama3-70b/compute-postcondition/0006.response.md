The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 1 or 0. 

After incrementing `count` by 1, the value of `count` will be either 2 or 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is either 1 or 2**
