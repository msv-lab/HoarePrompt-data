Based on the initial state, the code snippet only contains a return statement, which does not modify the state of the variables. The return statement simply returns the value of `count`.

Output State: **`nums` remains unchanged, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `nums` that have an even bitwise XOR, and the function returns `count`.**
