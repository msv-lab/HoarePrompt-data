Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` that have an even bitwise XOR, considering only the pairs where the first element is `nums[i]` and the second element is one of the elements in the range `nums[i + 1:]`. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1, otherwise it remains unchanged. `i` is the next index, `nums` has at least `i + 3` elements, and `j` is `i + 3`.***
