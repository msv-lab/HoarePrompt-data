`even_pairs` is assigned the value `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. Since `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, the value of `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`, which is calculated using the formula for combinations. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, and `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, and `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`.**
