The function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`. The value of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` is unknown but they have been calculated based on the list `lst`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`, `odd_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`, and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`, `odd_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`, and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.**
