The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and the other elements is even, but the exact value is unknown. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `j` are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 4 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
