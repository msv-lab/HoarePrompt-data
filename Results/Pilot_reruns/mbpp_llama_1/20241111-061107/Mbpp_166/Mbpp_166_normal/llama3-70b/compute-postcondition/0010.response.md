Postcondition: ***`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is either 3 if it was initially 2, or 2 if it was initially 1. If the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is odd, `count` remains 1 or 2.***
