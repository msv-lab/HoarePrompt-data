To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `j` is currently 3, the next value in the range would be 4. However, we also need to consider the condition `j` in `range(i + 1, len(nums))`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, the range starts from 2, not 1.

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be the next value in the range, which is 4. We also need to ensure that `nums` has at least 4 elements, since `j` is now 4.

The states of `count` and the parity of the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
