The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` depends on the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. If the difference is even, `count` is initially 2, so after incrementing, `count` becomes 3. If the difference is odd, `count` is initially 1, so after incrementing, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `count` is either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `count` is either 2 or 3**
