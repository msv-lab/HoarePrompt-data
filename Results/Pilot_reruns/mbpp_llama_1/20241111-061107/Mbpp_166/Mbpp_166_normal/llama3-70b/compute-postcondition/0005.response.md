To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `len(nums)`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` has at least 2 elements. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `j` needs to be updated to `i + 1`, which is 2.

The state of `count` depends on the sum of the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, but this does not affect the loop condition. Therefore, the state of `count` remains the same.

The updated state is:

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `count` is 1 (or 0, depending on the previous condition)**
