Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in the input list `nums` that xor to an even number. It does this by iterating over all pairs of integers in the list, computing their xor, and checking if the result is even. If it is, the count is incremented.

The function works correctly for all possible inputs because it exhaustively checks all pairs of integers in the list, and the xor operation is correctly used to determine if the pair sums to an even number. The modulo operation (`% 2 == 0`) is used to check if the result of the xor is even, which is a correct and efficient way to do so.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all examples I thought of were correctly handled by the code. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
