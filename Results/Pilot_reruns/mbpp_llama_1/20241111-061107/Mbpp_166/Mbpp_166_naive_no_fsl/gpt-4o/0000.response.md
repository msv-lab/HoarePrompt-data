Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. The XOR operation has the property that `a ^ b` is even if and only if `a` and `b` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). Therefore, the function first counts the number of even and odd integers in the list, and then calculates the number of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers using the formula for combinations (`n * (n - 1) // 2`). The sum of these two counts is the total number of pairs that xor to an even number.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. The function correctly handles lists with both even and odd integers, as well as lists with only one or two elements.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
