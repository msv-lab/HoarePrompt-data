Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the provided Python program and compared it to the problem description. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise.

The code uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate characters from the string. If the length of the resulting set is 1, it means that all characters in the original string were the same, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The annotations provided with the code accurately describe its behavior and match the problem description. The annotations mention that the function returns `True` if the input string is empty or contains only one unique character, which is consistent with the code's behavior.

I have not found any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles empty strings, strings with a single character, and strings with multiple characters. The use of the `set` data structure ensures that the program works efficiently and correctly even for large input strings.

Therefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
