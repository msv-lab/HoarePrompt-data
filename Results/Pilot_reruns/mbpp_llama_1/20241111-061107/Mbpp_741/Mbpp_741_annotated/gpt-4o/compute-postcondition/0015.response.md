The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string. After executing the function body, the function returns values based on the following cases:

Case 1: If `s` is empty, the function returns `True`.

Case 2: If `s` is not empty, the function checks if all characters in the string `s` are equal to the first character `first_char`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`. If all characters match, the function returns `True`.

Case 3: The function returns `True` in this case, but since Case 1 and Case 2 already cover all possible scenarios (empty string and non-empty string), this case is redundant and does not provide any additional information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if `s` is empty or if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s`, returns `True` if `s` is empty or if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character, and `False` otherwise.**
