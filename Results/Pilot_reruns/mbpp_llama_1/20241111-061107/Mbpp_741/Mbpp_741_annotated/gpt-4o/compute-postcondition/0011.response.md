Postcondition: ***`s` is not empty with at least one character removed from the beginning, `first_char` is the first character of the original `s`, `char` is the first character of the current `s` (which is the third character of the original `s`). If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function continues execution without returning `False`.***
