The function returns `False`. The values of `s` and `first_char` are not affected, so the output state is `s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`**
