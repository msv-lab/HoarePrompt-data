To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop would run. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be empty, because an empty string would not allow the loop to start. Additionally, since `first_char` is defined as the first character of `s` when `s` is not empty, we need to ensure that `s` has at least one character for `first_char` to be meaningful.

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `s` must not be empty to allow the loop to execute.
- Since `s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
