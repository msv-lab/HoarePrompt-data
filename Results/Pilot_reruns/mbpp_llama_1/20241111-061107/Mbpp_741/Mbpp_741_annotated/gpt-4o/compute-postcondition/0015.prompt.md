You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: s is a string.
```
def func_1(s):
```
Output: Case_1: Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function does not return a value explicitly, implying that it may return a default value or continue executing the next part of the code. This covers all edge cases, including when `s` is a non-empty string.

Case_2: The loop checks if all characters in the string `s` are equal to the first character `first_char`. If `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, the loop iterates over each character in `s`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, the function's return value is not specified in the given code snippet, but based on the loop's functionality, it can be inferred that the function would return `True` if all characters match. Therefore, the output state is that the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char` or if `s` is empty, and `False` otherwise.

Case_3: The function returns True

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
