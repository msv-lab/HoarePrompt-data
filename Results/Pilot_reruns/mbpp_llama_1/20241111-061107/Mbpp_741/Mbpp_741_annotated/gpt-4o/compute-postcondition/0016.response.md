Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input.
2. If the string `s` is empty, the function immediately returns `True`.
3. If the string `s` is not empty, the function iterates over each character in `s` and checks if all characters are equal to the first character `first_char`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, the function returns `True`.

Now, let's analyze the annotations:

* The annotations suggest that the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character `first_char` or if `s` is empty, and `False` otherwise. This is consistent with the code.
* However, the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens if the string `s` has only one character. In this case, the loop will not iterate, and the function will return `True` because the single character is equal to itself.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is empty, has only one character, or if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character, and `False` otherwise. **
