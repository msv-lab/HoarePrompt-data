To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for char in s:`, which means the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `s` is not empty.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is equal to `first_char`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what conditions must be met:
- Since `char` is equal to `first_char` and `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` must have been the first character in the previous iteration.
- For the loop to continue, there must be more characters in `s` after `char`.
- The value of `char` in the next iteration should be the next character in `s`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should still be not empty but with at least one character removed from the beginning (since we've already processed the first character).
- `first_char` remains the same as it's defined by the string `s`, not by the iteration process.
- `char` should be the next character in `s` after the one that was processed in the previous iteration.

Given these adjustments, the new state should reflect that `s` has at least one less character (but is still not empty), and `char` is now the second character of the original `s` (or the first character of the adjusted `s`).

State: **`s` is not empty with at least one character removed from the beginning, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of the original `s`**
