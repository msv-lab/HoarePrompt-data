Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, implying that the condition `char` equals `first_char` is met.***
