To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for char in s:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is the third character of `s`.
- The condition `char` equals `first_char` is met.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the next character in `s`. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `char` without knowing the contents of `s`. But we can say that `char` is the next character in `s`.
- `s` will still be a non-empty string, but it will not have changed since the loop iterates over the existing string, not modifying it.
- `first_char` will still be the first character of `s`, as the loop does not modify the string.

However, considering the given information that `char` is the third character of `s` and the loop iterates over each character, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 4 characters (since we've already processed the first 3 characters). 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 4 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the fourth character of `s`.**
