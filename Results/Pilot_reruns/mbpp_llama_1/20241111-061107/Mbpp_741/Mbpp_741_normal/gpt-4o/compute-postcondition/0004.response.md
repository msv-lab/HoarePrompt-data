The function returns `False`. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.**
