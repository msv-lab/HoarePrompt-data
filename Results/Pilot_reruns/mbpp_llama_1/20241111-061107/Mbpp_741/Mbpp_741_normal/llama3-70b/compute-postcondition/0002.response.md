Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, here's a step-by-step analysis of the function's functionality:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is expected to be a non-empty string.
2. The function uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the string `s` and then checks if the length of the resulting set is equal to 1.
3. If the length of the set is 1, it means that all characters in the original string `s` are the same, and the function returns `True`.
4. If the length of the set is not 1, it means that there are different characters in the original string `s`, and the function returns `False`.

However, there's a potential edge case that's not explicitly mentioned in the annotations: what if the input string `s` is empty? In this case, the `set` data structure would be empty, and the `len` function would return 0. The function would then return `True`, which might not be the intended behavior.

Another potential edge case is that the function does not handle non-string inputs. If the input is not a string, the `set` data structure might not work as expected, and the function might raise an error or produce unexpected results.

Considering these potential edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same and `False` otherwise. However, if the input string is empty, the function returns `True`, and if the input is not a string, the function's behavior is undefined. **
