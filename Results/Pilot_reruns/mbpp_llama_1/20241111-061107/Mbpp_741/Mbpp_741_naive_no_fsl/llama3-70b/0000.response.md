Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. Here's why:

1. The function uses the `set` data structure, which automatically removes duplicate elements. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one unique character.
2. The function then checks the length of the set using `len(set(s))`. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string are the same.
3. The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether all characters are the same or not.

I couldn't find any potential case where this function would not work as expected. It correctly handles:

* Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns `True` (since there are no characters to compare)
* Single-character strings: `func_1("a")` returns `True`
* Strings with multiple identical characters: `func_1("aaa")` returns `True`
* Strings with multiple distinct characters: `func_1("ab")` returns `False`

Overall, the function is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
