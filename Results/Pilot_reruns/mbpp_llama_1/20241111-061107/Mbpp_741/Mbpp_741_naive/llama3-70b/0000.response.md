Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s: str) -> bool` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. The function uses the `set` data structure, which automatically removes duplicate elements. By comparing the length of the set to 1, the function effectively checks if all characters in the string are identical.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles:

* Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns `True`, which is correct since there are no characters to compare.
* Single-character strings: `func_1("a")` returns `True`, which is correct since there is only one character.
* Multi-character strings with the same character: `func_1("aaa")` returns `True`, which is correct since all characters are the same.
* Multi-character strings with different characters: `func_1("ab")` returns `False`, which is correct since not all characters are the same.

The function's logic is concise and accurate, making it correct for all potential cases.
