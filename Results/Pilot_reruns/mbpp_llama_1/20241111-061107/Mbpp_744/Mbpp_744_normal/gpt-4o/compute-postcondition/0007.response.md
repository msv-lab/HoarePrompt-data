The function returns `True`, and the state of the variables does not change. The value of `tup` is still a tuple with at least 3 items, and the value of `item` is still the third item in the tuple. Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the tuple, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the tuple, and the function returns `True`**
