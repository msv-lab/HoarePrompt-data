Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. This appears to match the problem description, which asks to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` if the tuple contains any `None` values, and `False` otherwise. This matches the behavior of the `any` function, which returns `True` as soon as it finds a `True` value in the iterable.

After double-checking, I couldn't find any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code should work correctly for tuples of any length, including empty tuples, and for tuples containing any type of elements, including `None`.

Therefore, I conclude that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the `any` function with a generator expression to efficiently check if any element in the tuple is `None`. This approach is correct and should work for all possible inputs, including edge cases.
