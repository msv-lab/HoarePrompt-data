Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values. It uses the built-in `any` function with a generator expression to iterate over the tuple. The expression `x is None` checks if each element `x` in the tuple is `None`. If any element is `None`, the `any` function returns `True`, indicating that the tuple contains at least one `None` value. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases:

* If the tuple is empty, `any` will return `False`, which is correct since an empty tuple does not contain any `None` values.
* If the tuple contains only non-`None` values, `any` will return `False`, which is correct.
* If the tuple contains at least one `None` value, `any` will return `True`, which is correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
