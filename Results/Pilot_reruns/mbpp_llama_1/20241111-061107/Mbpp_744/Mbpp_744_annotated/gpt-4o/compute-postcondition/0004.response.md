The function returns `True`. The values of `tup` and `item` are not affected by the return statement, so the output state is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns `True`**
