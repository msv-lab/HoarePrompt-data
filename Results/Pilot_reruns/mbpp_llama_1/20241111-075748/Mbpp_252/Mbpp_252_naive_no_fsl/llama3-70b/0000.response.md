Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number, and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase (or argument) of the complex number. These two values are returned as a tuple, which represents the polar coordinates of the complex number.

The function handles all potential cases, including:

* Complex numbers with non-zero real and imaginary parts
* Complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part
* Complex numbers with negative real or imaginary part
* Complex numbers with very large or very small magnitude

The `cmath.phase` function also correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero, returning a phase of 0.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
