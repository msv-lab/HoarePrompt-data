Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function takes a single argument `num` which is expected to be a complex number, but it is passed as a single value to the `complex` function. This will only work correctly if the input is a real number, not a complex number.

For example, if the input is a complex number like `3+4j`, the function will not work correctly because `complex(3+4j)` will raise a TypeError.

To correctly convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, the function should accept two arguments, the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, and then use these to create a complex number which is then passed to `cmath.polar`. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    return cmath.polar(complex(real, imag))
```

This function will correctly convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.
