The function func_1 accepts a complex number num and returns a tuple containing its magnitude and phase angle.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the function does exactly what the annotations describe. The cmath.polar function is used to convert the complex number into its polar form, which is a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle any potential errors that may occur when converting the input to a complex number. For example, if the input is not a valid complex number, the function may raise a ValueError or TypeError.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing its magnitude and phase angle. If the input is not a valid complex number, the function may raise a ValueError or TypeError. **
