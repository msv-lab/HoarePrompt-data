The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of `num`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a complex number `num` and return its magnitude and phase angle as a tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing its magnitude and phase angle.**
