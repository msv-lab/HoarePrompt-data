To calculate the result, we need to understand what `cmath.polar(complex(num))` does. The `cmath.polar()` function converts a complex number into its polar form, which is a tuple of the magnitude (or length) and the phase angle of the complex number.

Given that `num` is a complex number, let's denote it as `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `j` is the imaginary unit.

`cmath.polar(complex(num))` will return a tuple `(r, phi)`, where `r` is the magnitude of the complex number, calculated as `sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`, and `phi` is the phase angle, calculated as `atan2(b, a)`.

Since the initial state only mentions that `num` is a complex number without specifying its exact value, we cannot calculate the exact magnitude and phase angle.

Therefore, the output state is: `num` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of `num`.**
