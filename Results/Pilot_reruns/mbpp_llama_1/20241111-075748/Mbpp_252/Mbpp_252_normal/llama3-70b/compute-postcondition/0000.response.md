The function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. The absolute value of a complex number is its magnitude, and the phase is the angle it makes with the positive real axis. The return statement does not change the state of `c`. Therefore, the output state is `c` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`.

Output State: **`c` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`.**
