The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`. `c` is a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a complex number `c` and return a tuple containing its absolute value and phase.

Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number c and returns a tuple containing its absolute value and phase.**
