Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` removes all lowercase characters from the string, not just lowercase substrings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The function should only remove sequences of lowercase characters, not individual lowercase characters.

For example, if the input string is 'aBCd', the function should return 'BCd', not 'BC'. The function does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this, the function should be modified to keep track of sequences of lowercase characters and only remove those sequences, not individual lowercase characters.
