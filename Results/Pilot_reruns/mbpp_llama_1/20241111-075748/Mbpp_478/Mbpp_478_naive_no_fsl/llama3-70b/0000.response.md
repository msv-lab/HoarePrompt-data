Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` removes all lowercase characters from the string, not just lowercase substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", whereas the correct output should be "HWorld" because "ello" is the only lowercase substring that should be removed.

The correct implementation should iterate through the string and remove any sequence of lowercase characters. The current implementation only checks each character individually and removes it if it's lowercase, without considering the context of the surrounding characters.
