The function returns a string that consists of all uppercase characters from the string `s`. The `isupper()` function checks if a character is uppercase, and the `join()` function combines the characters into a string. The state of `s` is not changed, so the output state is `s` is a string, and the function returns a string consisting of all uppercase characters from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and the function returns a string consisting of all uppercase characters from `s`.**
