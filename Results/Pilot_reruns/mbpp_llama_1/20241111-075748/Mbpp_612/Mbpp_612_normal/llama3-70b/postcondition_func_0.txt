The function accepts a list of lists and returns a list of two lists containing the first and second elements of all sublists respectively, without modifying the original list. However, if a sublist has less than two elements, the function raises an IndexError. If the input is not a list of lists, the function raises a TypeError. If the input list is empty, the function returns a list of two empty lists.
