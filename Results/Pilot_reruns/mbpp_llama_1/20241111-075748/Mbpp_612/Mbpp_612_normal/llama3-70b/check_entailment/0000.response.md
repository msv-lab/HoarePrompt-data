After reviewing the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist.

The code uses a generator expression to create the two lists, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. The code does not modify the original list, which is also in line with the problem description.

However, I can think of a few edge cases that the code might not be handling:

* What if the input list is empty?
* What if a sublist has less than two elements?
* What if the input is not a list of lists?

Now, let's review the output hints to see if they agree with the code. According to the output hints, the function raises an IndexError if a sublist has less than two elements, and raises a TypeError if the input is not a list of lists. This is consistent with the code, as the generator expression will raise an IndexError if it tries to access the second element of a sublist that only has one element, and will raise a TypeError if it tries to iterate over a non-list object.

The output hints also state that if the input list is empty, the function returns a list of two empty lists. This is also consistent with the code, as the generator expression will simply return two empty lists in this case.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct. It handles all the edge cases mentioned in the output hints, and the output hints agree with the code.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is correct because it handles all the edge cases mentioned in the output hints, and the output hints agree with the code. The code uses a generator expression to create the two lists, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. The code does not modify the original list, which is also in line with the problem description.
