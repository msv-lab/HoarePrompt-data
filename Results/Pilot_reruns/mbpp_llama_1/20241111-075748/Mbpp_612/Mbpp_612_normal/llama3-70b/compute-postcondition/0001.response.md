The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist is a list of exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of two lists. The first list contains the first elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists containing the first and second elements of all sublists respectively, without modifying the original list.**
