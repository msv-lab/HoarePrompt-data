The function returns a list containing two lists: `first_elements` and `second_elements`. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; and the function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; and the function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`.**
