Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the provided Python program, and it appears to correctly implement the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist has two elements. It then returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first element of each sublist, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist.

The program uses generator expressions to extract the first and second elements of each sublist, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. The resulting lists are then returned as a list of two lists.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* An empty list of lists as input: The function correctly returns a list of two empty lists.
* A list of lists with a single sublist: The function correctly returns a list of two lists, each containing a single element.
* A list of lists with multiple sublists: The function correctly returns a list of two lists, each containing the corresponding elements from the sublists.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
