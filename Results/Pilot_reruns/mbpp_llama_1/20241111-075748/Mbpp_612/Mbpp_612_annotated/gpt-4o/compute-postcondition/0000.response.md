To calculate the result, we'll break down the code step by step.

The code is creating a new list called `first_elements` using a list comprehension. This list comprehension iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and selects the first element of each sublist (`sublist[0]`).

Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, `sublist[0]` will always select the first element of each sublist.

The impact of the code on the program is that it creates a new list `first_elements` containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The original list `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

The output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
