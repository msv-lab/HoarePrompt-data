Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the greater value between them. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `a`. This matches the problem description.

However, I do notice that the problem description does not explicitly state what should happen if `a` or `b` are not numbers. The code does not have any error handling for this case, so it's possible that it could raise a TypeError if `a` or `b` are not numbers.

Looking at the output hints, they seem to agree with the code. They state that the function returns the greater value between `a` and `b`, and that if `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `a`. They also mention that if `a` or `b` are not numbers, the function raises a TypeError. This matches the behavior of the code.

The output hints do not provide any additional information that would suggest the code is incorrect. The unit tests provided also seem to cover the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, based on the code, problem description, and output hints, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description, returning the greater value between `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `a`. The code does not have any error handling for non-numeric inputs, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem description. The output hints and unit tests provided confirm the expected behavior of the function.
