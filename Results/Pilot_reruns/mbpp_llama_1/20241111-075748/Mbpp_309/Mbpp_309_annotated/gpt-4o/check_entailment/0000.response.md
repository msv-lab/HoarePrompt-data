Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two comparable numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns the maximum value between them. If the numbers are equal, it returns `a`.

The code annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function and highlight the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal, in which case the function returns `a`. The annotations also mention that the function may raise a TypeError if `a` and `b` are not numbers, which is consistent with the code's behavior.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* When `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns `a`.
* When `b` is greater than `a`, the function returns `b`.
* When `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `a`.
* When `a` and `b` are not numbers, the function raises a TypeError.

In all these cases, the code behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

The annotations were helpful in understanding the code's behavior, particularly in highlighting the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal. However, I have double-checked that the annotations accurately reflect the code's behavior and have not relied solely on the annotations to make my judgment.
