Let's break down the information:

* The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`.
* Both `a` and `b` are numbers, which can be either integers or floats.
* The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two comparable numbers `a` and `b`, and return the maximum value between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts two comparable numbers `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them.**
