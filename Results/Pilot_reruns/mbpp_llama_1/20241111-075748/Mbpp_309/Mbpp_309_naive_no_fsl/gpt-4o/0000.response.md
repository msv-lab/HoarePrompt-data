Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers. The function uses a conditional expression to return the larger of the two input numbers `a` and `b`. The `assert` statements demonstrate the function's correctness for various test cases.

Upon analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. The function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly, as shown in the provided test cases. Additionally, the function would also work correctly for cases where the two input numbers are equal, as it would return either of the two numbers (although the problem description doesn't explicitly mention this case).

Overall, the code is simple, yet correct, and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
