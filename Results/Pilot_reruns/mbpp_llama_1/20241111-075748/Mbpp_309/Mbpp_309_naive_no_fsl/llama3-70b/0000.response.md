Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. The built-in `max()` function in Python returns the largest of the input values, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Positive and negative integers
* Floating-point numbers
* Zero
* Equal input values

In all these cases, the `max()` function behaves as expected, returning the maximum of the two input values. Since I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
