The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elem`. `tup` is a tuple, and `elem` is an element that can be compared with the elements in the tuple for equality. After executing the function body, the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and return the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple tup and an element elem, and returns the count of elem in tup.**
