Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the count of `elem` in `tup` using the built-in `count` method. This matches the problem description.

After reviewing the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The hints mention that the function handles cases where `elem` is not present in `tup` or `tup` is an empty tuple, which is consistent with the behavior of the `count` method.

Upon further examination, I couldn't find any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The `count` method is a standard method in Python that works correctly for tuples, and it returns 0 if the element is not found.

Therefore, I conclude that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the built-in `count` method, which is a standard and reliable way to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where the element is not present or the tuple is empty, and I couldn't find any other edge cases that the code might not be handling.
