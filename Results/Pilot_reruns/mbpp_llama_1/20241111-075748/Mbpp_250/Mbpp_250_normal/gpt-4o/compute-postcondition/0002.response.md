Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. The annotation states that `tup` is a tuple and `element` is an object that can be compared to elements in the tuple for equality.

The function returns the count of `element` in `tup` using the `count` method.

Looking at the code, it seems that the annotation accurately describes the functionality of the code. The `count` method will return the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`, regardless of the type of `element`.

However, it's worth noting that the `count` method will return 0 if `element` is not found in `tup`. This is an edge case that is not explicitly mentioned in the annotation, but it is a valid behavior of the code.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of the element in the tuple. If the element is not found in the tuple, the function returns 0. **
