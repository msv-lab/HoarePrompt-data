Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element as input and returns the count of the element in the tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The function is correct because it handles all potential cases:

* If the element is present in the tuple, it returns the correct count.
* If the element is not present in the tuple, it returns 0.
* The function works for tuples of any size and with any type of elements.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. The tests cover different scenarios, including counting an element that is present multiple times, counting an element that is present only once, and counting an element that is not present at all.

Overall, the function is simple and effective, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
