Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The `count()` method in Python is a built-in method that returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. This method works correctly for all potential cases, including when the element is not present in the tuple (in which case it returns 0), when the element appears multiple times, and when the tuple is empty.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function is simple and straightforward, and the `count()` method is a reliable and well-tested part of the Python standard library. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
