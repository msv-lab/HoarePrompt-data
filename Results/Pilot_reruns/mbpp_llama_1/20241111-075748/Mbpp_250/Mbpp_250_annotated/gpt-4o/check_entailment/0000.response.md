Correctness: **True**

I have carefully reviewed the code and the annotations, and I believe that the code meets the requirements of the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly this using the built-in `count` method of tuples.

The annotations provide additional information about the function's behavior, including the fact that it will raise an `AttributeError` if the input is not a tuple, and a `TypeError` if the element is not comparable with the elements of the tuple. However, these annotations do not describe any cases that the code does not handle correctly.

In fact, the code is quite simple and straightforward, and it is clear that it will work correctly for all valid inputs. The `count` method is a standard part of the Python tuple API, and it is designed to do exactly what the problem description requires.

I did not find any cases where the code does not work as expected, and I believe that it meets all the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Note that I did consider the possibility that the code might not work correctly if the input tuple is very large, or if the element is a complex object that is expensive to compare. However, these are not cases that are specifically excluded by the problem description, and I believe that the code would still work correctly in these cases (although it might be slow or use a lot of memory).
