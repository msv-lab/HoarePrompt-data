Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The `count` method is a built-in tuple method in Python that returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple.

I have analyzed the function and could not find any potential case where it does not work as expected. The function correctly handles the following scenarios:

* When the element is present in the tuple, it returns the correct count.
* When the element is not present in the tuple, it returns 0.
* When the tuple is empty, it returns 0.
* When the element is a duplicate in the tuple, it returns the correct count.

The function is concise and readable, and it uses the built-in `count` method, which makes it efficient and easy to understand. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
