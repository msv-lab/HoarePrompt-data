The function returns `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The value of `math.pi` is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. The return statement does not change the state of `radius` and `height`, so the output state is `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, and the function returns `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`.

Output State: **`radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, and the function returns `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`.**
