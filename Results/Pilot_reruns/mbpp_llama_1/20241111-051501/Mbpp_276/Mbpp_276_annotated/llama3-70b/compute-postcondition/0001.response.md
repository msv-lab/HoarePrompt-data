The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the result of the mathematical expression `math.pi * radius * height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` and return the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height.


Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative real number parameters radius and height, and returns the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height.**
