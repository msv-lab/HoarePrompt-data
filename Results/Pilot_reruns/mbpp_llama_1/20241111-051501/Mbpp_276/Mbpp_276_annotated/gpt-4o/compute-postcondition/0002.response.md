The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of a cylinder, which is calculated as π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, radius and height, which are non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cylinder, calculated as π * radius² * height.**
