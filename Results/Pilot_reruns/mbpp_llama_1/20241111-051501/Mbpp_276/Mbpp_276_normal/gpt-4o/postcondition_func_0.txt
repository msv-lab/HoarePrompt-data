The function accepts two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder as Ï€ times the square of `radius` times `height`, and returns the calculated volume. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as negative or non-numeric inputs, and may return incorrect or NaN values in these cases.
