Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` accurately calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The function takes in the radius and height as parameters and returns the calculated volume. 

The code correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a cylinder, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. It handles all potential cases, including positive and negative values for radius and height, as well as zero values for either parameter (although in a real-world scenario, a cylinder with zero radius or height would not be physically meaningful).

The function assumes that the input values are numeric, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. If non-numeric values were passed to the function, it would raise a TypeError, but this is not a correctness issue with the function itself.

Overall, the function is correct and accurately implements the desired functionality.
