To determine the functionality of the function `func_1(n)`, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. If `n` is 5 or more, the function returns 0. This is based on the condition `if (n >= 5) :` followed by `return 0`.
3. If `n` is less than 5, the function enters the `else` block. However, within this block, it only initializes a variable `factorial` to 1 but does not calculate the factorial of `n` or return the last digit of the factorial as suggested by the annotations.

Given the code provided, the critical observation is that the calculation of the factorial and returning its last digit (modulo 10) is not implemented for `n < 5`. The code simply initializes `factorial` to 1 and does not proceed with any further calculations or returns.

Therefore, considering all potential cases and the actual code implementation, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 5 or more, it returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, it initializes a variable `factorial` to 1 but does not perform any further calculations or returns, effectively not fulfilling the intended purpose of returning the last digit of the factorial of `n` as suggested by the annotations. **
