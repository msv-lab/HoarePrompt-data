The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. According to the annotations, if n is less than 2, it returns n. If n is 2 or 3, it returns n. If n is 4, it returns 4. For all other values of n greater than 4, it returns 0.

However, upon analyzing the code, we can see that the annotations are accurate. The code checks for the conditions mentioned in the annotations and returns the corresponding values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the value of n if it is less than 4, 4 if n is 4, and 0 for all other values of n greater than 4.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns n if n is less than 2, n if n is 2 or 3, 4 if n is 4, and 0 for all other values of n greater than 4. **
