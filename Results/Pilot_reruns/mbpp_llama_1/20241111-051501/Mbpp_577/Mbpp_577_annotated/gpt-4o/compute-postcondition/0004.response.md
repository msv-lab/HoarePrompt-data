To determine the functionality of the function `func_1(n)`, let's analyze the code and annotations step by step:

1. The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
3. If `n` is less than 5, the function initializes a variable `factorial` to 1.
4. However, the code is missing the actual calculation of the factorial of `n` and the return of the last digit of the factorial (i.e., the factorial modulo 10).

The annotations suggest that the function should calculate the factorial of `n` and return the last digit of the factorial, but the code does not implement this calculation. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is incomplete.

Based on the code, the function only returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, but it does not perform any calculation or return any value if `n` is less than 5.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, but it does not perform any calculation or return any value if `n` is less than 5, due to missing implementation. **
