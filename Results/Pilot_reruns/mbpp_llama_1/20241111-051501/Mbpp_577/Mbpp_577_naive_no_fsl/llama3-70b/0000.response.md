Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the last digit of the factorial of a given number, but the provided program does not perform any factorial calculations. It simply returns the input number for inputs less than or equal to 4, and returns 0 for all other inputs.

A counterexample is the input `n = 5`. The last digit of the factorial of 5 is 0 (since 5! = 120), but the program returns 0 for all inputs greater than 4, without actually calculating the factorial. This shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the factorial of the input number and then returning the last digit of the result.
