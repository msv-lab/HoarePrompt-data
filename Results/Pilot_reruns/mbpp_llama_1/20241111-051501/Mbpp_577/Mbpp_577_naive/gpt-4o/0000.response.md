Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. 

The function works by first checking if the input number `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, the function returns 0 because the last digit of the factorial of any number greater than or equal to 5 is always 0 (due to the presence of 2 and 5 in the factorial, which contribute a factor of 10).

If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the result by taking the modulus of the factorial with 10.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the function.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
