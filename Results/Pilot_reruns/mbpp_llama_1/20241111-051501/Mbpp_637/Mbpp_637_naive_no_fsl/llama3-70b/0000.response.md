Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it means there is no profit and no loss. The function correctly implements this logic by returning `True` if the two prices are equal and `False` otherwise. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including when the cost price and selling price are equal, when the selling price is greater than the cost price (indicating a profit), and when the selling price is less than the cost price (indicating a loss). Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
