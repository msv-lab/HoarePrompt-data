Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, which means there is no profit and no loss. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two prices are equal.

The annotations provided also support this conclusion. They state that the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, which matches the problem description. The annotations also mention that the function raises a TypeError if either parameter is non-numeric, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. However, this behavior is reasonable and does not contradict the problem description.

I did not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles all possible inputs, including equal and unequal prices, and returns the expected boolean value. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Note that the problem description does not mention what should happen if the inputs are not numbers, but the code raises a TypeError in this case, which is a reasonable behavior. However, this is not a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, since the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case.
