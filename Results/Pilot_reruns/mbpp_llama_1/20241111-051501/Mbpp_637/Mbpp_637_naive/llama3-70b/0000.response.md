Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it means there is no profit or loss, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` (implicitly, since the function only returns a boolean value).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles all possible scenarios:

* If the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns `True`, indicating no profit or loss.
* If the cost price is less than the selling price, the function returns `False`, indicating a profit.
* If the cost price is greater than the selling price, the function returns `False`, indicating a loss.

The function is simple and straightforward, and its logic is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all possible inputs.
