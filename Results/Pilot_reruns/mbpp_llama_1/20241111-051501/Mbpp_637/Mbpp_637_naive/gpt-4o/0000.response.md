Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. It returns `True` if the two prices are equal, indicating no profit or loss, and `False` otherwise. The provided unit tests also validate this behavior. 

The function correctly handles all possible cases:

- If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it returns `True`, indicating no profit or loss.
- If the cost price is less than the selling price, it returns `False`, indicating a profit.
- If the cost price is greater than the selling price, it returns `False`, indicating a loss.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
