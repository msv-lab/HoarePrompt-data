Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are initially `True`. If `i` is a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `True`), the multiples of `i` in the `is_prime` list are marked as non-prime (`False`), starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i` is not a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `False`), the `is_prime` list remains unchanged.***
