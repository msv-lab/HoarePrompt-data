The code sets the first two elements of the `is_prime` list to `False`. The value of `n` is not changed. The initial state of `is_prime` is a list of `n` `True` values, but the first two elements are now set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`**
