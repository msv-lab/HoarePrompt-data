To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop run. The loop iterates over a range that starts at `i * i`, ends at `n`, and increments by `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 2
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`

Let's analyze the loop condition:
- The loop starts at `i * i`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`. This means the loop will start from the 4th index (considering the list is 0-indexed).
- The loop ends at `n`, which means it will iterate up to the `n-1` index.
- The increment is `i`, which is 2.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i * i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, this condition is already met.

However, we need to consider the state of `j`, which is the loop variable. At the start of the loop, `j` should be equal to `i * i`, which is 4.

Additionally, since the loop iterates over the `is_prime` list, we need to ensure that the list has at least `n` elements.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 4**
