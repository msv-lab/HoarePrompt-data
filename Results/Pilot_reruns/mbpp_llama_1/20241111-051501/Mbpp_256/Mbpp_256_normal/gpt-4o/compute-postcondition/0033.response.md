Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is `True`, the elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n` are also set to `False`, with the rest being `True`. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False` and elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` being `False`. If `n` is 9 or less, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False`.***
