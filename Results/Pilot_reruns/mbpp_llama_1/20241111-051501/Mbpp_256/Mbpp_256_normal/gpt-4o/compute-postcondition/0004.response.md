To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (rounded up to the nearest integer). For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, because the loop starts from 2.
2. The square root of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, so that the loop has at least one iteration.

Considering the initial state, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state as follows:

* `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, because the square root of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
* `i` is initialized to 2, which is the starting value of the loop.
* The list `is_prime` is not directly related to the loop condition, but its length is still `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`**
