To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop statement:

`for j in range(i * i, n, i):`

This loop will execute if the following conditions are met:

1. `i * i` is less than `n`, because the `range` function generates numbers from `i * i` to `n-1` with a step of `i`.
2. `i` is a valid value for the `range` function, which means it should be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:

`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are initially `True`

We can adjust the state as follows:

* `n` is greater than or equal to 4 ensures that `n` is at least 4, but we need to ensure that `i * i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is 3, `i * i` is 9. Therefore, `n` should be greater than 9.
* `i` is 3, which is a valid value for the `range` function.
* `j` is not initialized before the loop, so we can initialize it to the first value in the `range`, which is `i * i` = 9.

The state of `is_prime` is not relevant to the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are initially `True`**
