To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. However, this part of the state does not directly influence the variable `is_prime` but indicates a condition under which the function might return. The critical part for our analysis is that `n` is a non-negative integer.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
is_prime = [True] * n
```
This line creates a list called `is_prime` and initializes it with `n` number of `True` values.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the list `is_prime` will have a length equal to `n`. If `n` is 0, the list will be empty. If `n` is 1 or more, the list will contain `n` number of `True` values.

Therefore, the output state, considering the provided code and initial state, is that `n` remains a non-negative integer (since its value isn't changed by the code), and `is_prime` is a list of `n` `True` values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` `True` values**
