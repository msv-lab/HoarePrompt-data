Let's analyze the given for loop statement: `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. 

The loop will execute again if `j` is still within the range defined by `i * i` and `n`, with a step size of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `n` is greater than 12, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, the 12th element set to `False`, and the 15th element set to `False`, while the remaining elements (except the 10th, 12th, and 15th) are `True`.

To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to check if there are any values of `j` that satisfy the condition `i * i <= j < n` and `j` is a multiple of `i`. 

Since `i` is 3, `i * i` is 9. The next multiple of `i` (3) after 15 is 18. However, `n` is greater than 12, but we don't know if it's greater than 18. 

So, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 18. 

Also, since `j` is now 18, we need to adjust the state of the `is_prime` list accordingly. The 18th element of the `is_prime` list should be set to `False`.

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `i` is 3, `j` is 18, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, the 12th element set to `False`, the 15th element set to `False`, the 18th element set to `False`, and the remaining elements (except the 10th, 12th, 15th, and 18th) are `True`.**
