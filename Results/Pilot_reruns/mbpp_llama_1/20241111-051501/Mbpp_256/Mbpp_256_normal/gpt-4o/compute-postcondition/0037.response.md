The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. 

After executing the function body, 
- If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0.
- If `n` is greater than 2, the function returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and return either 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or the count of prime numbers up to `n` if `n` is greater than 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns 0 if n is less than or equal to 2, otherwise returns the count of prime numbers up to n.**
