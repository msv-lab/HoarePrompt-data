The code `is_prime[j] = False` changes the value of the element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list to `False`. The value of `j` is 8, so the ninth element in the `is_prime` list is changed to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, the eighth element is `True`, the ninth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 8**
