Let's analyze the code step by step:

* The code `is_prime[j] = False` affects the `is_prime` list by setting the element at index `j` to `False`.
* The initial state of `j` is 9.
* The initial state of `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are initially `True`.

Since `j` is 9, the code sets the 10th element of the `is_prime` list to `False`. The remaining elements of the list, including the first 9 elements, are not affected.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and the `is_prime` list has its 10th element set to `False`, while the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements (except the 10th) are `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and the `is_prime` list has its 10th element set to `False`, while the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements (except the 10th) are `True`.**
