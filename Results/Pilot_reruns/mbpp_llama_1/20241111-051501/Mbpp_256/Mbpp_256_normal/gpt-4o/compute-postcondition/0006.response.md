To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 4.

2. The code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns `False` to the `j`-th index of the `is_prime` list.

3. Since `j` is 4, this operation changes the 5th element of the `is_prime` list to `False`. The list initially had its first two elements as `False` and the rest as `True`. After this operation, the first five elements will be `False`, `False`, `True`, `True`, `False`, and the rest will remain `True`.

4. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 4**
