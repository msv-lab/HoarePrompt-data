Based on the code and the description, my initial assessment is that the program seems to be correct. It defines a function `func_1` that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`, and it uses another function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the `is_prime` function may return incorrect results for composite numbers with prime factors greater than the square root of `num`. This is because the loop in `is_prime` only checks divisibility up to the square root of `num`, and it may miss prime factors greater than that.

The output hints seem to agree with the code, but they also highlight this potential issue with `is_prime`. The hint for `is_prime` says that it may return incorrect results for composite numbers with prime factors greater than the square root of `num`, which matches my initial concern.

Therefore, I conclude that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it may return incorrect results for numbers with prime factors greater than the square root of `num`.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n` when `n` has prime factors greater than its square root. For example, if `n` is 25, the program will incorrectly count 25 as a prime number because its prime factor 5 is greater than its square root.
