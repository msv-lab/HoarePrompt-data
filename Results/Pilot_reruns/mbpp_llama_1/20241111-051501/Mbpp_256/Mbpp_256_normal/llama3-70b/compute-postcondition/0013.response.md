Based on the initial state, the function has already checked if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any number `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the function has reached this point, it means that `num` is not less than 2 and is not divisible by any `i` in the range.

The code `return True` explicitly returns a value of `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number or has a prime factor greater than the square root of `num`.

The output state is: `num` remains unchanged, `i` is the square root of `num` rounded down to the nearest integer, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`num` remains unchanged, `i` is the square root of `num` rounded down to the nearest integer, and the function returns `True`.**
