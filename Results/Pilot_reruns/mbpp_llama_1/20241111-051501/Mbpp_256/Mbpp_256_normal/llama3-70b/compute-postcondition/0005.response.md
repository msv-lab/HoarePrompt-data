To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the square root of `num` plus 1.

Since `i` is 2, we need to adjust `i` to be 3 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, we need to ensure that the square root of `num` is at least 3, so `num` must be greater than or equal to 9.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
