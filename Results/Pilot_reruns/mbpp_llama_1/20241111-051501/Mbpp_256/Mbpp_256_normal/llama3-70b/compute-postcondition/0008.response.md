To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is greater than or equal to 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `i` is 3, we need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4.

If `num` is greater than or equal to 16, then `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 4, which means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to be greater than or equal to 16.

Additionally, since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 4.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
