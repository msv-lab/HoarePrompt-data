The function returns `False`. The values of `num` and `i` do not change because the return statement does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, and the function returns `False`**
