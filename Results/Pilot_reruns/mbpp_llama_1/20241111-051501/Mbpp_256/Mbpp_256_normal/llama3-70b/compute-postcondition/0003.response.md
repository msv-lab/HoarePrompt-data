The function returns `False`, and the state of the variables `num` and `i` do not change. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the function returns `False`**
