You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `count` is 0. If `n` is greater than 2, `count` is the number of prime numbers in the range [2, `n-1`].
    return count
    #State of the program after the return statement: If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `n` is less than or equal to 2, `count` is 0, and the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than 2, `count` is the number of prime numbers in the range [2, `n-1`], and the function returns the number of prime numbers in the range [2, `n-1`].
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the number of prime numbers in the range [2, n-1] if n is greater than 2, 0 if n is less than 2, but incorrectly returns 0 if n is exactly 2.

#Function 2:
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #State of the program after the return statement: `num` is a non-negative integer, and the function returns `False`
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, and the function returns `False`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a non-negative integer, if num is less than 2, the function returns False, otherwise the function does not return False, implying it may return a different value or continue executing
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or 3, the function does not execute the loop and returns a value other than `False` or continues executing. If `num` is 4 or greater, the function returns `False` if `num` is divisible by any number up to its square root; otherwise, it does not return `False` and may return a different value or continue executing. In all cases, `i` takes on the last value it was assigned in the loop, which is the square root of `num` if `num` is not a perfect square, or the largest factor of `num` less than or equal to its square root if `num` is a perfect square.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: `num` is either less than 2, 2, 3, or greater than or equal to 4; `i` is either not assigned or is the square root of `num` if `num` is not a perfect square, or the largest factor of `num` less than or equal to its square root if `num` is a perfect square; and the function returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, returns `True` if `num` is 2 or 3, and returns `True` if `num` is greater than 3 and not divisible by any number up to its square root; otherwise, it returns `False`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
