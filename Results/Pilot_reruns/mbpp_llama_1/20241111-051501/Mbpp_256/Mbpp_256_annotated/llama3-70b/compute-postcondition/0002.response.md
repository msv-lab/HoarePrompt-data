To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to start. The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `num` must be such that its square root is greater than or equal to 2, because the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, and the loop starts from 2.

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer and if `num` is less than 2, the function returns False, we can infer that for the loop to be considered for execution, `num` must be at least 2 or more. However, for the loop to actually execute (i.e., have at least one iteration), `num` must be such that its square root is greater than 2, because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `num`. This means `num` must be greater than 4 (since 2^2 = 4) for the loop to have at least one iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `num` is greater than 4, and since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value it would take in the loop, which is 2.

State: **num is greater than 4, i is 2**
