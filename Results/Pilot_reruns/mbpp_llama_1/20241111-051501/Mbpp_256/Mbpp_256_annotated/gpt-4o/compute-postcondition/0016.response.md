The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 9. The value of `n` is greater than 9, so `is_prime` has at least 10 elements. The value of `i` is 3, but it is not affected by the code. The value of `j` is 9, but it is not changed by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
