After analyzing the annotated code and the return postconditions, I can provide a concise summary of the function's functionality.

The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 

If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. 

For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list of boolean values representing whether each number up to `n` is prime or not. It then returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`. 

However, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function does not execute the loop that generates the list of prime numbers, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements being `True`. In this case, the function still returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`, which would be 0 for `n` equals 0 or 1, and 1 for `n` equals 1 if we consider 1 as not prime.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and returns the count of prime numbers up to `n` otherwise. For `n` equals 0 or 1, it returns 0, and for `n` equals 1, it returns 0 since 1 is not considered a prime number in this case. **
