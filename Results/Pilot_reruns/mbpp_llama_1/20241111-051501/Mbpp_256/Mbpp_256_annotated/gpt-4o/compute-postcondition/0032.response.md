Output State: **The loop iterates over the multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` (exclusive) and sets the corresponding indices in the `is_prime` list to `False`. After the loop executes, `is_prime` will have `False` values at indices that are multiples of `i` in the range `[i * i, n)`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop will not execute, and `is_prime` will remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains constant throughout the loop, and `j` takes on the last multiple of `i` that is less than `n` in the last iteration of the loop.**
