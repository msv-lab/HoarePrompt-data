To solve this task, we need to understand the initial state and the impact of the given code on the program.

Initial State: The loop generates a list of boolean values representing whether each number up to `n` is prime or not. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements being `True`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop executes, and the `is_prime` list is updated such that all indices that are multiples of prime numbers in the range `[2, sqrt(n)]` are set to `False`, and the remaining indices are set to `True`.

Given Code:
```python
return sum(is_prime)
```
Impact of the Code: The function returns the sum of the boolean values in the `is_prime` list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0 when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, the sum of the `is_prime` list represents the count of prime numbers up to `n`.

Output State: The function returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`, and the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`.**
