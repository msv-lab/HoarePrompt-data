Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values. If `i` is a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `True`), the `is_prime` list will have `False` values at indices that are multiples of `i` and `True` values otherwise. If `i` is not a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `False`), the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements being `True`. After the loop executes, `i` is still 3, and `j` is the last multiple of `i` that is less than `n`.***
