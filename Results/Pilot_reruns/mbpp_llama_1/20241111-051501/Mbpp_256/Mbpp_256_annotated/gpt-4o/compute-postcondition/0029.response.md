To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```
for j in range(i * i, n, i):
```

This loop depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the range generated by `i * i`, `n`, and the step `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, and an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i * i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 4, `i * i` equals 16. Given that `n` is greater than 16, the condition is met.

However, the loop also depends on the range generated by `range(i * i, n, i)`. The next value of `j` would be `i * i + i`, which is 20. 

The state of `is_prime` is not directly relevant to the loop condition, but it's part of the overall state.

Considering the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`, and `j` is 20**
