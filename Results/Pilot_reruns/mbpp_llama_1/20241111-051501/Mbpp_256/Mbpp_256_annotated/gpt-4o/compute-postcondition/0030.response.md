To solve this task, I will analyze the code and the initial state step by step.


The given Python code is:
```
is_prime[j] = False
```
The initial state is: `n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`, and `j` is 20.


Now, let's think step by step:


The value of `j` is 20, so the code sets the value of `is_prime[20]` to `False`. This does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `is_prime[16]`, or the unknown index of `is_prime`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[20]` is `False`.


Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[20]` is `False`.**
