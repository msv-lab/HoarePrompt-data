The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, and `j` is 15, so `is_prime[15]` is set to `False`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 15, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `is_prime[12]` is `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 15.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 15, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `is_prime[12]` is `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 15**
