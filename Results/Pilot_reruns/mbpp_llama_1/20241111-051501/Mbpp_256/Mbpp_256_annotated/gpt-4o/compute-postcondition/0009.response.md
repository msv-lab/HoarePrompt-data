To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

Current state:
- `n` is at least 6
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 6

Since the loop has already executed with `j` being 6, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be the next value in the range `i * i, n, i`. Given that `i` is 2, the next value of `j` would be `i * i + i`, which is `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`. However, since `j` has already reached 6, the next value should be `6 + i`, which is `6 + 2 = 8`.

However, the loop's range is defined by `n`, and `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue. Since `n` is at least 6, for `j` to be 8, `n` must be at least 8 to ensure `j` (which is 8) is within the range.

The state of `is_prime` and `i` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, as the loop's continuation depends on the range defined by `n` and the current value of `j`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is at least 8, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
