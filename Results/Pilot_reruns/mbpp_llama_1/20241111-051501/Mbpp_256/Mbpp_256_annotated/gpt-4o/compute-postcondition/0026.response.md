The code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns `False` to the `j`-th index of the `is_prime` list. Since `j` is equal to `i * i` and `i` is 4, `j` is equal to 16. 

The value of `n` is greater than 3, and `i * i` is less than `n`, so `n` is at least 17 (since `i` is 4). Therefore, the `is_prime` list has at least 17 elements, and the 16th index is a valid index.

The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. The state of `is_prime` changes, and the 16th index is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[16]` is `False`, `i` is 4**
