To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop run. The loop iterates over a range that starts at 2 and goes up to the square root of `n` (rounded up to the nearest integer). 

Given the initial state: `n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 3, because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is 3 or less, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty (for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, the loop does not execute because the range is empty or starts from a value that is out of the defined range for `n = 3`).

Also, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be the starting point of the loop, which is 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2**
