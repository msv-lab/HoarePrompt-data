To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `i` is currently 3, the next value in the range would be 4. However, we also need to ensure that the loop condition is still satisfied, i.e., `i` should be less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Since `n` is greater than 3, the square root of `n` is greater than or equal to the square root of 3, which is approximately 1.73. Therefore, the square root of `n` is greater than 3, and `i` can be incremented to 4.

The state of `is_prime` and `j` is not relevant to the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 4, `j` is the last multiple of 3 that is less than `n`**
