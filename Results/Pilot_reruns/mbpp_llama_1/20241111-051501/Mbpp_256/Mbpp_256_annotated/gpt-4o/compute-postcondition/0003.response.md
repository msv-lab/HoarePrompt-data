The code sets the first two elements of the `is_prime` list to `False`. The initial state of `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to `True`. 

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the list `is_prime` has at least one element (when `n` is 0) or more. The first two elements of `is_prime` are set to `False`, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`.**
