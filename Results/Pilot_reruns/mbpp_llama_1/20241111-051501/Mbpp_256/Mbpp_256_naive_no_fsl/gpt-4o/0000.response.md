Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative number `n` as input and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers less than `n`. The algorithm works by creating a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n`, where `is_prime[i]` represents whether `i` is a prime number or not. The algorithm then iterates over the array, marking the multiples of each prime number as non-prime.

The program correctly handles the edge cases:

* If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
* If `n` is greater than 2, the function initializes the `is_prime` array and marks the multiples of each prime number as non-prime.
* The function returns the sum of the `is_prime` array, which represents the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

The provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program.

After analyzing the code and testing it with various inputs, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
