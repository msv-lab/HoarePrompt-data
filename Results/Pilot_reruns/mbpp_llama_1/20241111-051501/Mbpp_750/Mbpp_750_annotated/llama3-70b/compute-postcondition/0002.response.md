The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as parameters. According to the annotated code and return postconditions, the function concatenates `lst` and `tup` and returns the resulting list.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as:

* What if `lst` or `tup` is not a list or tuple, respectively? The function may throw an error or produce unexpected results.
* What if `lst` or `tup` is empty? The function will still return a list, but it may not be the expected result.

Considering these potential edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, concatenates them, and returns the resulting list. However, it does not handle cases where `lst` or `tup` is not a list or tuple, respectively, and may produce unexpected results or errors in such cases. If `lst` or `tup` is empty, the function will still return a list. **
