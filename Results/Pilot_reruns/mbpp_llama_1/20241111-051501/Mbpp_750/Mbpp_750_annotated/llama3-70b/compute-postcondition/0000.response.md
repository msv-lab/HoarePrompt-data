To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program and the previous values of the affected variables.

The code `return lst + list(tup)` performs the following operations:

1. Converts the tuple `tup` to a list using the `list()` function.
2. Concatenates the list `lst` with the converted list using the `+` operator.
3. Returns the resulting list.

Since the initial state specifies that `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple, the output state will be the concatenated list.

However, without knowing the specific values of `lst` and `tup`, we cannot provide a more precise output state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst` and `tup` are concatenated, and the function returns the resulting list**
