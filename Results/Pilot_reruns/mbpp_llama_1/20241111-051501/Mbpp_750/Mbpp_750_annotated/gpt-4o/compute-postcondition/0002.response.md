Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. According to the annotations, `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple.

The function returns the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` as a new list. This is achieved by converting the tuple `tpl` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it with `lst` using the `+` operator.

Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the annotations accurately describe the functionality of the code. The code does indeed concatenate the list `lst` and the tuple `tpl` and returns the result as a new list.

However, I also consider potential edge cases. For example, what if `lst` or `tpl` is an empty list or tuple? The code will still work correctly and return an empty list or a list containing only the elements of the non-empty list or tuple.

Another potential edge case is what if `lst` or `tpl` contains non-hashable elements, such as lists or dictionaries? The code will still work correctly, as the `+` operator can concatenate lists containing non-hashable elements.

Therefore, based on the code and annotations, I conclude that the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`, handling empty lists and tuples, and lists containing non-hashable elements correctly. **
