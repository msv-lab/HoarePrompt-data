Based on the code and problem description, my initial assessment is that the code might not be handling the case where `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple. The problem description states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list, but it does not specify what should happen if the inputs are not of the correct type.

Upon examining the output hints, I see that they agree with the code in that the function raises a `TypeError` if `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple. However, this behavior is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

Considering both the code and the output hints, I believe that the code does not exactly follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description does not specify what should happen if the inputs are not of the correct type, but the code raises a `TypeError` in such cases.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple according to the problem description. The problem description does not specify what should happen in such cases, but the code raises a `TypeError`. A correct implementation would need to either handle these cases explicitly or clarify the expected behavior in the problem description.
