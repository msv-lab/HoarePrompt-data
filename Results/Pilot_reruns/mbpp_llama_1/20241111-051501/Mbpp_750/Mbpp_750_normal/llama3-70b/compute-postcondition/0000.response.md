To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code. The code `return lst + list(tup)` performs the following operations:

1. Converts the tuple `tup` into a list using the `list()` function.
2. Concatenates the list `lst` with the converted list from `tup` using the `+` operator.
3. Returns the resulting list.

Given the initial state that `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple, the output state will be the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tup` is a tuple, and the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`.**
