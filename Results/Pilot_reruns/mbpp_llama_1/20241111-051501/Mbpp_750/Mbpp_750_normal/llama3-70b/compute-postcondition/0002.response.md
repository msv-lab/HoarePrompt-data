Let's analyze the code and annotations step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tup`. According to the annotations, `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple.

The function returns the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`. The annotations suggest that this is the expected behavior.

However, let's examine the code more closely. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate `lst` and the list version of `tup`. This operation will work correctly as long as `lst` is indeed a list and `tup` is indeed a tuple.

But what if `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple? The annotations do not mention what happens in these cases. Looking at the code, we can see that if `lst` is not a list, the `+` operator will raise a `TypeError`. Similarly, if `tup` is not a tuple, the `list()` function will raise a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not just a simple concatenation of `lst` and `tup`. It also includes the implicit assumption that `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. If these assumptions are not met, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`, but raises a `TypeError` if `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple. **
