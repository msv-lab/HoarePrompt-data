Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase equivalent using the built-in `upper()` method. The problem description requires a function to convert a given string to uppercase.

Upon reviewing the code, I found that it correctly implements the required functionality. The `upper()` method is a standard Python method that converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases, including strings with only lowercase letters ('person', 'final') and a string with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters ('Valid'). The function correctly returns the expected uppercase output for all test cases.

I couldn't find any potential edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
