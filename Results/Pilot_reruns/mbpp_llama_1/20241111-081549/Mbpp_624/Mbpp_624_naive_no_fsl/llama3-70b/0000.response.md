Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. The function uses the built-in `upper()` method in Python, which converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles:

* Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns an empty string, which is the expected result.
* Strings with only uppercase characters: `func_1("HELLO")` returns "HELLO", which is the expected result.
* Strings with only lowercase characters: `func_1("hello")` returns "HELLO", which is the expected result.
* Strings with mixed case characters: `func_1("HeLlO")` returns "HELLO", which is the expected result.
* Non-English characters: `func_1("héllo")` returns "HÉLLO", which is the expected result.

The function is also correctly typed, with a clear indication that it takes a string as input and returns a string as output.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and I couldn't find any edge cases where it fails to work correctly.
