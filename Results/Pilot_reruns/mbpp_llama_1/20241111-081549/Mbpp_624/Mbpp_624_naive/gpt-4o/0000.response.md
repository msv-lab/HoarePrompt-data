Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly converts a given string to uppercase. The function uses the built-in `upper()` method in Python, which converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase and leaves all other characters unchanged.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Strings containing only lowercase letters (e.g., 'person', 'final')
* Strings containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., 'Valid')
* Strings containing non-alphabetic characters (e.g., 'Hello, World!')

The `upper()` method is a standard and well-tested function in Python, and it is unlikely to produce incorrect results. The function `func_1(s)` simply wraps this method and returns the result, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for specific inputs. However, even without these tests, the function's simplicity and use of a well-established method make it a reliable and correct solution.
