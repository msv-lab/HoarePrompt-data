Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`, `count` is 2. If `elem` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, maintaining the existing state of `tup`, `elem`, and `count`.***
