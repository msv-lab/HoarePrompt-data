Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`.
2. `tup` is a tuple that contains at least one tuple element.
3. The function processes the elements of `tup` and keeps track of the last element processed by the loop (`elem`).
4. The function returns the count of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element.

Based on this information, we can describe the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing at least one tuple element. It returns the count of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element in the tuple.**
