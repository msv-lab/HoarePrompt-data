According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`. For the loop to execute again, `tup` must have at least three elements, and `elem` must be the third element of `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple that contains at least three tuple elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`.**
