The function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`. Since `elem` is the first element of `tup`, its index is 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple that contains at least one tuple element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple that contains at least one tuple element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0**
