To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tup` is a tuple that contains at least one tuple element.
- `elem` is the first element of `tup`.

The loop statement is `for elem in tup:`. This indicates that the loop will iterate over each element in the tuple `tup`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next element in `tup`. Since `elem` is currently the first element, for the loop to continue, `elem` should be adjusted to be the next element in `tup`, and `tup` should still contain at least one more element beyond the current `elem`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `tup` has at least two elements (since we've moved past the first one and there needs to be a next one), and `elem` should be the second element of `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple that contains at least two tuple elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`.**
