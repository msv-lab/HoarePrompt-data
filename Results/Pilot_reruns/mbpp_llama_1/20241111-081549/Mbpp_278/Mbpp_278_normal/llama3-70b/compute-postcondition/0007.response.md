Since `elem` is the third element of `tup`, we know that `tup.index(elem)` will return the index of the third element in the tuple. In Python, tuple indices start at 0, so the index of the third element is 2.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple that contains at least three tuple elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and the function returns 2**
