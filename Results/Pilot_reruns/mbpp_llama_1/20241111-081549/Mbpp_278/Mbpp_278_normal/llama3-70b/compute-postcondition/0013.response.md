Let's analyze the annotated code and return postconditions.

The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. The function iterates over each element in the tuple. If it finds an element that is a tuple itself, it returns the index of that element. If no tuple element is found, the function returns the length of the tuple.

However, there is a potential edge case that is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. If the input tuple `tup` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the length of the tuple, which is 0.

Another potential edge case is that the function does not handle the case where the input is not a tuple. If the input is not a tuple, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to iterate over it.

Based on the code and the potential edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` as input, returns the index of the first tuple element if found, returns the length of the tuple if no tuple element is found, and returns 0 if the input tuple is empty. If the input is not a tuple, the function raises a TypeError. **
