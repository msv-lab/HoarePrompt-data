Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple that contains at least two tuple elements, `count` is 1, `elem` is the second element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `elem` is not a tuple, the program continues executing without any changes to `tup`, `count`, or `elem`.***
