The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the third element in the tuple, its index is 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns 2.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns 2**
