The function returns `tup.index(elem)`, and `elem` is the first element in the tuple `tup`. The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element, which is 0 for the first element. Therefore, the function returns 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple, and the function returns 0**
