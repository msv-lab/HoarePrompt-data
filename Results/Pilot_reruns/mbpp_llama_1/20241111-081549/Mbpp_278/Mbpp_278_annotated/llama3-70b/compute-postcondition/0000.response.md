According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tup` is a tuple that may contain a tuple as one of its elements, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `tup` has at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the tuple.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple**
