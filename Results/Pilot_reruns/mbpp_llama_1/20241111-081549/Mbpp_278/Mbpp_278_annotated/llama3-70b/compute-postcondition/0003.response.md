To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for elem in tup:`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the tuple `tup`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the tuple. 

For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in `tup` after the current `elem`. 

So, the state of `tup` needs to be adjusted to have at least 2 elements, and `elem` should be the second element in the tuple.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the tuple.**
