Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple. If `elem` is also a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`, which is 0. If `elem` is not a tuple, the function does not return any value, implying that the execution of the program fragment is incomplete or that there are additional statements after the if statement that are not shown.***
