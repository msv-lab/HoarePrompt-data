Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns the difference between them. The function uses the symmetric difference operator (`^`) to find the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates, and the `sorted` function is used to return the result in a sorted order.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* When `list1` and `list2` have no common elements, the function returns all elements from both lists.
* When `list1` and `list2` have some common elements, the function returns only the elements that are unique to each list.
* When `list1` or `list2` is an empty list, the function returns the elements of the non-empty list.
* When both `list1` and `list2` are empty lists, the function returns an empty list.

The function handles all edge cases and works as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
