Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when there are duplicate elements in the input lists. The symmetric difference of two sets will only contain unique elements, but the problem description does not specify that the output should not contain duplicates. 

However, the main issue with the program is that it does not correctly sort the result list. The `sort` method is used with a `key` function that returns the index of each element in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. This means that if an element appears in both `list1` and `list2`, its index in the combined list will be the index of its first occurrence in `list1`, not its index in `list2`. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])`, the program will return `[1, 4]`, which is correct. However, if we call `func_1([2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 4])`, the program will also return `[3, 4]`, which is incorrect because the `3` should come before the `4` in the output.

A correct implementation would use a different approach to sort the result list, such as sorting by the minimum index of each element in `list1` and `list2`.
