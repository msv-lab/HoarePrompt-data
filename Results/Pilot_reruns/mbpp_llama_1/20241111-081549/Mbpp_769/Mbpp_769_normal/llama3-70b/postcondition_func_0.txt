The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. If the lists are identical, the function returns an empty list. If one list is empty, the function returns a sorted list of unique elements from the non-empty list. The function also removes duplicates from the resulting list.
