To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code sorts the `result_list` based on the index of its elements in the combined list `list1 + list2`. The `key` function in the `sort` method uses a lambda function that returns the index of each element in the combined list.

Given the initial state, `result_list` contains elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The `sort` method sorts these elements based on their first occurrence in the combined list `list1 + list2`.

Since the `sort` method sorts the list in-place, it modifies the `result_list` directly. The other variables, `list1`, `list2`, `set1`, `set2`, and `diff_elements`, are not affected by the `sort` method.

Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and `result_list` is a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, sorted based on their first occurrence in the combined list `list1 + list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and `result_list` is a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, sorted based on their first occurrence in the combined list `list1 + list2`.**
