Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists.

The function first converts `list1` and `list2` into sets, `set1` and `set2`, respectively. This is done to remove duplicates from the lists.

Then, it calculates the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`, which gives a set of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. This is stored in `diff_elements`.

Next, it converts `diff_elements` into a list, `result_list`.

The function then sorts `result_list` based on the first occurrence of each element in the combined list `list1 + list2`. This is done using the `sort` method with a lambda function as the key.

Finally, the function returns `result_list`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic.

* If `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will still work correctly.
* If `list1` and `list2` have no elements in common, the function will return a sorted list of all elements from both lists.
* If `list1` and `list2` have some elements in common, the function will return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list.

However, there is a potential edge case that is not handled by the annotations. If `list1` and `list2` contain duplicate elements, the function will treat them as distinct elements when calculating the symmetric difference. This means that if `list1` contains an element multiple times, and `list2` contains the same element only once, the function will include the element in the result list multiple times.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list, including duplicates if present in the original lists. The list is sorted based on the first occurrence of each element in the combined list `list1 + list2`. **
