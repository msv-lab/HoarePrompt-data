`result_list` is assigned the value of `diff_elements` converted to a list. The value of `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and `result_list` is a list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and `result_list` is a list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both.**
