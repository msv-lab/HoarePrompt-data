The function returns `result_list`, and `result_list` is a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, sorted based on their first occurrence in the combined list `list1 + list2`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, `result_list` is a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and the function returns `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements from `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, `result_list` is a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both, and the function returns `result_list`.**
