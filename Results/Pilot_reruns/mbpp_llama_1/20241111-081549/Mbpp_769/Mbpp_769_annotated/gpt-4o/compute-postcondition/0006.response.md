The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. After executing the function body, the function returns a sorted list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted by their index in `list1 + list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists, list1 and list2, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list1 or list2, ordered by their appearance in the combined list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters list1 and list2, returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list1 or list2, ordered by their appearance in the combined list.**
