The code sorts the `result_list` based on the index of its elements in the combined list `list1 + list2`. The `key` function in the `sort` method returns the index of each element in the combined list.

The impact of the code on the program is that the `result_list` is sorted in ascending order based on the index of its elements in the combined list.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `list1` is a list
- `list2` is a list
- `set1` is a set created from `list1`
- `set2` is a set created from `list2`
- `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both
- `result_list` is a list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both

After execution, the `result_list` is sorted, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, `result_list` is a sorted list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted by their index in `list1 + list2`.**
