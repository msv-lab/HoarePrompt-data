The code creates a new list called `result_list` and assigns it the value of `diff_elements` converted to a list. The `diff_elements` set contains elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

Since `set1` and `set2` are created from `list1` and `list2` respectively, and `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, the elements in `diff_elements` are already unique and are either in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

The conversion of `diff_elements` to a list does not change the elements themselves, but it changes the data structure from a set to a list.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, and `result_list` is a list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, and `result_list` is a list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.**
