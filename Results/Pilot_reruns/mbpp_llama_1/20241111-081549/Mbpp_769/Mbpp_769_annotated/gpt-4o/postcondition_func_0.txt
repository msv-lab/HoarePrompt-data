The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in list1 or list2 but not in both, ordered by their index in the combined list of list1 and list2, with potential inconsistencies in sorting for elements that appear in both lists at different indices, and ignoring duplicate elements within each list.
