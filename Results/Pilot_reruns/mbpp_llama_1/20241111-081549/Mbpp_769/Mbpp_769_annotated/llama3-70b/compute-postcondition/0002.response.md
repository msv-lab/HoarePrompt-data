Let's break down the code and annotations step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. The annotation states that the function returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists `list1` or `list2`.

The code uses the `^` operator to find the symmetric difference between the two sets, which means it returns a set of elements that are in exactly one of the sets. The `sorted` function is then used to sort the resulting list.

However, there are a few potential edge cases to consider:

* If both `list1` and `list2` are empty, the function will return an empty list.
* If one of the lists is empty, the function will return a sorted list of elements from the non-empty list.
* If the lists contain duplicate elements, the function will treat them as distinct elements.
* If the lists contain non-hashable elements (e.g., lists or dictionaries), the function will raise a `TypeError`.

The annotations do not explicitly mention these edge cases, but the code's behavior can be inferred from the use of the `^` operator and the `sorted` function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists. If both lists are empty, it returns an empty list. If one list is empty, it returns a sorted list of elements from the non-empty list. It treats duplicate elements as distinct and raises a `TypeError` if the lists contain non-hashable elements. **
