The function returns the sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists `list1` or `list2`. The `^` operator is used to find the symmetric difference of the two sets, which means it returns a set of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The `sorted` function is then used to sort this list in ascending order.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact elements in `list1` and `list2`, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **The function returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists `list1` or `list2`.**
