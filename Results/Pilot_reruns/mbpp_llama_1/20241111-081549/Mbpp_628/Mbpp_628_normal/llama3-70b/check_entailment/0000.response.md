Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The code is also robust and handles edge cases such as an empty string or a string without spaces, as it will simply return the original string.

Now, let's look at the output hints. The output hints agree with the code and the problem description. They mention that the function will throw an error if the input is not a string, which is a valid behavior. They also mention that the function will return the original string if it is empty or does not contain spaces, which is also correct.

After analyzing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is correct because it exactly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20', which is the expected behavior. The code is also robust and handles cases such as an empty string or a string without spaces. The output hints agree with the code and the problem description, and I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected.
