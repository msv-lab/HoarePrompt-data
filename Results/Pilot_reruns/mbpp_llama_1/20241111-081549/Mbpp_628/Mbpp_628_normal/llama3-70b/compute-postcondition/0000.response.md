The function returns the result of `s.replace(' ', '%20')`. Since `s` is a string, the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a space (' ') with '%20'. The state of `s` remains unchanged because strings are immutable in Python. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, and the function returns the string `s` with all spaces replaced with '%20'.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and the function returns the string `s` with all spaces replaced with '%20'.**
