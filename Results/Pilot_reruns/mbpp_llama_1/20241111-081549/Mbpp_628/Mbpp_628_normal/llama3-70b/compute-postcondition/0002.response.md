The function func_1 accepts a string parameter s. According to the code, it replaces all spaces in the string s with '%20' and returns the resulting string. 

The annotations and the return postconditions suggest that this is the intended behavior of the function, and the code indeed implements this behavior.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as:

* If the input string s is None or not a string, the function will throw an error.
* If the input string s is empty, the function will return an empty string.
* If the input string s does not contain any spaces, the function will return the original string.

Despite these potential edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string s, replaces all spaces with '%20', and returns the resulting string. If the input is not a string, it will throw an error. If the input string is empty or does not contain spaces, it will return the original string. **
