Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. The return postconditions state that the function returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'.

Upon analyzing the code, I can see that the function does exactly what the annotations say. The `replace` method is a standard string method in Python that replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring. In this case, it replaces all spaces with '%20'.

There are no potential edge cases or missing logic in this function. The function will work correctly for all strings, including empty strings, strings with no spaces, and strings with multiple spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20', handling all possible cases including empty strings, strings with no spaces, and strings with multiple spaces. **
