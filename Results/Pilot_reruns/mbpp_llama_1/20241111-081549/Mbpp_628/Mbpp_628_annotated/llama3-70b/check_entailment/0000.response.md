Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'. The `replace` method in Python is a built-in method that replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring, which in this case is ' ' (space) with '%20'.

The annotations suggest that the function handles all possible cases, including empty strings, strings with no spaces, and strings with multiple spaces. Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function.

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the function will return "Hello%20World", which matches the problem description. Similarly, if the input string is an empty string "", the function will return an empty string "", which is also correct.

The annotations also mention that the function handles strings with multiple spaces, which is also true. For instance, if the input string is "Hello   World", the function will return "Hello%20%20%20World", replacing all spaces with '%20'.

Overall, based on the code and the annotations, it appears that the function correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.

Note: The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing examples of the function's behavior and highlighting the cases that the function is expected to handle. However, I double-checked the code to ensure that the annotations accurately describe the function's behavior.
