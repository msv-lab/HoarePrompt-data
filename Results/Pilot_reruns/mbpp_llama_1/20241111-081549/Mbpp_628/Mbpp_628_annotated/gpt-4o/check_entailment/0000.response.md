Correctness: **True**

The code provided replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20', which matches the problem description. The function uses the built-in `replace` method of Python strings, which replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space) with another value (in this case, '%20').

The annotations suggest that the function does not handle non-string inputs, but this is not a requirement in the problem description. The problem description only specifies that the function should replace all spaces in the given string with '%20', and it does not mention what should happen with non-string inputs. Therefore, the function's behavior with non-string inputs is not relevant to its correctness.

The annotations also mention that the function returns null or empty strings unchanged, and strings without spaces as they are. This is consistent with the behavior of the `replace` method, which returns the original string if no replacements are made.

Overall, the code matches the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. The annotations provide additional information about the function's behavior, but they do not reveal any cases where the function does not work as expected.
