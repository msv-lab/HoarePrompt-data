Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The function uses the built-in `replace` method of Python strings, which replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space) with another value (in this case, '%20'). 

The function is simple and straightforward, and it works correctly for all the provided test cases. Additionally, it will work correctly for any input string, regardless of the number of spaces or the length of the string. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
