Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'. The function uses the built-in `replace` method of Python strings, which replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space) with another value (in this case, '%20'). This method is efficient and correct for all possible inputs, including empty strings, strings with multiple spaces, and strings with no spaces. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
