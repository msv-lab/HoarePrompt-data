Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. The function uses recursion to traverse the nested list and append each non-list element to the `flat_list`. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself with that element as the new `nested_list`.

I have analyzed the code and could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles:

* Empty lists
* Lists with only one element
* Lists with multiple elements, including nested lists
* Lists with different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats)

The recursive approach ensures that all nested lists are properly flattened, and the `isinstance` check prevents infinite recursion.

The function also handles edge cases, such as a list containing another list as its only element, or a list containing multiple levels of nesting.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
