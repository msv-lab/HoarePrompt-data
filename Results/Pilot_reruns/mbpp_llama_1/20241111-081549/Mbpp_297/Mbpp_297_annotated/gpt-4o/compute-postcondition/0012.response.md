Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list. If an item in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the results of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` has an additional item appended to it, resulting in a flattened list of all elements from `nested_list`.***
