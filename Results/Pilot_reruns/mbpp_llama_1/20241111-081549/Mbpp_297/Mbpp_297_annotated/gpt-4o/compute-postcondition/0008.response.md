Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least one element, `flat_list` is a list. If an item in `nested_list` is a list itself, `flat_list` contains elements from the recursive call to `func_1(item)` for that item. If an item in `nested_list` is not a list, `flat_list` has one more element than before, and the new element is that item from `nested_list`. This process continues recursively until all items in `nested_list` have been processed, resulting in a flattened version of `nested_list` in `flat_list`.***
