The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists, where each nested list may also contain nested lists, and so on, and all non-list elements are of the same type. After executing the function body, the function returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, which is stored in `flat_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a nested list and return its flattened version.

Functionality: **The function accepts a nested list and returns its flattened version.**
