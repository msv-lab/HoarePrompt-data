To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will execute again. The loop iterates over the elements in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more element after the current `element`, which is the second element.

Given that `element` is the second element in `nested_list`, for the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have at least three elements. Additionally, since `element` has been processed (either appended to `flat_list` or extended with the return value of `func_1(element)` if it's a list), the next iteration should consider the next element in `nested_list` as the new `element`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements, `flat_list` is a list, and `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`.**
