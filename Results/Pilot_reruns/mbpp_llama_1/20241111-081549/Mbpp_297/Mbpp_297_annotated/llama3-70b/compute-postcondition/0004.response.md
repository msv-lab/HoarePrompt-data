Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element, `flat_list` is a list, and `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`. If `element` is a list, `flat_list` contains the output of `func_1(element)`. If `element` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the `element` itself. In both cases, `nested_list` remains unchanged.***
