Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list, and `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`. If `element` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the return value of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` is appended with `element`, effectively adding the second element of `nested_list` to `flat_list` if it is not a list itself.***
