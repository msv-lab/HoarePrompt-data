To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements.
- `flat_list` is a list.
- `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(element))
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **func_1(element)**: The function `func_1` is called with `element` as its argument. The nature of `func_1` is not specified, so we can't determine its exact output. However, we know it takes `element` (the third element of `nested_list`) as input.

2. **extend**: The `extend` method is used on `flat_list`. This method adds all the elements from the given iterable (in this case, the result of `func_1(element)`) to the end of `flat_list`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's what we can infer about the output state:

- The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The state of `element` also remains unchanged because it's used as an argument but not modified by the code snippet.
- `flat_list` is modified by extending it with the result of `func_1(element)`. Since the exact nature of `func_1` is unknown, we can only say that `flat_list` now includes additional elements that are the result of applying `func_1` to `element`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements.
- `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` includes its original elements plus the additional elements from the result of `func_1(element)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements, `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` includes its original elements plus the additional elements from the result of `func_1(element)`.**
