According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements. This means that `nested_list` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 4 elements.

Additionally, since the third element of `nested_list` has been processed in the previous iteration, the state of `nested_list` should be updated to reflect that the first three elements have been processed.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least four elements, `flat_list` is a list. If the fourth element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` includes its original elements plus the additional elements from the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the fourth element of `nested_list`.**
