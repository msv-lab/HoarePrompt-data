The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `element`, which is the second element in the `nested_list`. The return value of `func_1` is then extended to the `flat_list`. 

Since the type and value of `element` and the behavior of `func_1` are unknown, we can only describe the output state in terms of the function's return value.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is extended with the return value of `func_1(element)`, and `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`**
