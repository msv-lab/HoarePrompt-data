Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers and/or lists, and returns a new list `flat_list`.
2. The function initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
3. The function iterates over each element in `nested_list`. If the element is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that sublist and extends `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`.
4. After the loop completes, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements from `nested_list` with any sublists recursively flattened.

Now, let's analyze the code and annotations:

* The annotations state that the function returns a new list `flat_list` containing all elements from `nested_list` with any sublists recursively flattened, without modifying the original `nested_list`. This is consistent with the code.
* However, the annotations do not mention what happens if `nested_list` is empty. The code handles this case correctly, as the loop will not execute and `flat_list` will remain an empty list.
* The annotations also do not mention what happens if `func_1` is not defined or does not correctly flatten the sublists. This is a potential edge case, as the code relies on the recursive call to `func_1` to flatten the sublists. If `func_1` is not defined or does not work correctly, the function will not produce the correct result.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nested_list` that can contain integers and/or lists, and returns a new list `flat_list` containing all elements from `nested_list` with any sublists recursively flattened. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function assumes that `func_1` is defined and correctly flattens the sublists; if this is not the case, the function may not produce the correct result. **
