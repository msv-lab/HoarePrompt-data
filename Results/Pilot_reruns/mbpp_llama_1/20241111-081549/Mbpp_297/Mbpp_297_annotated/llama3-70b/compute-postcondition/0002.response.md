To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` extends the `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(element)`. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we will assume it is a function that takes an element as input and returns a list.

Since `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`, which can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element, the output of `func_1(element)` is unknown. However, we can infer that the output is a list because `flat_list.extend()` expects an iterable as an argument.

After executing the code, the `flat_list` will be extended with the output of `func_1(element)`. The state of `nested_list` and `element` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element, `flat_list` is a list that contains the output of `func_1(element)`, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`**
