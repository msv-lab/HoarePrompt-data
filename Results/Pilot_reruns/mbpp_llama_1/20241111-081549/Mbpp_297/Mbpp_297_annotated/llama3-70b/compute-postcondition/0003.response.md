To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`.

The code is:
```python
flat_list.append(element)
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- The `append` method is called on `flat_list`, which is initially empty.
- The `element` variable holds the first element of `nested_list`, which can be either an integer or a list (since `nested_list` can contain integers and/or lists).

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the first element of `nested_list`.
- The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged because the `append` operation does not modify the original list.
- The state of `element` also remains unchanged because it is not modified by the `append` operation.

Considering the possibilities for `element`, the output state can be described as follows:
- If `element` is an integer, `flat_list` will contain that integer.
- If `element` is a list, `flat_list` will contain that list as its first element.

However, since the problem statement asks for a general description of the output state without specifying the exact nature of `element`, we can conclude as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`.**
