Output State: **The loop flattens the nested_list into a one-dimensional list, flat_list. If nested_list is empty, the loop does not execute, and flat_list remains an empty list. After the loop executes, flat_list contains all elements from nested_list, with any sublists having been recursively flattened by func_1. The original nested_list remains unchanged. If func_1 is not defined or does not correctly flatten the sublists, the loop's output will be incorrect.**
