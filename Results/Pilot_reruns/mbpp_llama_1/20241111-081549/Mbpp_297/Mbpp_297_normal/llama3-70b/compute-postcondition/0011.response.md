The given code snippet is executed based on the initial state. The impact of the code on the program is that it appends the first element of `nested_list` to `flat_list`. The previous value of `flat_list` is not explicitly stated, but it is updated with the first element of `nested_list`. The state of `nested_list` is not affected. 

Since the first element of `nested_list` is either a list or not a list, the output state will have two possibilities. If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, then `flat_list` has an additional element which is the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` has an additional element which is the first element of `nested_list`.

However, in the given code snippet, `flat_list` is updated with the first element of `nested_list` regardless of whether it is a list or not. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `flat_list` has an additional element which is the first element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `flat_list` has an additional element which is the first element of `nested_list`.**
