Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements. If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is updated with the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` has an additional element which is the first element of `nested_list`, and `nested_list` has 2 remaining elements. In both cases, the first element of `nested_list` is processed and removed from `nested_list` and added to `flat_list`, resulting in `nested_list` having at least 2 elements and `flat_list` having at least one more element than before.***
