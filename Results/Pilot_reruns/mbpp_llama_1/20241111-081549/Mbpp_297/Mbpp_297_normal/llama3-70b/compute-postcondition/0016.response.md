The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists as elements, and all elements that are not lists are of the same type. After executing the function body, the function returns `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of `nested_list`, while leaving the original `nested_list` unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, a list that may contain other lists as elements with all non-list elements being of the same type, and returns its flattened version.**
