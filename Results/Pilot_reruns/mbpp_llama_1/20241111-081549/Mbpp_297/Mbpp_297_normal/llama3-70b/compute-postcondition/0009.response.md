To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for element in nested_list:`, which means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `nested_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements. This means that for the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements, since one element has already been processed.

The state of `flat_list` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements. If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is updated with the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` has an additional element which is the first element of `nested_list`.**
