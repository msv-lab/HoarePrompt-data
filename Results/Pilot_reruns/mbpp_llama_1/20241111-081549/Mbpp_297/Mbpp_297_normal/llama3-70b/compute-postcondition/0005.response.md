According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, and `flat_list` is updated based on the type of the first element in `nested_list`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements. The state of `flat_list` does not affect the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is updated based on the type of the first element in `nested_list`.**
