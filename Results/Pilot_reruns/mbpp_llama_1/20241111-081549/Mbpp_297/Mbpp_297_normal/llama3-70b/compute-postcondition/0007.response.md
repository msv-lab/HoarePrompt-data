To solve this task, we need to consider the type of the first element in `nested_list` and its impact on `flat_list`.

Since `flat_list` is updated based on the type of the first element in `nested_list`, we can assume that `flat_list` is initially empty or has some elements based on the previous operations.

The given code snippet is `flat_list.append(element)`. This line of code appends an `element` to the `flat_list`.

However, the code snippet does not specify what the `element` is. But we can infer that the `element` is likely the first element of the `nested_list` or some processed version of it, given the context of updating `flat_list` based on the type of the first element in `nested_list`.

Assuming the `element` is indeed the first element of the `nested_list` or some processed version of it, the `flat_list` will have an additional element after the execution of the code.

Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` has an additional element.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` has an additional element**
