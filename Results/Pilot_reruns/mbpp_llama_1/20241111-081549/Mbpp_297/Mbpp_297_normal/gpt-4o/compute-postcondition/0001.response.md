To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the variables involved in the loop.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the `nested_list`. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must have at least one element.

The state of `flat_list` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its state.

However, we need to introduce a new variable `item` which will take the value of the first element in the `nested_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`**
