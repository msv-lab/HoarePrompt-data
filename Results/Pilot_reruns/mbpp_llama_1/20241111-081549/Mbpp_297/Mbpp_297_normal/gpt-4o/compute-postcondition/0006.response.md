The `extend` method is called on `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)` as its argument. This means that the elements returned by `func_1(item)` are added to the end of `flat_list`. Since `item` is the second element of `nested_list`, `func_1(item)` is called with this element.

However, the output of `func_1(item)` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact elements that are added to `flat_list`. Therefore, we can only state that `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

The state of `nested_list` is not affected, and `item` is still the second element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, `item` is the second element of `nested_list`**
