To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program, considering the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least three elements.
- `flat_list` is a list.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
```

However, there seems to be a missing context or information about what `func_1(item)` does or what `item` refers to. Given the initial state, we can infer that `item` might be an element from `nested_list`, but without knowing the specifics of `func_1(item)`, we can only make a general assumption about the impact of the code.

Assuming `func_1(item)` processes each `item` from `nested_list` (or potentially another list/source, but given the context, it seems most relevant to `nested_list`) and returns a list or iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`, here's a general interpretation:

- The function `func_1(item)` is applied to each `item` (presumably from `nested_list`, though the loop or iteration mechanism is not shown in the provided snippet).
- The result of `func_1(item)` is extended into `flat_list`. This means that whatever `func_1(item)` returns (assuming it's iterable) is appended to the end of `flat_list`.

Without the specifics of `func_1(item)` and how `item` is iterated over (which could be from `nested_list` or another source not mentioned), we can say:

- `flat_list` will have its contents extended by the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` processed.
- The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as there's no operation directly modifying it in the provided snippet.

Therefore, the output state, considering the provided information and making assumptions about the context, is:

Output State: **`nested_list` remains unchanged, `flat_list` is extended by the results of `func_1(item)` for each processed item.**
