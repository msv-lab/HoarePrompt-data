To solve this task, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The function `func_1(item)` is called with `item` as its argument. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we assume it returns a list or an iterable.
- The `extend` method is used on `flat_list`, which adds all elements from the iterable returned by `func_1(item)` to the end of `flat_list`.

Given that `flat_list` is initially empty, after executing this code, `flat_list` will contain all elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

The state of `nested_list` is not affected by this code, and the value of `item` also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least one element.
- `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(item)`.
- `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least one element, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(item)`, `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`.**
