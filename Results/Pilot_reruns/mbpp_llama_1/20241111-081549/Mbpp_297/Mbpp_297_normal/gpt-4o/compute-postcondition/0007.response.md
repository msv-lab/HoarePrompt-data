The value of `item` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `item` is the second element of `nested_list`, its value is now added to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list with the second element of `nested_list` appended to it, `item` is the second element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list with the second element of `nested_list` appended to it, `item` is the second element of `nested_list`.**
