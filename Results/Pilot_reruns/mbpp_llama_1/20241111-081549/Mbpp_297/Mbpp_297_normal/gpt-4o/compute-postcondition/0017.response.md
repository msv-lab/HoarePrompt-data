Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the functionality of the function `func_1`.

The function `func_1` accepts a nested list `nested_list` as input. The function then iterates through each element in the `nested_list`. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself recursively with that element as input, effectively flattening the nested list. If an element is not a list, it is appended to the `flat_list`.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the function does not handle the case where the input `nested_list` is not a list at all. In such a case, the function will throw an error when trying to iterate over the input.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input `nested_list` contains non-list elements that are not hashable (e.g., dictionaries, sets). In such a case, the function will throw an error when trying to append these elements to the `flat_list`.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, I provide the following summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a nested list, recursively flattens it, and returns a list containing all non-list elements. However, it assumes the input is a list and may throw errors if the input is not a list or contains non-hashable non-list elements. **
