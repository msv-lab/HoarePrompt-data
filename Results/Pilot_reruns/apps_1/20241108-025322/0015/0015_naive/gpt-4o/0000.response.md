Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element `a`, then the condition `if b == a` will be true, and the program will print 'YES'. This covers the case where `b` appears in the sequence.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements of the sequence is `0` (c=0), then it is impossible for `b` to appear in the sequence because the elements will keep repeating the same value. This is handled by the condition `elif c == 0` which prints 'NO'.
3. For all other cases, the program checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. If this condition is satisfied, it means that `b` can appear in the sequence according to the sequence properties. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This logic covers all other potential cases where `b` can or cannot appear in the sequence.
