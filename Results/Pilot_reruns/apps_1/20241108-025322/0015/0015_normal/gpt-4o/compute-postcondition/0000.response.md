Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned by mapping integer inputs split by space. The initial states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping**
