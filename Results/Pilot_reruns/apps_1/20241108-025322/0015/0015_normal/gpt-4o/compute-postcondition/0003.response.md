Example Answer:
The code prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping, and the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping**
