Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
- If Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence `a`, it prints 'YES', which is in line with the problem description.
- If the difference between any two neighboring elements of the sequence `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO', as stated in the problem description.
- If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is met, it prints 'YES'. This condition correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number `b` can appear in the sequence with the given conditions.
- In all other cases, it prints 'NO', which is also consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
