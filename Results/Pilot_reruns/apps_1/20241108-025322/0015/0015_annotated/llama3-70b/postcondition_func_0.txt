The function reads three integers from user input and based on the conditions on these numbers, prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If c is 0 and a equals b, 'YES' is printed; if a is not equal to b, 'NO' is printed. If c is not 0, the function checks if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
