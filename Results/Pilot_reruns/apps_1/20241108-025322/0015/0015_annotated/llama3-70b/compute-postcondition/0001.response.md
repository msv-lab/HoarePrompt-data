Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints out the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the variables `a`, `b`, or `c` which were assigned values based on user input. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input**
