Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input, but the code snippet does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input**
