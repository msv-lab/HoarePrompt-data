Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the valid range, but their values are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the valid range.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the valid range**
