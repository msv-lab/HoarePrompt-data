Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input as an integer. Since the precondition states that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 3, the possible values for `n` are 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3)**
