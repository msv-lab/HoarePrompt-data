Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list with '0' removed. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop doesn't execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. `max_num` is an integer created by sorting the digits in descending order and converting them into an integer. The code prints `max_num`.**
