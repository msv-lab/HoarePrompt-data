Example Answer:
The code removes the digit '0' from the set `digits`. If the set `digits` contains the digit '0', it will be removed. If the set `digits` is empty, then nothing happens since there is no digit '0' to remove. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, with the digit '0' removed if it was present.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, with the digit '0' removed if it was present**
