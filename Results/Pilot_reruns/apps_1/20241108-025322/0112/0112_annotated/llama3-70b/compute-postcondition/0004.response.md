Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the first list `cube` and converts it to a string before updating the `digits` set with those digits. The variable `cube` is the first list in the `cubes` list. The set `digits` will be updated with all the digits from the integers in the list `cube`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the first list in the `cubes` list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the first list in the `cubes` list**
