According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, and `i` is less than `n+1`**
