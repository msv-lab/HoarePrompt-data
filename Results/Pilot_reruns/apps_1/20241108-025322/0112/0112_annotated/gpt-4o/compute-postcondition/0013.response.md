Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, and `i` is less than `n-1`. After the execution of the if statement, if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop breaks. All other variables remain unchanged.***
