According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more digits in the list `digits` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is less than `n` and incremented by 1 on each iteration. Since `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, the loop can execute one more time if there are more digits left to iterate over. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the `digits` list should have more than 1 digit left.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with more than 1 digit left, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
