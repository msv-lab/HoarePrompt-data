According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the list `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, the `n` value, the number of lists in `cube_faces`, and `num` will remain unchanged. The list `digits` will still have more than 1 digit left, and the next digit to be processed is `digit`. The list `used_cubes` will not change. The `found` state will still be False. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the adjustment needed is that the next digit in the list `digits` should be considered.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with more than 1 digit left, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
