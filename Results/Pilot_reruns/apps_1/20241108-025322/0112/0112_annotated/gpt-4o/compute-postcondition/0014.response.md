According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, and `i` is less than `n-1`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to be less than `n`.
- `found` should be set to False to indicate that the loop can continue.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, and `i` is less than `n`**
