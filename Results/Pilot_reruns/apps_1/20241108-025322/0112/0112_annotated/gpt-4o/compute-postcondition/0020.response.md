Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if the condition is met, `i` is less than `n` and incremented by 1 on each iteration. If no cube satisfies the condition, `found` remains False, and all other variables retain their original values.**
