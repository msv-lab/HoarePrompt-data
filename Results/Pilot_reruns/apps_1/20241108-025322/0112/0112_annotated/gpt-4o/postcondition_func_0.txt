The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n representing the number of cubes Masha has and a list of lists containing the faces of each cube. It then iterates over values of x starting from 0 and increments x until the can_form_number(x+1) function returns False. The function returns the final value of x after the loop. If can_form_number() always returns False, x remains 0. The values in cube_faces are converted into sets.
