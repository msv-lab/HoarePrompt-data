According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, 'cube' is the second cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 cubes, and 'cube' should now be the third cube in the list.
State: **n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', and 'cube' is the third cube in the list**
