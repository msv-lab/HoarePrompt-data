Example Answer:
The code takes n as input and creates a list of n cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers obtained from splitting the input. Since n is between 1 and 3 inclusive, the input will be valid. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers**
