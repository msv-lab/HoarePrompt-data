According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 to guarantee one more iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, `found` is False**
