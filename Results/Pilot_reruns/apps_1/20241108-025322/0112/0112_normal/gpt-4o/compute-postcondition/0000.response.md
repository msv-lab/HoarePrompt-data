Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of strings obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string. The value of `num` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cube, and `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cube, and `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string**
