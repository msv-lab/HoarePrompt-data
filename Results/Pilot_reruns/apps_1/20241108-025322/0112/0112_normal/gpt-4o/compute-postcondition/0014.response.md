According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where only the element at index `i` is True, `found` is True. Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where only the element at index `i` is True, `found` is True**
