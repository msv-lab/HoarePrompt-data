Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in `used_cubes` list is assigned the value True. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the element at index `i` set to True, `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the element at index `i` set to True, `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False**
