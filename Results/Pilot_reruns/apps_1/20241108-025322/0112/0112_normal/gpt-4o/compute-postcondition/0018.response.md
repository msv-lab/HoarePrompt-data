Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where only the element at index `i` is True, `found` is True. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. This ensures that after the execution, the state remains consistent with the preconditions and the specified conditions within the if statement are met.***
