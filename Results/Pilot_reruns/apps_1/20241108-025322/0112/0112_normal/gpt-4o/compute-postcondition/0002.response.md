According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the loop needs to know the specific `digit` it is iterating over. 

So, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cube, `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements initialized to False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
