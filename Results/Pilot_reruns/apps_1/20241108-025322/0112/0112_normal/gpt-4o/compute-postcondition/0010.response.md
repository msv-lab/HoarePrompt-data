Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to True. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` greater than 1, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, and `found` is False. After execution, the value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to True.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with one True value at index i, `found` is False**
