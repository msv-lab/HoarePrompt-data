According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` has at least one element set to True, `found` is False, and `digits` list has more elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must have even more elements.
State: **`used_cubes` has at least one element set to True, `found` is False, `digits` list has even more elements**
