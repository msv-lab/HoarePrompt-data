Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in the list `used_cubes` is set to True. Since only the element at index `i` is True and the list has n elements, all other elements remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with only the element at index `i` as True, `found` is True.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with only the element at index `i` as True, `found` is True**
