According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, the variable `used_cubes` will have at least one element set to True where the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. The variable `found` will be True if the condition is met. If the condition is not met for any of the cubes, `found` will remain False. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and there will be no changes to any variables. After the if statement executes, if `found` is False, the function returns False.

At the end of the last iteration, the states are not provided. So, assuming the initial states before the loop starts:
State: **`used_cubes` has at least one element set to True, `found` is True**
