Example Answer:
Each element in the `used_cubes` list is initialized to `False`, and the length of the list is `n`, which represents the number of cubes Masha has. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cube, `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements initialized to False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cube, `digits` is a list of strings obtained by converting an unknown integer `num` to a string, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements initialized to False**
