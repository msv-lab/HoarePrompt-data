Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions where `func_1` calculates the smallest number that can be formed using the digits on the cubes and `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces.
- The `func_1` function iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it finds the smallest number that can be formed using the digits on the cubes.
- The `can_form_number` function iterates through the digits of a given number and tries to find a cube face that contains that digit. If at least one cube face matches a digit, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
- The code handles the case where Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.
- The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases and the examples provided. The output hints also support the correctness of the code by explaining how the functions work and what they are intended to do.

Therefore, based on the code logic, problem description, and output hints, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
