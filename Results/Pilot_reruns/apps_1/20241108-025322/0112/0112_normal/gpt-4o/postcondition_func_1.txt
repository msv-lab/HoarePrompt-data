The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` representing the number of cubes Masha has. It then iterates through the digits of `num` and tries to find a cube face that contains that digit. If at least one cube face matches a digit, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function relies on global variables `n` and `cube_faces` to be defined. It iterates through the cubes to check if any cube can form the given number based on certain conditions. If no cube satisfies the conditions, the function returns False.
