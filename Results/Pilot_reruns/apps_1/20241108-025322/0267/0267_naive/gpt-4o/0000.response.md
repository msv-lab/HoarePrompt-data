Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It uses two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to check if a number has at most $k$ different digits and then calculates the total sum accordingly. The program iterates through all numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition. The modulo operation is also correctly applied to the total sum. The program passes all the provided examples and logic seems correct for all potential cases.
