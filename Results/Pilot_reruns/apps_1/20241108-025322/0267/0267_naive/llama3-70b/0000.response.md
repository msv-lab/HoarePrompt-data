Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The count function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits within a given range. The main function then calculates the sum by taking the difference of counts for $r$ and $l-1$, and returns the result modulo $998244353$. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The code also handles large input values efficiently using dynamic programming.
