Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `count` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The `count` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers within the specified constraints and handles the cases where `n` is less than `10^k` and where `n` is not less than `10^k`.
- The `func_1` function utilizes the `count` function to calculate the final result as (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the specified bounds.
- The code handles the input constraints and performs the required calculations to find the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` with at most `k` different digits.
- There are no cases found where the program does not follow the problem description, and all provided examples seem to work correctly.
