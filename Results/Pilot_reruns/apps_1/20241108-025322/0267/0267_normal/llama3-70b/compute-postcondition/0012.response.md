According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation, i is 3. Since i is 3 and the loop is iterating from 1 to k (exclusive), the loop needs to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation, i is 4**
