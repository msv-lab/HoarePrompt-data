According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to `k-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the calculated value, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is assigned the calculated value, i is 2**
