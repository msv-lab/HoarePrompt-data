Example Answer: 
`dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is unknown, and `i` is 2. After the calculation, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the calculation, i is 2.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the calculation, i is 2**
