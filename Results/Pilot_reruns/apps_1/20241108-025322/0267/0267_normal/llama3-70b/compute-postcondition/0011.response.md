Example Answer:
The `dp[n, k]` value is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `i` is 3. Given the initial state, the output state would be: n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation, i is 3.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation, i is 3**
