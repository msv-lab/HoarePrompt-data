Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it, then taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`. Since `num` is equal to `l`, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the formula (total_sum + l) % MOD, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is `l`**
