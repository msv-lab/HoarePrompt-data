Example Answer:
The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so `(num + 1)` becomes the new value of `num`. Then, `total_sum` is updated by adding the new value of `num` to it and taking the modulo `MOD` of the result. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `(num + 1)` where `num` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `(num + 1)` where `num` is incremented by 1**
