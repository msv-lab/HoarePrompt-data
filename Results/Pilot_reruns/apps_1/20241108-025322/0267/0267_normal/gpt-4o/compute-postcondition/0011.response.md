Output State: **If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop won't execute and `total_sum` will remain 0. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop will iterate through each `num` in the range `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a specific `num`, then `total_sum` will be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. After the loop finishes, `total_sum`, `l`, and `r` will retain their integer values.**
