According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to be equal to (total_sum + l) % MOD, where `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `num` is equal to `l`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers**
