Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits.
2. The function uses a nested function `count` to calculate the count of valid numbers within a range.
3. The function `count` uses dynamic programming to optimize the calculation by storing previously computed values in the dictionary `dp`.
4. The main function calculates the result by subtracting the count of valid numbers from $1$ to $(l-1)$ from the count of valid numbers from $1$ to $r$.
5. The result is taken modulo $998244353$ as required.
6. The program takes input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all given examples. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.
