According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `i` is equal to `k-1`. Since the loop condition is `i < k`, the value of `i` should be updated to `k` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `i` is equal to `k`, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression**
