Output State: 
- If k is equal to 0: dp[n, k] is 0
- If k is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10: dp[n, k] is updated based on the expression dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1), where l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and 1 <= k <= 10.
- dp[n, k] is then taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **dp[n, k] is updated based on the given expression and taken modulo MOD**
