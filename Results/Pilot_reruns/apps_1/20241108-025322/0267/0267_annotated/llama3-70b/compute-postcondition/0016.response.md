Postcondition: ***l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the corresponding value from dp. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n` if n < 10 ** k, otherwise dp[n, k] is updated based on the given expression and taken modulo MOD. The updated value of dp[n, k] considers all possible edge cases and correctly handles the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
