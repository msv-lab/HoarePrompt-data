According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to `k` after the last iteration.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `i` is equal to `k`**
