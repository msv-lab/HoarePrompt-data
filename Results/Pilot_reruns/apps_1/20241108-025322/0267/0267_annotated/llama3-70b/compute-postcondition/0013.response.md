Output State: **If k is equal to 0, dp[n, k] is 0. If k is greater than 0, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the value of dp[n, k] is updated based on the given expression after the loop executes. If k is greater than 10, the loop does not execute, and there is no change to the values of l, r, k, or dp[n, k].**
