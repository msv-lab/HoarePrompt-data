Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated by adding `l` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. Regardless of the condition, the initial state of `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` remains unchanged.***
