Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then the new value of `total_sum` is calculated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The relationships between `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` are maintained, ensuring that `l` remains less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is updated accordingly. No changes occur if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false.***
