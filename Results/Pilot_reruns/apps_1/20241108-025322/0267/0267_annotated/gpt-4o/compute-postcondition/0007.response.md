According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then the new value of `total_sum` is calculated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The relationships between `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` are maintained, ensuring that `l` remains less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is updated accordingly. No changes occur if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false.

To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` should be considered. If `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, then `num` can be incremented by 1. If `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to false, then `num` should not be incremented.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1 or remains the same based on the evaluation of `func_1(num + 1, k)`, ensuring the relationship between `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` is maintained**
