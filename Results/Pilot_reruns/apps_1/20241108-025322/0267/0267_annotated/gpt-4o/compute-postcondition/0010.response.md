According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the range of `num` from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers, and the relationship between `l`, `r`, and `num` is maintained as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next value within the range `[l, r]`.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` where `num + 1` is within the range `[l, r]`**
