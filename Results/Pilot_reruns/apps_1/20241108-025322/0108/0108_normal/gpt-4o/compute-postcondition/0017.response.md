Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `target`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: If the length of `s` is less than 26, the loop will stop execution before reaching the end of `target`. `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be the number of matching characters between `s` and `target`. If `s` contains all 26 letters of `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be 26.
Output State: **If the length of `s` is less than 26, the loop will stop execution before reaching the end of `target`. `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be the number of matching characters between `s` and `target`. If `s` contains all 26 letters of `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be 26.**
