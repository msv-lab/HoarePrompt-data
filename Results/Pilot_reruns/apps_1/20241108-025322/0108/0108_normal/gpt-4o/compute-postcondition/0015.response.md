According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target` (which is 26), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2 and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. If `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` matches `target[j]` and `j` is 1, `j` is increased by 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be increased by 2 more, and `j` should be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 4, and `j` is adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above.**
