Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` containing lowercase English letters of variable length. It then iterates through `s` and checks if it contains all 26 letters of the alphabet represented by `target`. If it does, it prints out the string `target`. If not, it prints -1. The function does not have a return value explicitly stated in the annotations. There is a missing edge case where the function should handle scenarios where `s` does not contain all the letters of the alphabet.**
