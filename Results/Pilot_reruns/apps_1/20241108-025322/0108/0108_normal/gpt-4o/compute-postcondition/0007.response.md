According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was increased by 1 and `j` was either 0 or 1 depending on the match of `s[i]` with `target[j]`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`.
- `j` needs to be less than `target_len`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` matches `target[j]`.**
