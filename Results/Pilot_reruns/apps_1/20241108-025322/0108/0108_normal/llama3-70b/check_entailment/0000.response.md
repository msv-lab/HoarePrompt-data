Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` and iterates through the alphabet, replacing characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet.
- It then checks if the resulting string `res` contains all characters from the alphabet.
- If the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet), it prints the string.
- If the length is not 26, it prints -1.
- The code fulfills the requirements of the problem description by ensuring that the resulting string contains all characters of the English alphabet as a subsequence.
