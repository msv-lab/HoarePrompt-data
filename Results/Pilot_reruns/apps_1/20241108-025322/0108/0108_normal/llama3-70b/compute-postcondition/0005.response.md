Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is being replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The `replace` function replaces only the first occurrence of `char` with the new character. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string.
Output State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string**
