According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` appended to it, and `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the next character in the ASCII sequence after `char` should be in `s`. 
State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence and the next character in the ASCII sequence after `char` is also in `s**.
