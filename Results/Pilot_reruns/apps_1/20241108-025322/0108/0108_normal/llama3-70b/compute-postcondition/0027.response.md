Example Answer:
The `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character obtained by incrementing its ASCII value by 1. The `replace` function replaces only the first occurrence of `char` in `s`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `res` will have `char` appended to it.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it**
