Example Answer:
`char` is added to `res`, where `char` is the next character in the alphabet from the last replacement. The modified `s` already has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and `char` is present in the modified `s`. Therefore, after execution, the updated `res` will contain the next character in the alphabet after `char`.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`**
