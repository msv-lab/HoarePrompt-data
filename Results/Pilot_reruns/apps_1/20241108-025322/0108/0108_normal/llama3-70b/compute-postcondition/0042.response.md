Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, iterates through the alphabet, and replaces characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If `s` contains all characters from the alphabet, it prints the resulting string. If the length of the resulting string is 26, it prints the string; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value directly.**
