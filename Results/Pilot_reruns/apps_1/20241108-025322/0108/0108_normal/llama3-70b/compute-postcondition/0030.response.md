Example Answer: 
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The `char` variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot provide the specific value that is being replaced. The output state will be: `res` will have `char` appended to it.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it**
