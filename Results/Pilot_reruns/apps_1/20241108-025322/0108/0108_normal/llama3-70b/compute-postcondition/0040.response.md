Postcondition: ***If `s` is empty or `alphabet` is empty, the loop does not execute. If `s` contains any characters not present in `alphabet`, the loop does not execute. If `s` contains all characters from `alphabet`, `res` will contain all characters from `alphabet` in order. After the loop, `s` will have all characters replaced with the next character in the alphabet. `alphabet` will contain all lowercase English letters, and `char` will be the last character in the `alphabet` string. If the length of `res` is 26, `res` is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed.***
