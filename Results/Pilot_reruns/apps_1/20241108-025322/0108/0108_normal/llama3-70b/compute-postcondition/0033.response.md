Example Answer: 
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The `replace` function modifies the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` will have `char` appended to it, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence**
