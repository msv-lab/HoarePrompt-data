Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the alphabet characters and checks if each character is present in the input string. If found, it appends the character to the result string and replaces that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. This process continues until all alphabet characters are processed. Finally, it checks if the length of the result string is 26 (the length of the alphabet) and prints the result if it is, otherwise prints -1. This logic ensures that the output string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program handles all cases where it is possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence from the given input string.
