Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and checks if it forms a subsequence of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If it does, it prints out the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of comparing characters and incrementing indices is sound and will output the correct result for all potential cases.
