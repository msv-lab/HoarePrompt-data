Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input string `s` and checks if it can be transformed into the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence. It iterates through both strings, incrementing the indices when characters match. If at the end of the iteration the index `j` reaches the length of the target string, it means the transformation is possible and the target string is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases, ensuring correctness.
