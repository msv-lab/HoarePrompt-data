The function takes an input string consisting of only lowercase English letters and manipulates it by replacing each character with the character that comes after it in the alphabet until the last character in the input string. If the resulting string contains all characters in the alphabet in order, it prints the modified string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function operates on strings of length between 1 and 10^5.
