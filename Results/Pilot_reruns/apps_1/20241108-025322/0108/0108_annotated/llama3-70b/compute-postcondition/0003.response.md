Since the loop iterates over the characters in the `alphabet`, the loop will execute as long as `alphabet` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `alphabet` is not empty. Additionally, at the beginning of the loop, `char` will represent the first character in the `alphabet`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
