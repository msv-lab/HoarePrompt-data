According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. If `s` contains `char`, the loop will iterate again until the next character after the last iteration of `char`. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` contains the next character after the last iteration of `char`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` should contain the next character after the last iteration of `char`.
State: **If `s` contains the next character after the last iteration of `char`, `res` will contain the characters of `alphabet` in sequence until the next character after the last iteration of `char`, `s` will be modified accordingly.**
