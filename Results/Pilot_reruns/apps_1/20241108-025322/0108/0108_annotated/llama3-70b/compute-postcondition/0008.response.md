Example Answer:
The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet using the `replace` function. Since `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, the first occurrence of `char` will be replaced with the next character after `char` in the alphabet. After execution, `s` is modified accordingly. The other variables `res` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
