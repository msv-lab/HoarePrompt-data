Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with `char`, so the new value of `res` will be the original value of `res` followed by the value of `char`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
