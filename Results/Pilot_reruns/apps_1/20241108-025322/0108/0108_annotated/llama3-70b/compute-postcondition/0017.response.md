According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains `char` and `res` contains the characters of `alphabet` in sequence until the next character after the last iteration of `char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be modified so that it does not contain the characters up to the next character after the last iteration of `char`, and there should be at least one more occurrence of `char` in `s` for the loop to continue.

State: **If `s` contains `char` again, then `res` will contain the characters of `alphabet` in sequence until the next character after the last iteration of `char`, `s` will be modified accordingly**.
