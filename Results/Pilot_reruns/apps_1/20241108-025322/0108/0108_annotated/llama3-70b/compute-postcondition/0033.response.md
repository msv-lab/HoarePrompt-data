Example Answer:
The `char` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, and only the first occurrence is replaced. The updated string `s` is assigned the result. The values of `res` and `char` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the updated string after adding `char` to it, `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`res` is the updated string after adding `char` to it, `char` is still in `s`**
