Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The value of `char` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact result. Therefore, the output state is: `res` will have `char` added to it, `s` will be modified accordingly.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` added to it, `s` will be modified accordingly**
