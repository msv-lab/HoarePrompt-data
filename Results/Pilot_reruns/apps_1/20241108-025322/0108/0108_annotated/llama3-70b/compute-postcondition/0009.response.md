According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `char`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, and `char` is the first character in `alphabet`. Since we need to find the next occurrence of `char` in `s`, the modified `s` should still contain `char`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
