Example Answer:
The `char` variable is used to replace a character in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the ASCII table. The `replace` function replaces only the first occurrence of `char` in `s`. The state of `res` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`res` is appended with the value of `char`**
