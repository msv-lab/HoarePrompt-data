Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced by the character next to it in ASCII value in the string `s`. The string `s` is modified accordingly. The previous values of `res` and `char` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` has `char` added to it, `s` is modified accordingly.
Output State: **`res` has `char` added to it, `s` is modified accordingly**
