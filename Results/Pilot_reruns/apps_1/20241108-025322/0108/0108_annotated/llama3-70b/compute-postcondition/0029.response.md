Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char` where `char` is still in `s`. The new value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` concatenated with the value of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the value of `char`, and `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the value of `char`, and `char` is still in `s`**
