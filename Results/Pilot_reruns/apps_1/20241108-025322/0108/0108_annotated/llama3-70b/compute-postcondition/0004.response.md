Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, which is the first character in `alphabet`. Since `res` was initially empty and `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, the resulting value of `res` is the same as `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is the first character in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is the first character in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
