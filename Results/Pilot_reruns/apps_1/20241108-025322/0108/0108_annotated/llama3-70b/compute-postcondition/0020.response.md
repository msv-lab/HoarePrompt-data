According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` added to it. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` will have `char` added to it, `s` will be modified accordingly**
