Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The character `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, so it will be replaced with the character that comes after it. The length of `s` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
