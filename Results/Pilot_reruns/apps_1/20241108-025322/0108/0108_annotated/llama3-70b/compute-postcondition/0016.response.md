Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, then `res` will contain the characters of `alphabet` in sequence until the next character after the last iteration of `char`, `s` will be modified accordingly. If `s` does not contain the next character after the last iteration of `char`, `res` remains empty. The loop will end when the next character after the last iteration of `char` exceeds the characters in `alphabet`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged.**
