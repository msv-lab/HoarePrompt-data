Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is 26, i is 1, j is either incremented by 1 if s[i] is equal to target[j] or remains unchanged.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is 26, i is 1, j is either incremented by 1 if s[i] is equal to target[j] or remains unchanged**
