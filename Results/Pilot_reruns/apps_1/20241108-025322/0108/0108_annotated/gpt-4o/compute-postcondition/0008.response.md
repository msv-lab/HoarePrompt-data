Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged. The previous values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, `i`, and `j` are given. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is either incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]` or remains unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is either incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]` or remains unchanged**
