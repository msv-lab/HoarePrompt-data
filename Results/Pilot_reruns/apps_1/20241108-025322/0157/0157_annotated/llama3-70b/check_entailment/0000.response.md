Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. The code calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used to cook the compote based on the ratios given in the problem description. However, it does not take into account the total number of apples and pears that Nikolay has. 

For example, if the input is:
2
3
2

The code will output 2, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, Nikolay should have at least 2 apples and 4 pears to make the compote, but he only has 3 apples and 2 pears in this case.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
