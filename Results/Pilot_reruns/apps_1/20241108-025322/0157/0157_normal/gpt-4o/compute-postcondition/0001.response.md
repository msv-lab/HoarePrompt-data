Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `a` and `c` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. 
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
