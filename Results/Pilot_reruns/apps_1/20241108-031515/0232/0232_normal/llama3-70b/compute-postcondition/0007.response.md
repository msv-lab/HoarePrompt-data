Example Answer:
The code increments the count of the specific color in color_counts by 1. If the color is not already in color_counts, it is added with a value of 0. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive. If color is not already in color_counts, the color is added to color_counts with a value of 0.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive.
