Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean that is True if all the counts in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding targets in the `counts` list. `i` is 0, `n` is 0, `window_counts` contains `color` as a key with a value of 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1+1]`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts` before the execution of the if statement, it is added as a key with the value 0 in the dictionary.***
