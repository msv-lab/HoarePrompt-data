Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value of 0 or 1 based on whether `color` was already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to the current index in the loop, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `color` is added to `window_counts` with a count value of 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.***
