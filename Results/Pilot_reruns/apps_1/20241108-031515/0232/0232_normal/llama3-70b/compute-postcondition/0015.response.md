Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `color_counts[color]` is unknown, so the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of at least n+1 integers representing colors of lightsabers, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. If color is not already in color_counts, the color is added to color_counts with a value of 0. 
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of at least n+1 integers representing colors of lightsabers, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. If color is not already in color_counts, the color is added to color_counts with a value of 0.**
