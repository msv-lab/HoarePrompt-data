Example Answer: 
The list `counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The input is taken from the user and converted to a list of integers. The previous values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, each color being in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, each color being in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive**
