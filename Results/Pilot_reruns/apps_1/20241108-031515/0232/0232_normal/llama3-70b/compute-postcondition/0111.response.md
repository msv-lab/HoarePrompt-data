Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. `i` is the current index of the outer loop. `n` is the total number of elements in `colors`. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing counts of colors in the current window. `j` is the current index of the inner loop. `color` is assigned the color at index `j` in `colors`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the initial state variables remain unchanged. If `found` is True at any point, the loop breaks out, maintaining the state. If `found` is False throughout the loop, the loop continues until completion, and the state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop finishes executing.**
