Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated value of either 2 if `color` was already present or 1 if `color` was not in `window_counts`, `j` is 2, `color` remains the same. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, `i` remains 0, `n` stays greater than 0, `window_counts` maintains the key `color` with the updated value, `j` remains 2, and `color` is unchanged. The loop or if statement is broken out of after this condition is met.***
