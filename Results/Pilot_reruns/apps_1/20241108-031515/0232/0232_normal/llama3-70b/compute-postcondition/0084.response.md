Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value, `j` is equal to the current index in the loop, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary, and if `color` was not in `window_counts` initially, then it is added with a count value of 0.***
