Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean that is True if all the counts in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding targets in the `counts` list. `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and value 1 if `color` was not present in `window_counts` before the execution of the if statement, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
