Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum value between the two inputs, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`, which further supports the correctness of the code. Since the code logic matches the problem description and there are no conflicting cases identified, the code is considered correct.
