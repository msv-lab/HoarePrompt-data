Example Answer: 
The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. The initial states of `a` and `b` are integers, so the function will return the maximum of the two integers. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b**.
