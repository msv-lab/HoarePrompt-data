Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the built-in `max()` function. This implementation correctly follows the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. For every potential case, the program will return the correct maximum value. Hence, the program is correct.
