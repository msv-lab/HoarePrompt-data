Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater value between them using a ternary operator. The function is then tested with three different test cases, and in each case, the expected output matches the output produced by the function. The code meets the problem description by correctly identifying and returning the maximum of the two input numbers, as required. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the code would fail to produce the correct output. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that the function `func_1` indeed returns the greater value between `a` and `b`.
