Example Answer: 
The code returns the greater value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is returned. If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `b` is returned. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers and the function returns the greater value between them.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers and the function returns the greater value between them**
