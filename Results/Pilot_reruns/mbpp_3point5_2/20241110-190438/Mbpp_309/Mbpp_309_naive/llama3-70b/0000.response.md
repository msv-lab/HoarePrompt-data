Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` simply uses the `max` function in Python to return the maximum of two numbers `a` and `b`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. The program covers all potential cases where it will return the correct maximum of the two input numbers. Hence, the code is correct.
