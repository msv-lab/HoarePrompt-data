Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Additionally, the output hints also support this by stating that the function returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no apparent edge cases where it might fail, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
