Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. The function simply uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element, which is a correct and efficient way to solve the problem. The code aligns perfectly with the problem description and the output hints. Additionally, the provided test cases also confirm that the function is working as expected for different inputs. Hence, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
