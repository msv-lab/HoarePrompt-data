Example Answer:
The function returns the number of occurrences of the given element in the tuple `tup`. The count is calculated based on the initial state of the tuple and the element provided. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: `tup` is a tuple and `element` is any data type.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple and `element` is any data type**
