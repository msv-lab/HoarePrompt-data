The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `element`, which can be any data type. After executing the function body, the function does not have a specific return value specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element of any data type, but it does not return any specific value.
