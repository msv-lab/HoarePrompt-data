Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string by iterating over the characters in the input string and only keeping the uppercase characters. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. Since the logic of the code aligns with the problem requirements and there are no edge cases where the program would not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
