Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters removed. It achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, checking if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and only including the character in the output if it is uppercase.

The program then includes three test cases to verify the correctness of the function, and all test cases pass successfully. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided test cases, the program is correct.
