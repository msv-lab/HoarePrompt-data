Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description. The program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided function only returns the uppercase characters from the input string. It does not actually remove the lowercase substrings as required in the problem description.

For example, if the input string is "HeLLo WoRld", the expected output should be "HLL WR", where the lowercase letters "e", "o", and "ld" are removed. However, the given program will output "HLR", which does not meet the requirements.
