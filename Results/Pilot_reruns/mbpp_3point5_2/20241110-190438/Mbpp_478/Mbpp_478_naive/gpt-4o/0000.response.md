Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from the given string, but it actually returns only the uppercase characters from the input string. This means that the function doesn't remove the lowercase substrings as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
