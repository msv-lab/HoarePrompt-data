Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string by only keeping the uppercase characters. The code iterates through each character in the input string and concatenates only the uppercase characters into a new string. 

The problem description is to remove lowercase substrings from the given string, and the code does exactly that by only keeping the uppercase characters. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns a string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string.

There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that the code does not handle, and based on the provided code and problem description, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
