Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`. The function iterates through each character in the input string `s` and concatenates only the uppercase characters into a new string. It does not handle cases where `s` is empty or does not contain any uppercase characters.**
