Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns the polar coordinates of that complex number. The program uses the `abs()` function to calculate the magnitude of the complex number and the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase angle of the complex number. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. The program will work correctly for all complex numbers provided as input.
