Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number as input and returns its polar coordinates (magnitude, phase angle) using the `cmath.polar` function. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns the polar coordinates of the input complex number.

Since the code matches the problem description and the annotations, and there are no examples provided where the program may fail to produce the correct output, we can conclude that the program is correct in converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.
