Example Answer:
The function `polar()` from the `cmath` module is used to convert a complex number into its polar coordinates, which include the magnitude and phase angle. The code returns the polar coordinates of the complex number `num`. Since the initial state specifies that `num` is a complex number, the output state will depend on the polar coordinates of that specific complex number.
Output State: **The function returns the polar coordinates (magnitude, phase angle) of the complex number `num`.**
