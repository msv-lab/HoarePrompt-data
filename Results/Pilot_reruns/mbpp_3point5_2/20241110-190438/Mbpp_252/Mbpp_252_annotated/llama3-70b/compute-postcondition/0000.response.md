Example Answer: 
The function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. Since the initial state is that `c` is a complex number, the absolute value and phase of `c` can vary depending on the specific complex number. Therefore, the output state is `c` is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`.
Output State: **`c` is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`**
