The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number represented by `num`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a complex number `num` and return a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, which is a complex number, and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number represented by num.**
