Example Answer: 
The function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c` using the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions respectively. Since the initial state mentions that `c` is a complex number, the absolute value and phase of `c` can vary. Therefore, the output state is: c is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value and phase of `c`.
Output State: **c is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value and phase of `c`**
