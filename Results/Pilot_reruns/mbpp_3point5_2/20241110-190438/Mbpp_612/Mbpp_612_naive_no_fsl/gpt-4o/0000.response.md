Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The provided test cases cover different types of input lists - lists with strings, lists with integers, and lists with sublists. In each case, the function correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns the expected output. Therefore, based on the provided test cases, the program is correct.
