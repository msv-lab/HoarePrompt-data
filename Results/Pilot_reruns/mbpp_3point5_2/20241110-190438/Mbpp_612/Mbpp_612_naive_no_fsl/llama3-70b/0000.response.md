Correctness: **True**

The program takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. This logic is implemented correctly and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
