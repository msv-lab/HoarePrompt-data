The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then generates two lists: first_elements and second_elements, containing the first and second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists, respectively. Finally, the function returns a list containing first_elements and second_elements.
