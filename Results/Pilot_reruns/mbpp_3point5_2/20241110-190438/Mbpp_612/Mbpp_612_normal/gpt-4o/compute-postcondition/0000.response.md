Example Answer:
The code extracts the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and stores them in the `first_elements` list. Since each sublist contains exactly two elements, the first elements are successfully extracted. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist**
