Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements. It then generates two lists, `first_elements` and `second_elements`, containing the first and second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, respectively. Finally, the function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`. 

The code works correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description. It accurately extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns a list of two lists as expected. The code also passes all the provided test cases, which further confirms its correctness. The output hints also align with the actual code functionality, supporting the correctness of the program.
