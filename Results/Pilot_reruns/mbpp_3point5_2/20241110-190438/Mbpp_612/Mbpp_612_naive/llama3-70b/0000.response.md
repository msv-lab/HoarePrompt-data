Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second list has the second element. The program uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements from each sublist and then constructs two separate lists containing these elements. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description. Additionally, the program is concise and easy to understand, making it an efficient solution for the given problem.
