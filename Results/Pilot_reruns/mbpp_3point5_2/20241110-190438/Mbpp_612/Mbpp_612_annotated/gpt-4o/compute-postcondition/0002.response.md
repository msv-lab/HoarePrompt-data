Example Answer:
The function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`. These variables contain the first and second elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` contains the first elements of all sublists, `second_elements` contains the second elements of all sublists.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` contains the first elements of all sublists, `second_elements` contains the second elements of all sublists**
