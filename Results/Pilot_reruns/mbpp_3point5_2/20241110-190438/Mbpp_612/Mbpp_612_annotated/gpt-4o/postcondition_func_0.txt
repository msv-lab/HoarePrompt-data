The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then creates two new lists: first_elements containing the first elements of all sublists, and second_elements containing the second elements of all sublists. The function returns these two lists. The code aligns with the annotations provided.
