Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code has an issue when removing the last occurrence of the character. The slicing operation `s[last_occ + 1:]` includes all characters after the last occurrence, but it should only exclude the last occurrence itself.
- For example, if we input `s = "hello"`, `c = "l"`, the code will return "heo" instead of "helo" as expected. This shows that the code does not handle the last occurrence removal correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
