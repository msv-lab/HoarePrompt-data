Example Answer:
`first_occ` is assigned the value of the first occurrence of character `c` in string `s` using the `find()` method. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will be the index where `c` is first found. If `c` is not found in `s`, `first_occ` will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a character, and first_occ is either the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a character, and first_occ is either the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1**
