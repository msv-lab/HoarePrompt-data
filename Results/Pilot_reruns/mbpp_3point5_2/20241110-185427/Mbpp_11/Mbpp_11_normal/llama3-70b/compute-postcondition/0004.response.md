Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns a modified string formed by removing the character at the index `first_occ` and `last_occ` from `s`. Otherwise, the function returns the original string `s`.***
