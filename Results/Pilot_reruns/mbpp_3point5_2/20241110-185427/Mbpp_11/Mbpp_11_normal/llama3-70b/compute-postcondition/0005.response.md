The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `c`. `s` is a string and `c` is a character. The function also returns two values: `first_occ`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, and `last_occ`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1. 

If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns a modified string formed by removing the character at the index `first_occ` and `last_occ` from `s`. Otherwise, the function returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, find the first and last occurrences of the character `c` in the string `s`, and return a modified string with the character removed if both occurrences are found. If either occurrence is not found, the original string `s` is returned.
