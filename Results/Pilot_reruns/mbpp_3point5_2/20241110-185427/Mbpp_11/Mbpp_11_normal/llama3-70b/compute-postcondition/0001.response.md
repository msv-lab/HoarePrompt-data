Example Answer:
`last_occ` is assigned the value of the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The value of `c` is a character, and `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1. The value of `last_occ` will be the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1**
