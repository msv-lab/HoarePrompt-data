Example Answer: 
The code returns a new string created by concatenating three parts of the original string `s`: 
1. The substring from the beginning of `s` to the character before the first occurrence of `c`.
2. The substring from the character after the first occurrence of `c` to the character before the last occurrence of `c`.
3. The substring from the character after the last occurrence of `c` to the end of `s`.

The values of `s`, `c`, `first_occ`, and `last_occ` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1**
