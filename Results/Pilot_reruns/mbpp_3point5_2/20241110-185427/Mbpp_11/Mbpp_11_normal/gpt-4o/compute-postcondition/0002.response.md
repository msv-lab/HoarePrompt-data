Example Answer:
The function returns `s` as it is. The values of `s`, `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1, `last_index` is either the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1, `last_index` is either the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1**
