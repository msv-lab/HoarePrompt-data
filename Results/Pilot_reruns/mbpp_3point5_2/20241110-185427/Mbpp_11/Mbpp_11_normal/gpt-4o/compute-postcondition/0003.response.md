Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1, `last_index` is either the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns `s`. Otherwise, the function does not modify the input variables and continues to the next part of the program.***
