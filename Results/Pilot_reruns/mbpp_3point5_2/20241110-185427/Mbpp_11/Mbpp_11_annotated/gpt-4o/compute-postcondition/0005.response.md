The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. `s` is a string and `ch` is a character. 

Case_1: If the first_index is -1, last_index is -1, or first_index is equal to last_index, then the function returns the original string `s`. 

Case_2: If the above conditions are not met, the function returns the modified string based on the given conditions, with no change in the state of the variables. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return the original string if certain conditions are met, otherwise return a modified string.
