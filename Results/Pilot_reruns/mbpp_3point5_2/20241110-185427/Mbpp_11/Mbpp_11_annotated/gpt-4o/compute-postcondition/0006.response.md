Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. If the `ch` character is not found in the string `s`, or if it is found only once at the same position, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns a modified string by removing the character `ch` and concatenating the remaining parts of the string. **
