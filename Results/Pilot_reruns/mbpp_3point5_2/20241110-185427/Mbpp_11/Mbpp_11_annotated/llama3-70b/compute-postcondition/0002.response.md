Example Answer:
The code removes the character `c` from the string `s` by slicing the string from index 0 to `first_occ`, excluding `c`, then from `first_occ + 1` to `last_occ`, excluding `c`, and finally from `last_occ + 1` to the end of the string. The value of `first_occ` and `last_occ` determines the slicing. The Output State after execution is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`**
