Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, then finds the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns a modified substring of `s` by removing the characters at those indices. If either the first or last occurrence is not found, it returns the original string `s`. **
