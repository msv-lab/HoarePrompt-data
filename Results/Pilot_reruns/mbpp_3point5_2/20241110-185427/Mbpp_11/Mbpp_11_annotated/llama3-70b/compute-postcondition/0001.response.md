Example Answer: 
`last_occ` is assigned the value of the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The value of `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. The output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`**
