Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the problem description. It takes two lists of numbers with the same length, checks if the lengths are equal, and then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of the two input lists. The program also correctly raises a ValueError if the lengths of the lists are not the same. The annotations provided also align with the code and describe the functionality of the program accurately.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, and there are no examples that indicate otherwise. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
