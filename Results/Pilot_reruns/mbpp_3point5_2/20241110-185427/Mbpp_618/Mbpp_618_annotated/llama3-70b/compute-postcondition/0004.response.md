Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two lists of numbers with the same length. It raises a ValueError if the lengths of the lists are not equal. If the lengths are equal, it returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of list1 by list2. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where one or both of the lists are empty. This could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
- There is no check for division by zero within the function, which could result in runtime errors if any element in list2 is 0. It would be beneficial to include a check for zero division to enhance the robustness of the function.
