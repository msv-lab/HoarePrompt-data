The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, the function returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers with the same length. It raises a ValueError if the lengths are not equal. Otherwise, it returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of list1 by list2.**
