Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where division by zero might occur. The problem description specifies that the code should assume that list2 elements are not zero, but the code does not have any logic to check for this. This means that if any element in list2 is zero, the code will throw a ZeroDivisionError and not provide the correct output as expected. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
