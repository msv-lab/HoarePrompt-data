Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem statement. It takes two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and performs element-wise division between the corresponding elements of the two lists. The function assumes that the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal and that `list2` does not contain any zeros. The code then returns a new list containing the results of the division operation. The output hints also align with the code's functionality and confirm that it adheres to the problem description. There are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements.
