The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers. The length of `list1` is equal to the length of `list2`, and `list2` does not contain any zeros. The function does not return any specific output, but it operates based on the constraints mentioned above. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, ensuring that they meet the specified constraints.
