The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers. It then performs element-wise division between the corresponding elements of `list1` and `list2`. The function assumes that the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal, and `list2` does not contain any zeros. The function returns a new list containing the results of the division operation.
