The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of numbers of the same length. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. Otherwise, the function returns a new list containing the result of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both lists of numbers of the same length. It returns a new list containing the result of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`, unless the lengths of the lists are not equal, in which case a ValueError is raised.**
