Example Answer:
Both lists must be of the same length. Since the lengths of list1 and list2 are preconditions, raising a ValueError with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length' indicates that the program stops execution and an error is raised.
Output State: **Error: ValueError - Both lists must be of the same length**
