Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. Otherwise, the function returns a new list containing the result of dividing each element of list1 by the corresponding element of list2.**
