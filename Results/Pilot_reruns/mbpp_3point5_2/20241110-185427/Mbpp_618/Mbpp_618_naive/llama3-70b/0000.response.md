Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and divides them element-wise. It first checks if the lengths of both input lists are the same, and if not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then it uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to iterate over both lists simultaneously and perform the division operation. Since the function explicitly checks for the length of both lists and handles the division operation for each pair of elements, it covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
