Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided function `func_1` correctly divides two lists element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The function iterates over each pair of elements from the input lists, performs the division operation, and returns a new list with the result. The assert statements provided in the problem description also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the given test cases. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not follow the problem description, so the correctness is deemed as True.
