Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array using enumerate to check if the element exists in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases also match the expected output, indicating that the program is correct for all potential cases.
