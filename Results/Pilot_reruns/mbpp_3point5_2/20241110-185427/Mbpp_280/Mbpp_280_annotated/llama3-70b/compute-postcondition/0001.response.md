Example Answer: 
The function returns True and the value of i, which is 0. The state of arr, elem, and x remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, elem is a single element, i is 0, x is the first element in arr, and the function returns True, i is 0.
Output State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, elem is a single element, i is 0, x is the first element in arr, and the function returns True, i is 0**
