Example Answer: 
The function returns False and -1 when 'elem' is not found in 'arr'. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **If the element 'elem' is found in the list 'arr', the function returns True and the index 'i' where the element is found. If 'elem' is not found in 'arr', the function does not return anything.**
