The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` of elements and a single element `elem`. The functionality of the function is as follows:

Case_1: If the element `elem` is found in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the index `i` where the element is found. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return anything.

Case_2: If the element `elem` is found in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the index `i` where the element is found. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return anything. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of elements and a single element `elem`, and if `elem` is found in `arr`, it returns True along with the index `i` where `elem` is found. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return anything.
