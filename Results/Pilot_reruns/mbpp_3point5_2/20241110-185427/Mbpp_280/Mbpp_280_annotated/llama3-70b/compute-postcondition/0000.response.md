According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, elem is a single element, so for the loop to execute, the arr list must have at least 1 element, and i should be 0 with x being the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, elem is a single element, i is 0, x is the first element in arr**
