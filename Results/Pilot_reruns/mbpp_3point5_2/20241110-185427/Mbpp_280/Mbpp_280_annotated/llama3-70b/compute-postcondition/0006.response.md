According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables arr and elem. If the second element in arr is equal to elem, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, arr is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, elem is a single element, i is 1, x is the second element in arr. So for the loop to execute one more time, the second element in arr must be equal to elem and the index i should be 2.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, elem is a single element, i is 2, x is the second element in arr**
