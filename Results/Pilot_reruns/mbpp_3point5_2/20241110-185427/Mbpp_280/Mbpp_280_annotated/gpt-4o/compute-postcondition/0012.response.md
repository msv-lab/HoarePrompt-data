The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` which is a list and `element` which can be any data type. 

Case_1: If `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False. If `arr` is empty, the function also returns False.

Case_2: Similarly, if `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False. If `arr` is empty, the function also returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element, and return True along with the index of the element in the list if the element is found. If the element is not found or the list is empty, the function returns False.
