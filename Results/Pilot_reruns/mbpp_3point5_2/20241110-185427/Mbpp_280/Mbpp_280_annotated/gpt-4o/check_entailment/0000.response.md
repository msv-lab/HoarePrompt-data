Correctness: True

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `arr` and an `element`, then iterates through the list to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found or the list is empty, it returns False. This behavior aligns with the problem description, where the function is expected to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The annotations also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns True and the index of the element in the list if found, and False if not found or if the list is empty. Since the code and annotations match the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
