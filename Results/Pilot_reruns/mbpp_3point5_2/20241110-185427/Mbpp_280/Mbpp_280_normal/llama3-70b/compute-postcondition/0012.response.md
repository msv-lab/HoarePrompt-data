The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` which is a list of elements and `elem` which can be any data type. 

After executing the function body, there are two cases:
Case 1: If `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns True and the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False and -1.
Case 2: This case is the same as Case 1, where if `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns True and the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of elements and a data type `elem`, and return True along with the index of the first occurrence of `elem` if it is found in `arr`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False along with -1.
