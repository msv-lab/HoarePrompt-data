Example Answer: 
The function returns `True` and the current value of `index`. The initial value of `index` is 0, and `value` is the first element in the list `arr`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True, 0`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True, 0`**
