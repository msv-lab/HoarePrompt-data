Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements. The variable `index` is set to 1, and `value` is assigned as the second element in the list `arr`. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns True along with the value of `index`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `arr`, `index`, and `value`.***
