The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of elements and a single element `element`. It then iterates through the list to check if the `element` is present. If the `element` is found in the list, the function returns True along with the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns False along with an index of -1.
