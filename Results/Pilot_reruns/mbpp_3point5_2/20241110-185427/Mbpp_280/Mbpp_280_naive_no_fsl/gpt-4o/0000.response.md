Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that iterates through the input array using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and value at each position. It then checks if the value is equal to the input element, and if so, returns a tuple with True and the index. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the element is present at different positions in the array, and in each case, the program correctly returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. Hence, the program is correct.
