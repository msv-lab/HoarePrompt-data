Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program takes a binary string `s` and the number of rotations `n` as inputs. It then rotates the string `s` by the given number of times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value (number of '1's) in each rotation. The program correctly handles the rotation by repeating the string `s` as needed and then calculates the count of odd values in each rotation. The logic of counting odd values by checking the count of '1's modulo 2 is also correct. Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
