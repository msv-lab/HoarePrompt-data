Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `i + len(s)`. Since `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, if `i` is within the range of a single repetition of `s`, `temp` will be a portion of `s`, otherwise, it will be a portion that crosses the repetition boundary. The value of `count` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a substring of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a substring of `s`**
