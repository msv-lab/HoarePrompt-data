According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `temp` is a substring of `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `temp` is a substring of `s`**
