Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It rotates the binary string by the specified number of iterations, counts the number of times the rotated binary string results in an odd integer value, and returns this count. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.**
