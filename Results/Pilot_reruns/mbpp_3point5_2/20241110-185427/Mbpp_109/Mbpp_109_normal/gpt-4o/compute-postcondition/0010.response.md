Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string. If the integer value is odd, `count` is increased by 1. Overall, the program maintains the initial state conditions and updates the count variable accordingly based on the oddness of the integer value.***
