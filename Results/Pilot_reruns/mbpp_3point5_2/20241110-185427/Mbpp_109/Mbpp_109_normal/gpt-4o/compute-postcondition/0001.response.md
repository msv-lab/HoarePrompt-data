According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. So, for the loop to execute, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, binary_str remains a binary string, num_rotations is greater than 0, and count remains 0.
State: **`binary_str` is a binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
