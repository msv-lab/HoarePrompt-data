The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a binary string, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function rotates the binary string `binary_str` by `num_rotations` iterations. The function keeps track of how many times the rotated binary string resulted in an odd integer value after applying the specified number of rotations and stores this count in a variable `count`. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. The function then returns the value of `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, rotate the binary string by the specified number of iterations, count the number of times the rotated binary string results in an odd integer value, and return this count.
