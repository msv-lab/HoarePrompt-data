Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string**
