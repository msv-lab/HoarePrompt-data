According to the code, the loop can execute based on the `num_rotations` variable. If `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string. If the integer value is odd, `count` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the `num_rotations` needs to be greater than the current iteration count. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string, `count` is adjusted based on the oddness of the integer value**
