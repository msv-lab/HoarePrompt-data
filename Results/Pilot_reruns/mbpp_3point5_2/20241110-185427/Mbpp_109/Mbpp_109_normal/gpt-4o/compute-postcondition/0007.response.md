Example Answer: 
The `binary_str` is rotated by moving the last character to the beginning, resulting in a new rotated string. The `num_rotations` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1**
