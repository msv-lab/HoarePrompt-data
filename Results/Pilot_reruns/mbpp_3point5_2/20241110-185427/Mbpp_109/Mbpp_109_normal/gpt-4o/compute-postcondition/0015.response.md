Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count; `integer_value` is the updated integer value. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is adjusted based on the oddness of the integer value and increased by 1. In all other cases, `count` remains unchanged.***
