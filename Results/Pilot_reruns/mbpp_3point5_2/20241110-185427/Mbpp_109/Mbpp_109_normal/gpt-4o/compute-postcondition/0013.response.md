Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is converted to an integer value using base 2 conversion. The `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count, so the `integer_value` is updated to the new integer value. The `count` is adjusted based on the oddness of the integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count; `integer_value` is the updated integer value, `count` is adjusted based on the oddness of the integer value.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count; `integer_value` is the updated integer value, `count` is adjusted based on the oddness of the integer value**
