The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It iterates through substrings of `s` with a length equal to the length of `s`, calculating the parity of the number of '1's in each substring. The function returns either 0 or 1 as the final count based on the parity. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0.
