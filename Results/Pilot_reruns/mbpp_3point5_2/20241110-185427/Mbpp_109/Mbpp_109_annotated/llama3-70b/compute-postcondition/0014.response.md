The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a binary string, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The function also returns a variable `count`, which is either 0 or 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. During the loop iterations, `i` represents the next integer value after the last iteration, and `temp` is a substring of `s`. The function ultimately returns the final value of `count` after the loop completes. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It iterates through the string based on the value of `n`, updating a count variable, and returns the final count value.**
