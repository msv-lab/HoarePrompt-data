Example Answer:
The variable `temp` is assigned a substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to the end of `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0**
