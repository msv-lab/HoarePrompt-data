Example Answer: 
A substring `temp` is created by slicing `s` starting from index `i` up to `i + len(s)`. The value of `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, and `len(s)` is the length of the binary string `s`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, `temp` is a substring of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, `temp` is a substring of `s`**
