According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2, and if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `num_rotations` should be greater than the current value by 1.
State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value by 1, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2, and if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1.**
