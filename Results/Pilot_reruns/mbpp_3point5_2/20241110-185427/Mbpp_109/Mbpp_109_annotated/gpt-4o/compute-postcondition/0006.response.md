According to the code, the loop will execute based on the `num_rotations` variable. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1 if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `num_rotations` is still greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1 if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd**
