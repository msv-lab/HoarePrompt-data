Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2, and `count` is increased by 1**
