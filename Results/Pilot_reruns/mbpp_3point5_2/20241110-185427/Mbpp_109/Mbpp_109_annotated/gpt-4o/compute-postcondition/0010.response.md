Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2. If the integer value of `binary_str` modulo 2 is equal to 1, then `count` is increased by 1. Overall, the program ensures that `count` is incremented by 1 if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after the if statement executes.***
