Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2. If the integer value of `binary_str` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1.***
