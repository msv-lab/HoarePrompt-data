Example Answer:
`integer_value` is assigned the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2. The value of `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, so the value of `integer_value` depends on the specific rotated binary string. `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2.
Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the new integer value of `binary_str`, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2**
