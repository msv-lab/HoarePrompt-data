Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists` parameter and finds the maximum length of any sublist. If the `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0. The code annotations also align with the code logic, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Since there are no cases identified where the code deviates from the problem description, the correctness is evaluated as True.
