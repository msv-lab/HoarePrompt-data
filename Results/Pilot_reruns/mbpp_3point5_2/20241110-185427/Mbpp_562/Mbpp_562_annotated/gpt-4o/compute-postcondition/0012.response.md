Output State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of any sublist is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to that length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute and `max_length` remains 0. The function returns the updated `max_length` value.**
