Example Answer:
`max_length` is assigned the value 0. Since there are no specific constraints or changes to the list_of_lists, the output state is: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains elements of any data type, max_length is 0.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains elements of any data type, max_length is 0**
