Example Answer: 
The variable `max_length` is assigned the length of the third sublist `sublist`. The `max_length` now holds the length of the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` contains at least three sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least three sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist in `list_of_lists`**
