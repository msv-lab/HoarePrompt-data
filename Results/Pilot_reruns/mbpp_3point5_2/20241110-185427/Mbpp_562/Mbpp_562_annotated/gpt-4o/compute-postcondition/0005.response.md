Example Answer: 
`max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`, which is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is now updated to the length of the second sublist. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` contains at least two sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least two sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`**
