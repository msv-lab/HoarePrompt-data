Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` contains at least three sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
