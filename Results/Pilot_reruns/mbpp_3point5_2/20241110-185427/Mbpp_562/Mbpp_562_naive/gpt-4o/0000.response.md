Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the length of the longest sublist within a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist and updates the `max_length` variable if a longer sublist is found. The function then returns the maximum length found, which matches the problem description. The test cases provided also cover a variety of sublist lengths and structures, ensuring that the function works correctly for different scenarios.
