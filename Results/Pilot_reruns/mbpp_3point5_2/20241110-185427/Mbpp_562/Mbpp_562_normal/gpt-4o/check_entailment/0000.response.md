Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. The code iterates through each sublist in the input list and compares the length of the current sublist to the maximum length seen so far. If the current sublist is longer, it updates the `max_length` variable.

The code follows the problem description as it correctly returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. The code handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning 0.

Additionally, the output hints provided align with the code and do not mention any potential cases that the code does not cover. Therefore, based on the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the correctness of the program is **True**.
