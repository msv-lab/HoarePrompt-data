According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist. If the length of the first sublist is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of the first sublist. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged at 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the length of the first sublist is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` should be updated to the length of the first sublist.
2. If the length of the first sublist is not greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` should remain unchanged at its current value.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. If the length of the first sublist is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of the first sublist. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged at its current value.**
