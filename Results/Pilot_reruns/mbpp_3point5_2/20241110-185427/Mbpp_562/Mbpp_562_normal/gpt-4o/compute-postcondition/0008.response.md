Example Answer:
The variable `max_length` is assigned the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, the length of the first sublist determines the value of `max_length`. The value of `max_length` is now equal to the length of the first sublist.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the first sublist**
