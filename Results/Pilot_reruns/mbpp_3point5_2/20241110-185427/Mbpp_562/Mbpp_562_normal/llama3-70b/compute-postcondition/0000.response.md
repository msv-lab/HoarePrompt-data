Example Answer:
The function returns the maximum length of sublists within the list of lists. It iterates through each sublist and calculates the length, then returns the maximum length found. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of the sublists, the output state will be dependent on the lengths of those sublists.
Output State: **output state**
