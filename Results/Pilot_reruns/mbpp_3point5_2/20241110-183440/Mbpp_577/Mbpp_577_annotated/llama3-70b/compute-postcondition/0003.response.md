Example Answer: 
The function returns 0, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the function returns 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the function returns 0**
