Example Answer: 
The function returns `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and the function returns the value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and the function returns the value of `n`**
