Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` only returns specific values for n less than or equal to 4. For all other cases where n is greater than 4, the function will always return 0. This does not cover all possible scenarios as mentioned in the problem description. The function should return the last digit in the factorial of the given number, which is not addressed by the code. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
