The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, if `n` is a non-negative integer, the function calculates the factorial of `n` as the product of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and then returns the last digit of the factorial. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial.**
