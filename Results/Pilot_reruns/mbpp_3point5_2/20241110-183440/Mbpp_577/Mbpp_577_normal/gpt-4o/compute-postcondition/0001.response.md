Example Answer: 
`factorial` is initialized to 1 and remains unchanged as it is not affected by any calculations. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer but its value is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, factorial is 1.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, factorial is 1**
