Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program simply returns 0 for any input number greater than 4, which is not the correct approach to find the last digit of the factorial.

For example, if we input n = 5, the correct answer should be 0 according to the program, but the correct answer is actually 0 (as 5! = 120, and the last digit is 0).

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
