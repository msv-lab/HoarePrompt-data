Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the list `lst` and the conversion of the tuple `tpl` into a list. The output state is `lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`**
