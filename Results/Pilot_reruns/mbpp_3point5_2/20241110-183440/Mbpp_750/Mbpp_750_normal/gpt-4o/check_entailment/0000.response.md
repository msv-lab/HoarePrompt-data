Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`. The code achieves this by converting the tuple `tpl` into a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it with the input list `lst`. Additionally, the provided examples also validate that the code is working correctly for the given inputs.
