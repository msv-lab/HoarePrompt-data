The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tup`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns a new list that contains the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that combines the elements of both inputs.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list containing the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`.**
