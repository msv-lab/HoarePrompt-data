Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that contains the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`. The code itself is simple and straightforward, and it directly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program does what is expected, as they describe the state of the program after the return statement, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no cases provided where the code does not work as expected, and the annotations also agree with the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is considered to be true.
