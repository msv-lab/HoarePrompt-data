Example Answer: 
The function concatenates the list `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted into a list. Since the initial state is `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple, the concatenation of the list and the tuple converted to a list results in a new list. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`**
