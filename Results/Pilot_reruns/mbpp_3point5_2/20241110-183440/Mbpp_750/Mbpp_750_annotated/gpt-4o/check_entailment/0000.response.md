Correctness: True

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then concatenates the elements of the tuple to the list using the `+` operator and `list()` function. The result is a new list that combines both `lst` and the elements of `tpl`, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not behave as expected, so the code is correct. The annotations also confirm the behavior of the code, further supporting its correctness.
