Example Answer:
The code checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns a boolean value accordingly. The values of `cost_price` and `selling_price` are integers, so the code will return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the Output State is: `cost_price` and `selling_price` are integers and the code returns True or False based on their equality.
Output State: **`cost_price` and `selling_price` are integers and the code returns True or False based on their equality**
