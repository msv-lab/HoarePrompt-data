Correctness: **True**

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters - cost_price and selling_price, and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. The code annotation also confirms that the function always returns False, regardless of the input values. This aligns with the problem description, which only requires checking for equality between cost price and selling price to determine if there is no profit and no loss. Since the code matches the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
