Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function func_1 that takes in two integer parameters cost_price and selling_price and simply returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. This functionality exactly matches the problem description which states that the function should check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which is equivalent to checking if the cost_price is equal to the selling_price. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function solely checks for equality between the cost_price and selling_price and returns the result, which aligns with the code's logic. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the problem description, and the code covers all potential cases as required.
