Example Answer:
The code calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the formula V = Ï€r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The function returns the calculated volume. The output state does not change the initial state, so the output state is: radius and height are non-negative numbers.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers**
