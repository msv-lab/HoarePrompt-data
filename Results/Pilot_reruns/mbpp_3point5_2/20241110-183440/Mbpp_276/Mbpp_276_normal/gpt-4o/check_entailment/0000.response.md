Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the provided formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height` for all test cases. The output hints also align with the code description and the function `func_1` behaves as expected, returning the correct volume values. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that the code does not handle, and the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
