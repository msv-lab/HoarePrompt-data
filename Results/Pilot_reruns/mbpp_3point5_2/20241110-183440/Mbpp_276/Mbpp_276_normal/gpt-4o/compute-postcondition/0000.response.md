Example Answer:
The volume is calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The value of `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. After execution, the volume is calculated based on the provided values of `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the Output State is: radius and height are non-negative numbers, and the volume is calculated based on the given values.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers, and the volume is calculated based on the given values**
