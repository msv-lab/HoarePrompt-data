Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the formula provided in the problem description. The function takes in two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The annotations also confirm that the program state before and after the return statement is as expected. There are no edge cases or missing functionality based on the code and annotations provided. Therefore, the code aligns with the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
