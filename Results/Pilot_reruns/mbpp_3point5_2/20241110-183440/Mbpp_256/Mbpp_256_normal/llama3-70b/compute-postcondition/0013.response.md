Output State: **If num is a non-negative integer less than 2, the loop does not execute. If num is greater than or equal to 2, after the loop execution, num is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, i is either incremented by 1 or 2. If num is divisible by i, the function returns False. If num is not divisible by any i, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
