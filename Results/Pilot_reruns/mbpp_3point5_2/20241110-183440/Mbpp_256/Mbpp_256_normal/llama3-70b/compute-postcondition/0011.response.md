According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is incremented by 2. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 again and `num` should remain the same. 
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 4**
