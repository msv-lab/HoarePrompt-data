Initial assessment:
The program seems to consist of two functions. 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a non-negative integer `n`, iterates over the range from 2 to `n`, and checks if each number is prime using Function 2 (`is_prime`). It increments a count if the number is prime and returns the total count of prime numbers.
- Function 2 (`is_prime`) takes a non-negative integer `num` and checks if it is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

The description seems clear, and the code appears to be implementing the logic as described. Let's now check if the output hints align with the code and verify if there are any missing cases.

Output hint verification:
- Function 1 (`func_1`): The function correctly calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n` (inclusive) and returns the count. It also handles the case where `n` is less than 3 by returning 0. The code seems to be in agreement with the output description.
- Function 2 (`is_prime`): The function `is_prime` follows the logic described in the output hint. It returns False if `num` is less than 2 and checks for divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`. If no divisor is found, it returns True, indicating `num` is prime. The code aligns with the output description.

Considering the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no evident missing cases, we can conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
