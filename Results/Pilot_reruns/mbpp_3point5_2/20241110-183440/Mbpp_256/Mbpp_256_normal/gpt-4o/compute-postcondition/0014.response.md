According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is valid and `n` is at least 4. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next valid value after 2, which is 3. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 3**
