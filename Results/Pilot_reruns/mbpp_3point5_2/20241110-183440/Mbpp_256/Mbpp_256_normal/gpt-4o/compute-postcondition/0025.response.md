According to the code, the loop can execute if `i`, `j`, and `n` meet certain conditions within the loop range. Specifically, `j` starts at `i * i` and increments by `i` until it reaches `n`. In this case, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 9. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be updated to `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` should be updated to True.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is True**
