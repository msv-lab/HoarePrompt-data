According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 4 since we're starting the loop from 2. Before the loop starts, the conditions `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` need to be set to `True` since we're starting the loop from 2. Additionally, `i` needs to be set to 2 as it is the starting point of the loop.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2**
