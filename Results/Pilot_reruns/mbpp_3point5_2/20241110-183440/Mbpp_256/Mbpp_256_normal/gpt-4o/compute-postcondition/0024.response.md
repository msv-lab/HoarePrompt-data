According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, and the condition `n < i * i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the values of `n`, `i`, and `j`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to increase `i` by 1 to continue the loop. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
