Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is 3. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop sets is_prime[j] to False for all j in the range of i * i to n with step i. The final state is n is greater than or equal to 9, is_prime[0] is True, is_prime[1] is True, i is 3, j is equal to n, and is_prime[j] is False.***
