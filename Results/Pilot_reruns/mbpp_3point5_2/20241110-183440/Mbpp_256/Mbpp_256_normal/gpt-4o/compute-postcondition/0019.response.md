According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration, which is `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n` and `is_prime[j]` is False**
