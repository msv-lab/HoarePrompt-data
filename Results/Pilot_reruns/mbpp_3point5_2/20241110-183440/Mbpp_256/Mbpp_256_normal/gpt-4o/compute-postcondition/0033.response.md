Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then the loop iterates over the range from i * i to n with a step of i and sets the corresponding indices in the `is_prime` list to False for multiples of i. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute.***
