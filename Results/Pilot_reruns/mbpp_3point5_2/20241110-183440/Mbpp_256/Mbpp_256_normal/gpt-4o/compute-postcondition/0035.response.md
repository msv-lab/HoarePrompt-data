Output State: **If n is less than 4, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 4, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of n. For each i, if is_prime[i] is true, the loop then iterates over the range from i * i to n with a step of i, setting is_prime[j] to False for all j that are multiples of i. After the loop executes, is_prime contains values indicating whether the corresponding index is a prime number or not.**
