According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 4, `j` is 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, so `j` needs to be adjusted. `j` should be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is False**
