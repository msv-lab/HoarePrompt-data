Example Answer:
The list `is_prime` is created with length `n` and all values set to `True`. The length of the list is determined by the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`**
