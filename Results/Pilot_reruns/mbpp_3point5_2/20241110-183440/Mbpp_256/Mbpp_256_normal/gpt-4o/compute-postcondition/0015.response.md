According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. So in this case, for the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3 which means `i * i` is 9. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True` which might be important for the loop body operations. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n`**
