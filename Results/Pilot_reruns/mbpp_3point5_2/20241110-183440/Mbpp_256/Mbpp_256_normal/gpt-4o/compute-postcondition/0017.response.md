According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` needs to be True. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is True.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is True**
