Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. The program initializes a list `is_prime` to keep track of whether a number is prime or not. It then iterates through the numbers up to the square root of the input number `n` and marks the multiples of each prime number as not prime. Finally, the program returns the sum of the `is_prime` list, which corresponds to the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program has been validated with assertions for inputs 5, 10, and 100, and in each case, the output matches the expected count of prime numbers less than the given number. Since the program handles the described logic correctly for all provided test cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
