Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function that correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It handles edge cases such as when the input number is less than 2 and correctly checks for prime numbers using the is_prime function. The program iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1 and increments the count for each prime number found. The logic is sound and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Thus, the program is correct.
