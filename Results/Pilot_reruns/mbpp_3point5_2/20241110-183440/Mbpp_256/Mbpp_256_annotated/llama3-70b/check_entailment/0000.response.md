Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_prime`. 
- The `func_1` function takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. It correctly iterates over numbers from 2 to `n-1` and increments the `count` variable for each prime number encountered by calling the `is_prime` function. The `is_prime` function accurately determines whether a given number is prime or not by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. 
- The annotations in the code provide insights into the state of the program at different stages and describe how the functions `func_1` and `is_prime` operate. The annotations align with the actual code logic and support the problem description of finding the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. 
- The code covers the scenarios where `n` is less than 3 (returning 0) and where `n` is at least 3 (calculating the count of prime numbers correctly). 
- There are no edge cases or instances identified where the code deviates from the problem description. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
