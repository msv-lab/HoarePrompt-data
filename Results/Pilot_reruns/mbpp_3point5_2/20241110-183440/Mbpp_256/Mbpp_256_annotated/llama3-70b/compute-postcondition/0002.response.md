According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, at the beginning of the loop, `i` is 2.
State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
