According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the square root of `num` (rounded up to the nearest integer). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than 3 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 since it should be less than the square root of `num`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is greater than 3 and `i` is 3**
