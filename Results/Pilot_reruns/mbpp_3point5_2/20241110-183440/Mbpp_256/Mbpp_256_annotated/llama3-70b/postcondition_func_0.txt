The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than 3, the function returns 0. If `n` is at least 3, the function iterates over numbers from 2 to n-1, incrementing the `count` variable by 1 for each prime number encountered. The final value of `count` represents the number of prime numbers between 2 and n (exclusive). However, there is a missing piece in the code where the function `is_prime(num)` is called, but its implementation is not provided in the given code. Therefore, the actual behavior of the function might differ depending on how `is_prime(num)` is defined.
