According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i * i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 4. Since `i * i` is 25 and that is less than `n`, the loop will execute one more time. The condition `is_prime[j]` being False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i` means that all values in that range have been marked as not prime during the last iteration. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`**
