According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and all other `is_prime[j]` values are False. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the `j` value must be less than `n`. Therefore, the `j` value needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False, where j is less than n**
