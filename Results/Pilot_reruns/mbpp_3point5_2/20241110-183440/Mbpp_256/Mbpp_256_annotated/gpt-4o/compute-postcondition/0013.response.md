Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then the loop iterates over the range from i * i to n with a step size of i, setting the corresponding values in the `is_prime` list to False. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute. The postcondition ensures that multiples of i starting from i * i are marked as False in the `is_prime` list.***
