According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is always False. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is always False. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased beyond its current value but still less than `n`. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be incremented by `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is less than `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is always False**
