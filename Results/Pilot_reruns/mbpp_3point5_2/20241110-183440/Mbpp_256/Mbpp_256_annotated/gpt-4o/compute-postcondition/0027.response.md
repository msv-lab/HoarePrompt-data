According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`**
