According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is within the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of `5*5` to `n` with a step of `5`. 
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`, `j` is in the range of `25` to `n` with a step of `5`**
