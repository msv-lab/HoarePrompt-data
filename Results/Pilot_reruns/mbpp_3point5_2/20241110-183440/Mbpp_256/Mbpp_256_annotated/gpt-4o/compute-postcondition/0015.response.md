According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. For the loop to execute, `i * i` must be less than `n`. As `i` is 3, `i * i` is 9 which is less than 4, so the loop will not execute. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be at least 2. 
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False**
