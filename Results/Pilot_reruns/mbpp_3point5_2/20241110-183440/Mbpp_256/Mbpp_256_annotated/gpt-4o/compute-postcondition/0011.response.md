According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is less than `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is always False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n + i + i` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is less than `n + i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is always False**
