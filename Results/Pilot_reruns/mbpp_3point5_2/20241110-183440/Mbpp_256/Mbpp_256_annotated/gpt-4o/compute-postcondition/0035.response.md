Output State: **If n is less than 4, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 4, the loop will iterate over the range from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each prime number found, the loop will mark all multiples of that number as False in the is_prime list. The final state will have n as at least 4, i as the last value before the loop ends, is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] as False, and is_prime[j] as False for all j in the range of i * i to n with a step of i.**
