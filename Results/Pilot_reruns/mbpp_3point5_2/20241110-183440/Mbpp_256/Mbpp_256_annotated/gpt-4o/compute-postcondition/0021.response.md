According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False, where j is less than n. To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the `n` value as `n` is at least 5. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1] is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False, where j is less than n**
