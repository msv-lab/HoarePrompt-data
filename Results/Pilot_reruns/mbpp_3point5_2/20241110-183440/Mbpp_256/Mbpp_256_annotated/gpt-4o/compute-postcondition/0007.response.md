According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is equal to `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is always False. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is always False**
