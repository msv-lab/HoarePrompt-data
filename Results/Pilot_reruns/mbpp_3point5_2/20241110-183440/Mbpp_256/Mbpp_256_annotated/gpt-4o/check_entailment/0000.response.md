Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the annotations provided, it is evident that the program follows the problem description for every potential case. The code initializes a list `is_prime` with True values, marks indexes 0 and 1 as False, and then iterates to mark multiples of prime numbers as False within the specified range. The function returns the sum of the resulting list `is_prime`, which represents the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`. The annotations describe how the code handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2 and cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 4. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program logic and how it aligns with the problem description. Since no potential case was identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
