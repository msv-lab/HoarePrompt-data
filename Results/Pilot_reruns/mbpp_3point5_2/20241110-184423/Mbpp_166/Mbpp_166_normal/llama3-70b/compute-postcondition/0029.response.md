According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number**
