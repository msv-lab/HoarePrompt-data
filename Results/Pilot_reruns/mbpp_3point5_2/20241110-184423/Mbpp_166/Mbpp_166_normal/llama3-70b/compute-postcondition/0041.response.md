Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of integers nums. If nums has at least 2 elements, it iterates through all pairs of elements to check if their XOR results in an even number. The function returns the count of such pairs. If nums has less than 2 elements or the XOR condition is never met, the count remains unchanged. If nums is empty, the count is 0.**
