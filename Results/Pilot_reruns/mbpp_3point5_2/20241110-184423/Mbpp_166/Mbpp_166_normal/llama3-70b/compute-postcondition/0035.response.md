According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` and `j` are equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, and `count` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums` + 1.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` and `j` are equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
