According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. 
At the end of the last iteration, if `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, and the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, then the loop will iterate again.
So for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `nums` must have at least 2 elements
- `i` should be equal to the length of `nums` minus 2
- The XOR of `nums[i]` and the current element `nums[j]` should result in an even number

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 2, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number**
