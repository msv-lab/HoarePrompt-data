According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has at least 2 elements. Since the range function in the loop starts from `i + 1`, it requires `i` to be less than the length of `nums` minus 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `count` being 0 is not relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1**
