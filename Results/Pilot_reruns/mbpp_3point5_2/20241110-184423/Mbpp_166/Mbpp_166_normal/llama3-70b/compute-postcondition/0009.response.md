Output State: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` + 1, and `count` is increased by 1 if the XOR of the elements at indices `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number. `count` is increased by 1.
