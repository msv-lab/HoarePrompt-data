According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `i + 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is equal to `i + 1` to satisfy the range condition.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` might be incremented**
