According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the list.
State: **Output State: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1**
