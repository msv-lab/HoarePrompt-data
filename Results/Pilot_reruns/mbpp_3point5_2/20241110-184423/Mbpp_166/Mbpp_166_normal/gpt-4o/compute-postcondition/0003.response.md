Example Answer:
`odd_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `odd_count` by `odd_count - 1` and then dividing by 2. The calculation is based on the previous value of `odd_count`. No other variables are affected by this calculation. 
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst, even_pairs is calculated as described, odd_pairs is calculated as described**
