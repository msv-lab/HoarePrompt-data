The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the count of even numbers in the list as `even_count`, the count of odd numbers in the list as `odd_count`, calculates the `even_pairs` based on the even numbers in the list, and calculates the `odd_pairs` based on the odd numbers in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst`, calculate the count of even and odd numbers in the list, and calculate even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the numbers in the list.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It returns the count of even numbers in the list as even_count, the count of odd numbers in the list as odd_count, and calculates even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the numbers in the list.**
