The function func_1 accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It calculates the count of even numbers in the list as even_count and the count of odd numbers in the list as odd_count. Then, it calculates even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the numbers in the list and returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. The function does not return even_count or odd_count as indicated in the annotations.
