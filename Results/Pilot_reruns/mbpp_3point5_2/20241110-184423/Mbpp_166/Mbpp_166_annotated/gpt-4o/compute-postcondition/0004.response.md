Example Answer: 
The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`, but the initial values of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list, and the function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list, and the function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`**
