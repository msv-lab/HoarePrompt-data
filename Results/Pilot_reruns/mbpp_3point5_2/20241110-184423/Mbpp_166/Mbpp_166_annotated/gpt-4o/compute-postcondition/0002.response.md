Example Answer:
The variable `even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying the `even_count` by `even_count - 1` and then dividing by 2. The value of `even_count` represents the count of even integers in the list. After calculating the expression, we get the value of `even_pairs`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list, `even_pairs` is the calculated value based on the count of even integers**
