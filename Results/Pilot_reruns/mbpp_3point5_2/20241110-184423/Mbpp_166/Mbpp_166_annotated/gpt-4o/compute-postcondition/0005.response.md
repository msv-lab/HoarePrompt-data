The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function then calculates the count of even integers in the list as `even_count`, the count of odd integers in the list as `odd_count`, and returns the sum of `even_count` and `odd_count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and return the sum of the count of even integers and the count of odd integers in the list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It calculates the count of even integers in the list as even_count, the count of odd integers as odd_count, and returns the sum of even_count and odd_count.**
