Example Answer:
The variable `even_count` is assigned the value of counting the number of even integers in the list `lst`. The value of `lst` is not provided, so the exact count of even integers cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: lst is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list**
