Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1` and within the range of `nums`, and `count` is an integer. If the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
