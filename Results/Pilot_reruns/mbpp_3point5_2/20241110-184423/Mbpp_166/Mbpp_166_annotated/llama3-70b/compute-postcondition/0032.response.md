According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums` and `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is:
State: **`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
