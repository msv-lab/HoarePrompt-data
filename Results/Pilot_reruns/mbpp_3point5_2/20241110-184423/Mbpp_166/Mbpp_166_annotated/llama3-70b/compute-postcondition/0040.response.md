The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. The function also uses variables `i` and `j`, where `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. Additionally, the function uses a variable `count`, which is an integer representing the number of even XOR results. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and calculate the number of even XOR results based on the elements of the list.
