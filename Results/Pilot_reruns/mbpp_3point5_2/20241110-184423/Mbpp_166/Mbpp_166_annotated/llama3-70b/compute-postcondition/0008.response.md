According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `count` is an integer. To execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums`. Since `j` is currently equal to `i + 2`, `i + 2` should be less than the length of `nums`. This means `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `count` is an integer**
