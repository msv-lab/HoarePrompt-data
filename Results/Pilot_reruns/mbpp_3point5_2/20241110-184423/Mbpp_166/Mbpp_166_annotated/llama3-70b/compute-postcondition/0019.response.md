Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 2` and within the range of `nums`, and `count` is an integer. If the bitwise XOR of the integers at positions `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number, then `count` is incremented by 1.***
