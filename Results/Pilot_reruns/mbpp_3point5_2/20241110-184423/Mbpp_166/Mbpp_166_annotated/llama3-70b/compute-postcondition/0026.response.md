According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state should be adjusted so that `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to `i + 1`.
State: **`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is set to `i + 1`**
