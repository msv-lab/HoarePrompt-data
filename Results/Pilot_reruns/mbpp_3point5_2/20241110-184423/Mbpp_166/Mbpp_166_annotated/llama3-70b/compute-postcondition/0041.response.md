Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. It then iterates through pairs of elements in the list and increments a counter `count` if the XOR of the pair is even. The function returns the final count of even XOR results. However, the code does not consider cases where the list `nums` has less than 2 elements, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
