Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `count` is an integer. If the result of the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
