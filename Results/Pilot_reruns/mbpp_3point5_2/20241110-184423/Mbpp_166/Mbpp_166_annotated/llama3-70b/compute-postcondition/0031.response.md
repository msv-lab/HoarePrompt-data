Postcondition: ***`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, if the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1. No changes occur if the XOR operation results in an odd number or if any of the indices `i` or `j` exceed the bounds of the `nums` array.***
