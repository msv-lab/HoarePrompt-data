According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`. This means that the loop can execute again, but we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop continues. To execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` + 1**
