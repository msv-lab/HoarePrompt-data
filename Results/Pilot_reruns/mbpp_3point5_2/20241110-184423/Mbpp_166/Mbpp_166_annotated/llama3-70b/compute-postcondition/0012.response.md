Output State: 
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1.
- `j` is equal to `i + 1`.
- `count` is an integer.
- If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number, `count` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.
