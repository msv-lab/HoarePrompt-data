According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`, so the loop will execute if the range is valid.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `count` remains an integer. Additionally, we need to update `j` to be within the range of the list `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 1` and within the range of `nums`, `count` is an integer**
