Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. The logic used in the program is incorrect. Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input list [5, 4, 7, 2, 1], the program returns 4, however, the correct answer should be 6. 

Explanation:
- The pairs that xor to an even number in this list are:
    - (5, 7)
    - (5, 1)
    - (4, 2)
    - (4, 1)
    - (7, 1)
    - (2, 1)

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
