Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if any element in the tuple is None. It then returns True if there is a None value present and False otherwise. This logic correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is correctly checking for the presence of None values in the tuple. Since there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
