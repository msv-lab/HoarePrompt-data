Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1(tup)` that iterates through the given tuple `tup` and returns True if any item in the tuple is None. If all items in the tuple are not None, the function returns False. This aligns with the problem description which states that the function should check if the given tuple has any None value or not. The code correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct. The output hints also support this by confirming that the function returns True when encountering a None value and False otherwise.
