Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the given tuple and checks if any element is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover both scenarios where the tuple has a `None` value and where it does not have any `None` value, and the function returns the expected results for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
