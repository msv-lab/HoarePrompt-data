Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `any` function to check if there is any `None` value in the given tuple. The use of a generator expression `(x is None for x in tup)` ensures that the function will return `True` if any element in the tuple is `None`, otherwise it will return `False`. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
