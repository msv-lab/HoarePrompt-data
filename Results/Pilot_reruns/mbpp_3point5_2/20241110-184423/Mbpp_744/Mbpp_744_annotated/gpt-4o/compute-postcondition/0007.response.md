Example Answer: 
The function returns True, and the initial state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, if `item` is None. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, if `item` is None.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, if `item` is None**
