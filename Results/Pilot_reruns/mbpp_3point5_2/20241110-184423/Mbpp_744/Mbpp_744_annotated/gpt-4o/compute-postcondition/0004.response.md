Example Answer: 
The function returns `True`, and the tuple `tup` has at least 2 items. `item` is defined as the second item in the tuple, so the function returns `True` without affecting the state of the variables. 
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the tuple**
