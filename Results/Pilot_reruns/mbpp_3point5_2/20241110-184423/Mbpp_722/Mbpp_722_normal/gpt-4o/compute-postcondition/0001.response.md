The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student height and student weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. The function filters the `student_dict` based on the conditions that the height of the student is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight of the student is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The filtered dictionary is then returned as the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict`, two floats `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a filtered dictionary based on the condition that the height of each student is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight of each student is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
