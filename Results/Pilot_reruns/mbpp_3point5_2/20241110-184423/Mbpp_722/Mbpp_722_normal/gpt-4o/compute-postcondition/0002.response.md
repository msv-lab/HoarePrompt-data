Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a dictionary student_dict, and two floats min_height and min_weight. It then filters the dictionary based on the condition that the height of each student is greater than or equal to min_height and the weight of each student is greater than or equal to min_weight. The filtered dictionary is returned as the output.** 

It is important to note that the code provided in the annotation is incomplete as it misses the closing bracket of the dictionary comprehension. Hence, the actual functionality might differ from what is stated in the annotation.
