Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It filters the student data based on the given minimum height and weight criteria, returning a dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of height and weight as values for students meeting the criteria. The dictionary comprehension is used to filter the student data based on the conditions provided. There is no syntax error present in the code, as mentioned in the output hints. Additionally, based on the code and the problem description, it seems to cover all potential cases and correctly filter out students based on the height and weight criteria.
