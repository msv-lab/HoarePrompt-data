Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and filters out students whose height and weight are both above the specified minimums. The code uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the students who meet the height and weight requirements. The annotations also confirm that the function returns a filtered dictionary as expected. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations do not raise any potential issues or edge cases, the correctness of the code is considered true.
