The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It filters the input dictionary `student_data` by returning a new dictionary containing only students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function ensures that students who do not meet the minimum requirements are excluded from the output.
