The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of float (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are float values representing the minimal height and minimal weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a filtered dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student information, a minimum height value, and a minimum weight value, and return a filtered dictionary containing only the students who meet the height and weight criteria. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height value, and a minimum weight value, and returns a filtered dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
