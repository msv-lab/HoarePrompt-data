Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary containing student names as keys and tuples of student height and weight as values, along with the minimum height and minimum weight. It filters out students whose height and weight are both above the specified minimum values. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, filtering out students based on the height and weight criteria. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as filtering out only one student, filtering out multiple students, and filtering out no students, and the function passes all of them correctly. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
