Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same by converting the string to a set to remove duplicates and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This logic covers all potential cases and there is no scenario where the program would fail to determine if all characters are the same. Therefore, the program is correct.
