Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set (which removes duplicates) and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This logic correctly fulfills the problem description of checking whether all characters are the same or not. Since the code checks for the presence of only one unique character in the string, it covers all potential cases and works as expected.
