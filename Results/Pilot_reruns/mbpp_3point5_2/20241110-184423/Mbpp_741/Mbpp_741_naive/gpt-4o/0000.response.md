Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all the characters in the input string `s` are the same. It returns `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise. 
The program iterates through each character in the input string starting from the second character (index 1) and compares it with the first character. If any character is found to be different from the first character, the function returns `False` immediately. If the loop completes without finding any different character, the function returns `True`.
The provided test cases also cover the scenarios where all characters are the same, all characters are different, and a mix of different characters, ensuring the correctness of the function.
