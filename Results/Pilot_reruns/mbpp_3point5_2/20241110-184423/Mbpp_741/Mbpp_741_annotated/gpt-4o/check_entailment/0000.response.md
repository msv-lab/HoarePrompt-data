Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and checks if all characters in the string are the same. If the string is empty, it returns True. If the string is not empty, it compares each character to the first character and returns False if any character is different. Otherwise, it returns True. The annotations provided also align with the problem description and accurately describe the behavior of the code. Since there are no examples or cases where the code does not work as expected, and the code and annotations agree with the problem description, the correctness is evaluated as True.
