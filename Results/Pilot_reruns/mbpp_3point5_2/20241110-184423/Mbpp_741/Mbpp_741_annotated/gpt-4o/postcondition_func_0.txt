The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. If `s` is empty, the function returns True. If `s` is a non-empty string, the function checks if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character. If all characters are equal, it returns True. If any character is not equal to the first character, it returns False.
