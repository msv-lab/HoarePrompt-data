The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, where `s` is a string. 

Case_1: If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True. 

Case_2: If `s` is a non-empty string, the function checks if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character of `s` (denoted as `first_char`). If all characters are equal to `first_char`, the loop iterates over all characters without changing the state of the variables and returns True. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the loop will return False.

Case_3: If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and the function returns True without changing the state of variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True if `s` is empty or all characters are equal to the first character. If any character is not equal to the first character, it returns False.
