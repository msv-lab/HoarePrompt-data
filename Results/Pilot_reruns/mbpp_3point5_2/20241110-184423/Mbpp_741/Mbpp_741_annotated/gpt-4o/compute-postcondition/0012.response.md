According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with more than one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character in `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `char` should be the third character in `s`. 
State: **`s` is a string with more than one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character in `s**`.
