According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the next character `char` needs to be extracted from `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `s` should contain more than one character for the loop to continue.
State: **`s` is a string with more than one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
