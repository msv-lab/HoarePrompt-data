Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The variables `s` and `char` are not modified, so the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not the last character in the string, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not the last character in the string, and the function returns False**
