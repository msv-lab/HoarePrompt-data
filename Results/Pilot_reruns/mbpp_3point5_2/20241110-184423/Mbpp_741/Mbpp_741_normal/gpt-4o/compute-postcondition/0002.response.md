Example Answer: 
The value of `first_char` is assigned the first character of string `s`. If `s` is empty, an error will be thrown because an empty string has no first character. Therefore, the program will terminate at this line and return True. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string, the function returns True**
