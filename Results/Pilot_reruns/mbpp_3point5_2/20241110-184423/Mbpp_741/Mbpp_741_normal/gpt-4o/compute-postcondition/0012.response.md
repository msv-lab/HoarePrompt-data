According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string and `char` is the next character in the string after the current `char`. To execute one more time, the `char` should not be equal to the first character of `s`, indicating that there are more characters left in the string to iterate over. Therefore, the `char` variable should be pointing to the next character in the string that has not been processed yet.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string after the current `char` that has not been processed yet**
