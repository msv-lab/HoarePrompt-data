Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` checks if the input string is empty and returns True in that case. It then iterates over each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If any character is different, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples. There are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle as expected.
