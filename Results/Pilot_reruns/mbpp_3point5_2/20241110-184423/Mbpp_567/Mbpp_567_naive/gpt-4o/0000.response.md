Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly identify if a specified list is sorted or not. The issue lies in the logic used in the function. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element. However, for a list to be sorted, all elements must be in non-decreasing order. This means that the current element can also be equal to the next element for the list to be considered sorted. 

For example, if we pass the input [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17] to the function, the program will return True incorrectly because it only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and does not consider equal elements. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for all potential cases, making the Correctness **False**.
