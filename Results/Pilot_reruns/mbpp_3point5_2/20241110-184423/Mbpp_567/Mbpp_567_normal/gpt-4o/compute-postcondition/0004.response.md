Example Answer: 
The function returns `False`, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `lst` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`lst` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the function returns False**
