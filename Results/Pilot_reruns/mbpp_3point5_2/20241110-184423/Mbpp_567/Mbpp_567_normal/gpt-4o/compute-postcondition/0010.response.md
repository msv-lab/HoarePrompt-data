Output State: **If lst has at least 2 elements, the loop checks if each element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1. If any comparison is true, the function returns False. If all comparisons are false, the function continues to execute the loop until i is len(lst) - 1. If lst has less than 2 elements or all comparisons are false, the loop does not execute and no changes occur to the state of the program variables.**
