The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be compared using the ">" operator. The function then performs the following operations:
- Case_1: If lst has at least 2 elements, the function checks if each element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1. If any comparison is true, the function returns False. If all comparisons are false, the function continues to execute the loop until i is len(lst) - 1. If lst has less than 2 elements or all comparisons are false, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur to the state of the program variables.
- Case_2: If lst has at least 2 elements and all comparisons are false, the function returns True. If lst has less than 2 elements, the function also returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of elements that can be compared using the ">" operator. It then checks for the relationship between elements in the list and returns True if all comparisons are false or if the list has less than 2 elements. If any comparison is true, the function returns False.
