According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the list `lst` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared using the ">" operator does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.
State: **`lst` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
