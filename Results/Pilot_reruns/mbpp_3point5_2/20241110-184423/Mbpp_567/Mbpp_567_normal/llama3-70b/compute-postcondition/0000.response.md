Example Answer:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list `lst` are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list to determine if they are in the correct order. If all pairs satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`, otherwise `False`. The state of `lst` remains unchanged after the function execution.
Output State: **lst is a list of elements that can be compared for sorting**
