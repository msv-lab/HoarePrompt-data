Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. The code iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If at any point the current element is greater than the next element, it returns False indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, if the loop completes without encountering such a condition, it returns True.

The code and annotations are in alignment with the problem description, and all potential cases have been covered. The annotations clarify the logic of the code and confirm that it checks for the correct condition to determine if the list is sorted. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and there are no cases identified where it fails to do so, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
