According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` starts from 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index. 
State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is the index of the second last element in the list**
