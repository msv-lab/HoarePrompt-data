The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be compared with each other. The list must have at least 2 elements.

In Case_1, if the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` for any `i` in the range of indices from 0 to len(lst) - 2, the function returns False. If no such condition is met, the function does not return anything.

In Case_2, if the list has at least 2 elements, the function does not return anything.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements `lst` and check if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` for any `i` in the specified range. If this condition is met, it returns False; otherwise, it does not return anything. The function also ensures that the list has at least 2 elements.
