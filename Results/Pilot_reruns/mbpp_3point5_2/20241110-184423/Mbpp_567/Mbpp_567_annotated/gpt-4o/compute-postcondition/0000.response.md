According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of `lst` is at least 2 because the range function will generate values from 0 to length of `lst - 2`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0**
