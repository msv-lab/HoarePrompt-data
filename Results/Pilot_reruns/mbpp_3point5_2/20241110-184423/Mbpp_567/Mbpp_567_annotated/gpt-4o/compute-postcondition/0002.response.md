Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0. If the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. The function handles all cases where the comparison between elements at index `i` and `i+1` is performed correctly, ensuring the integrity of the list.***
