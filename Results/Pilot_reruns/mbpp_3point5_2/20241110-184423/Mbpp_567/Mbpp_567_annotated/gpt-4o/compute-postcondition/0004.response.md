Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The state of `lst` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is the index of the second last element in the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is the index of the second last element in the list**
