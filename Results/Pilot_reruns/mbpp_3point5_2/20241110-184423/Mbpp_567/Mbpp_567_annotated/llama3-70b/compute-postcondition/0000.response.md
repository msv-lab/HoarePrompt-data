Example Answer:
The function returns a boolean value checking if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. The function loops through the elements of the list and compares adjacent elements to ensure they are in the correct order. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The state of the list `lst` remains unchanged.
Output State: **lst is a list of comparable elements and the function returns a boolean value indicating if all elements are in non-decreasing order**
