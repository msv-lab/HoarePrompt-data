According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, flat_list is still empty. So for the loop to be executed, the nested_list must have at least 1 element and element is the first element in the list.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list is an empty list, element is the first element in the nested_list**
