According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element is not a list, that element is appended to `flat_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains more elements.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next element is a list, `flat_list` will be extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element is not a list, that element will be appended to `flat_list`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `nested_list` and the current state of `flat_list`.

State: **`nested_list` contains more elements. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` will be extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element in `nested_list` is not a list, that element will be appended to `flat_list`.**
