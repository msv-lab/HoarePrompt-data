Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the `element` from the `nested_list`, and the return value is added to the `flat_list`. The `func_1` function modifies the `flat_list`, and the state of `flat_list` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1`, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1`, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`**
