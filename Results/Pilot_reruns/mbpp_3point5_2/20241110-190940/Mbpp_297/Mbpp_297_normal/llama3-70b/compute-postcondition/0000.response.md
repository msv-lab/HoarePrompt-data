Example Answer:
The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. This means that `flat_list` is now an empty list, and it does not affect the state of the `nested_list` variable which may still contain nested lists.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is an empty list**
