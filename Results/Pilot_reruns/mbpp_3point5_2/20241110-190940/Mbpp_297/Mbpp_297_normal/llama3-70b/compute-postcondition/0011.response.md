Example Answer: 
If the next element in `nested_list` is not a list and is denoted by `element`, then `element` will be appended to `flat_list`. After execution, `flat_list` will have `element` appended to it. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`nested_list` contains more elements; `flat_list` has `element` appended to it.**
