Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens out all elements from nested_list and returns the flattened list as flat_list. The code handles both cases where elements are lists and where they are not lists to properly flatten out the nested structure. The code aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not function as expected. The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the code is correct in its implementation.
