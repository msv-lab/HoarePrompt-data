Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list. If the first item in nested_list is a list, flat_list is extended with the result of func_1(item). If the first item in nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only the first item from nested_list. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of nested_list, including the case where nested_list is empty or contains multiple nested lists.***
