Example Answer:
`flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The `flat_list` variable is affected, while `nested_list` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists; flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists; flat_list is an empty list**
