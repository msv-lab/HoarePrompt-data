Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item. If the item is a list, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list after applying func_1 to each item. If the item is not a list, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list, considering the next item in nested_list. The overall state of the program after the if else block executes covers all edge cases of nested_list and ensures that flat_list is appropriately updated based on the conditions stated.***
