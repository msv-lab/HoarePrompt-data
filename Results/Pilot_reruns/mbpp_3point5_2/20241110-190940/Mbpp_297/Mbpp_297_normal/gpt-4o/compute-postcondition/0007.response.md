Example Answer: 
An item from nested_list is appended to flat_list. The content of item is not specified, but flat_list is modified by adding this item. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list, considering the next item in nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list, considering the next item in nested_list**
