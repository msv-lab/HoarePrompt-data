According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least one item, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the flat_list is empty. So, for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least one item and the item is the first item in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is an empty list, item is the first item in the nested_list**
