According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more items in the nested_list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item. The overall state of the program after the if else block ensures that flat_list is appropriately updated. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list should have more items.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least two items**
