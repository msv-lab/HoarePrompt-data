Example Answer:
The `element` is passed through `func_1` which modifies it and returns a list. This modified list is then appended to `flat_list`. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged, and `flat_list` is updated with the modified `element`. 
Output State: **nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first two elements, flat_list is updated with the modified elements after applying func_1 and the newly appended element**
