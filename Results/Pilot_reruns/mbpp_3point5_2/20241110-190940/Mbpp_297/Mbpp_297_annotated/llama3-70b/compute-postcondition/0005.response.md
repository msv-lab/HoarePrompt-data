According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more elements in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list is a list that contains the result of applying func_1 to all nested lists within the nested_list, and the element variable represents the first element in the nested_list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list should have more elements after the current element has been processed. This means the current element should be removed from the nested_list. The flat_list should be updated accordingly based on the removal of the current element.

State: **nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first element, flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists, element represents the new first element in the nested_list**
