Example Answer:
`func_1(element)` returns a list of elements that are then added to the `flat_list` using `extend()`. The `flat_list` is updated with the elements returned by `func_1(element)`. The `nested_list` structure remains unchanged, as only the `flat_list` is updated.
Output State: **nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first element, flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists, element represents the new first element in the nested_list**
