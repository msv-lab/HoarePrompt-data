Example Answer: 
A new element is appended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` was updated with the result of applying `func_1` to the remaining nested lists and the newly appended element. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is the original nested list structure without the first two elements, `flat_list` is the updated list after applying `func_1` to the remaining nested lists and the newly appended element.
Output State: **`nested_list` is the original nested list structure without the first two elements, `flat_list` is the updated list after applying `func_1` to the remaining nested lists and the newly appended element**
