According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If there are more elements in the `nested_list`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is the original nested list structure without the first two elements, and `flat_list` is the updated list after applying `func_1` to any nested lists encountered and appending the elements that are not lists. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `nested_list` should contain at least one more element, and the corresponding `flat_list` should be updated with the modifications and appended elements preserving the structure and order of the original nested list. 

State: **`nested_list` contains at least one more element, `flat_list` is updated with modifications and appended elements preserving the structure and order of the original nested list**
