Correctness: True

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to flatten a nested list structure. It recursively flattens any inner nested lists and appends non-list elements to the final flattened list. The annotations also confirm that the code behaves as described in the problem description. Additionally, the code handles the case where the input nested list is empty, returning an empty list as expected. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
