Example Answer:
The function returns `flat_list`, which contains a flattened version of `nested_list` after recursively applying `func_1` if there are nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `flat_list` will remain empty.
Output State: **If nested_list is not empty, flat_list will contain a flattened version of nested_list where any nested lists have been recursively flattened using func_1. If nested_list is empty, flat_list will remain empty.**
