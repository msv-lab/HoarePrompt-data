Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list with more than 1 element and there are more elements to iterate. If the new first element in nested_list is a list, flat_list is extended with the result of applying func_1 to the new first element. Otherwise, if the new first element in nested_list is not a list, flat_list appends the new first element. In both cases, flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list.***
