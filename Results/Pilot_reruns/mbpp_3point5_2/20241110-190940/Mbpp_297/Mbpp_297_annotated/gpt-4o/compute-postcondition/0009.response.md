According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more elements in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list with more than 1 element. If the first element of nested_list is a list, then flat_list is extended by applying func_1 on the first element. Otherwise, if the first element of nested_list is not a list, it is appended to flat_list. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Check if there are more elements in the nested_list to iterate over.
2. Depending on the type of the new first element in nested_list, update flat_list accordingly by either extending it with the result of func_1 applied to the first element if it's a list, or appending the first element if it's not a list.

State: **nested_list is a list with more than 1 element and there are more elements to iterate, flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list**
