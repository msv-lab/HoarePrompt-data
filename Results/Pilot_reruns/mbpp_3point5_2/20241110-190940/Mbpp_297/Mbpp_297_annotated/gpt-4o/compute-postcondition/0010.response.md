Example Answer:
func_1(item) returns a list that is then extended to flat_list. The new first element in nested_list determines the type of the list returned by func_1(item). The flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list with more than 1 element and there are more elements to iterate, flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with more than 1 element and there are more elements to iterate, flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list**
