Example Answer: 
The new item from nested_list is appended to flat_list. The first element of nested_list is added to flat_list, so flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list. The size of nested_list is reduced by one. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list with reduced elements, flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list**
