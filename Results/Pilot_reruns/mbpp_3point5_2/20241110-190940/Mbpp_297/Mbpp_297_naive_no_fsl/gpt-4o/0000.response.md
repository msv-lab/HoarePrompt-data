Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly flattens the nested list structure for all the provided test cases. The function recursively flattens the list by checking if each item is a list or not, and then extends the flat_list with the result of calling the function recursively on the nested list. The final flattened list is returned and compared with the expected output using assert statements, which pass successfully for all test cases. Hence, the program is correct.
