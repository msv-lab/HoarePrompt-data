Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly flattens the given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element in the list. It checks if the element is a list, if so, it recursively calls itself on that element. Otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. The function has been tested with multiple nested list structures and has returned the expected flattened list in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
