Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes two lists as input, finds the symmetric difference between them (elements that are present in only one of the lists), and returns the result as a sorted list. The logic seems correct and will work for all cases where the goal is to find the difference between two lists. The function first converts the lists to sets to find the symmetric difference efficiently, then converts the result back to a list and sorts it. This approach covers all potential cases and the program is correct.
