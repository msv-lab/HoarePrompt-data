Example Answer:
The `diff_elements` list contains the elements that are in `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. The `result_list` is created by converting `diff_elements` to a list. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is a list containing the elements of `diff_elements`.
Output State: **`list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is a list containing the elements of `diff_elements`**
