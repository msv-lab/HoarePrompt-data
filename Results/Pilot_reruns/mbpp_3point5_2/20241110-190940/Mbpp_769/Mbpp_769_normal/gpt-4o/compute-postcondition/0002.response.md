Example Answer: 
The variable `diff_elements` is assigned the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`. The previous values of `set1` and `set2` are lists, so the sets `set1` and `set2` are created from the lists `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`**
