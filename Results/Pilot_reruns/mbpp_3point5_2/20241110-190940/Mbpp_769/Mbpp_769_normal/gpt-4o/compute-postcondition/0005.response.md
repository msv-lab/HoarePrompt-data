Example Answer: 
The function returns `result_list`, which is a list containing the elements of `diff_elements` sorted based on the indices of elements in the concatenated lists `list1` and `list2`. The initial state provides no specific values for the lists and sets, so the exact elements cannot be determined. The output state is as follows:
Output State: **`list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`, and the function returns `result_list`**
