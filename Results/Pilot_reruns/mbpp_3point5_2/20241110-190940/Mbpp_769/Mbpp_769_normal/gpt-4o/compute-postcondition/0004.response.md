Example Answer:
The code sorts `result_list` based on the index of elements in the concatenated lists `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are lists, their elements have specific indices. Sorting based on these indices rearranges `result_list` accordingly.
Output State: **`list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is a list containing the elements of `diff_elements` sorted based on the indices of elements in the concatenated lists `list1` and `list2`**
