Example Answer:
`set1` is assigned the set of elements in `list1`. The values in `list1` determine the elements in `set1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`**
