Example Answer: 
The code first converts both lists `list1` and `list2` into sets to remove duplicate elements. Then it calculates the symmetric difference between the two sets using the `^` operator which returns elements that are present in only one of the sets. Finally, it sorts the resulting set and returns it. 
Output State: **return sorted list of elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both**
