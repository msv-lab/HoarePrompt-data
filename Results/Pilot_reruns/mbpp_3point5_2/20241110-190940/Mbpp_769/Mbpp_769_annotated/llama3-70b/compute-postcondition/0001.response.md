The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. The function returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`.
