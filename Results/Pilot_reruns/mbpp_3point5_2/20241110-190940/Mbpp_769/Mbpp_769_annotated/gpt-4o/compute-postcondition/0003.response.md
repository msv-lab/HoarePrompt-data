Example Answer: 
The `result_list` is assigned the list of elements in `diff_elements`, which are unique to either `list1` or `list2`. The `diff_elements` set is already containing these unique elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; `set1` is a set containing unique elements from `list1`; `set2` is a set containing unique elements from `list2`; `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`; `result_list` is a list containing elements unique to either `list1` or `list2.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; `set1` is a set containing unique elements from `list1`; `set2` is a set containing unique elements from `list2`; `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`; `result_list` is a list containing elements unique to either `list1` or `list2**.
