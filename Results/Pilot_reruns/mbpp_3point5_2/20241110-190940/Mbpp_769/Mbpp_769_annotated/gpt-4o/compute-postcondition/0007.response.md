Functionality: **The function func_1 takes two lists, list1 and list2, creates sets of unique elements from each list, finds elements unique to either list, sorts them based on the index of the combined lists list1 and list2, and returns the sorted list of unique elements. The function works correctly as described in the annotations, covering the basic case of sorting and returning unique elements. However, a potential edge case to consider is when list1 or list2 is empty, which is not addressed in the current implementation. In this case, the function should return an empty list as there are no unique elements to sort.**
