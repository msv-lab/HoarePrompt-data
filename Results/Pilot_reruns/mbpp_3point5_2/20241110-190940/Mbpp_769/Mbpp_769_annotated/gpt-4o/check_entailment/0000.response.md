Correctness: **False**

The code does not cover the edge case where either list1 or list2 is empty. In this case, the function should return an empty list as there are no unique elements to sort. This violates the problem description, which states that the function should return the difference between two lists. The annotations also mention this potential edge case, indicating that it should be handled in the code. Thus, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
