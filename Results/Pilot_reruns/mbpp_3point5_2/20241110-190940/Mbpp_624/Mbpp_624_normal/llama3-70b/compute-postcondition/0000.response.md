Example Answer:
The function `upper()` converts all characters in the string `s` to uppercase. Since `s` is a string, calling `upper()` on it will return a new string where all characters are uppercase. The original value of `s` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string.
Output State: **`s` is a string**
