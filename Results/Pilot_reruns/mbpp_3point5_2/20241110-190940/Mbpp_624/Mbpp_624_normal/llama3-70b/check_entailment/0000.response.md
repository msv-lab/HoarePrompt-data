Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple one-liner that uses the `upper()` method in Python to convert a given string `s` to uppercase. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string, and returns the uppercase version of that string `s`. This directly aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description that the code does not handle. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
