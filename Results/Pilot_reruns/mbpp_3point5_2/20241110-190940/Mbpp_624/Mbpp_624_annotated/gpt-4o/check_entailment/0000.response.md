Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns the uppercase version of the input string, further supporting the correctness of the code. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the problem description that the code does not handle. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the code is correct.
