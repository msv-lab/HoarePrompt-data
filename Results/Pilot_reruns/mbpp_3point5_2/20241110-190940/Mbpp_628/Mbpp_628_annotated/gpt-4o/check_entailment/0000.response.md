Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20'. The implementation of the function using the `replace` method is a valid approach to solving the problem as described in the problem statement. The code annotations also accurately describe the purpose of the function, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code does not cover. Additionally, the problem description is simple and straightforward, and the function appears to correctly address the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
