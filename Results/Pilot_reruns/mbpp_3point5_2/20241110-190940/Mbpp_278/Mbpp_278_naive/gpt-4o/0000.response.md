Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple. It iterates through the tuple elements and increments the count until it encounters a tuple element. The provided test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
