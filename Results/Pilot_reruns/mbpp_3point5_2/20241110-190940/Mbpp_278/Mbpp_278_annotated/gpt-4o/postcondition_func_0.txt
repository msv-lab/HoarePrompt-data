The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It iterates through the elements of `tup` and counts the number of elements until the first occurrence of a tuple within `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function returns 0. If `tup` does not contain any tuples, the function returns the length of `tup`. If `tup` contains a tuple as an element, the function stops counting at the index of that tuple in `tup`. The function then returns the final count value.
