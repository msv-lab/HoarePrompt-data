According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `tup` contains at least 1 element, and `elem` is set to the first element in `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `tup`**
