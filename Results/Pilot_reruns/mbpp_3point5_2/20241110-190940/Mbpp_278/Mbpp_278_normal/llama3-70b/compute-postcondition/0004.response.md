Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`. Since `elem` is the second element in `tup`, the index of `elem` would be 1. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `tup`, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `tup`, and the function returns 1**
