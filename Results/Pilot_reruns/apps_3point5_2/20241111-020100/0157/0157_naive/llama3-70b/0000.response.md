Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears to ensure that the ratio 1:2:4 is maintained. Then, it sums up the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears based on the minimum value calculated. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly implements the problem description.
