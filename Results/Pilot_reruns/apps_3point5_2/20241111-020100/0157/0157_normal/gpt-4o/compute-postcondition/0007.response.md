Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. After that, it computes the total number of fruits by multiplying the max lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
