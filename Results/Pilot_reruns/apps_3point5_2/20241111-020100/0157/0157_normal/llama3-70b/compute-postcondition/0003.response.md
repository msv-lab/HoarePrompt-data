Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is constrained between 1 and 1000, so it can be any integer within that range. The value of `b` and `c` can be any integer. Therefore, `min_lemon` will depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
