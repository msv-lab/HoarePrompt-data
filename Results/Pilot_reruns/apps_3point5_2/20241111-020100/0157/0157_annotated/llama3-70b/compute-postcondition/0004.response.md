Example Answer:
The value of `min_lemon` is initially assigned as the smallest among `a`, `b//2`, and `c//4`. The program then calculates the result by adding `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4`. Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the smallest among a, b//2, and c//4, and the result of the calculation is printed.**
