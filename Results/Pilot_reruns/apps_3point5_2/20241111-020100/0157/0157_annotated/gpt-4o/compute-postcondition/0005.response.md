Example Answer: 
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. `total_fruits` is assigned the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. The value of `total_fruits` depends on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4**
