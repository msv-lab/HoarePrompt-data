Example Answer:
The code removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' was not mentioned in the initial state, the set `digits` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the sublists of cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the sublists of cubes**
