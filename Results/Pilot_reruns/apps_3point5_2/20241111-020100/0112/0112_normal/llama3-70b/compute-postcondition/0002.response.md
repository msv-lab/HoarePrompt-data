Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input; `digits` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input; `digits` is an empty set**
