Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and then reads `n` sublists of integers. It then extracts all unique digits from these sublists, removes '0' if present, and finds the maximum number that can be formed by concatenating these digits in descending order. Finally, it outputs this maximum number. The function does not accept any parameters, although it should ideally accept the input values directly as arguments to be more versatile. Additionally, the function should consider cases where the input integers are outside the range of 1 to 3, where the sublists contain values outside the range of 0 to 9, and when handling empty sublists.**
