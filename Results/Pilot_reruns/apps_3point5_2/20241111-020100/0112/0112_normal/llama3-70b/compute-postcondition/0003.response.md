According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If cubes has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, so it ensures that there are at least 1 to 3 sublists in cubes. However, the state `digits` is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to include that the `digits` set is empty, and `cube` is the first sublist in cubes.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is an empty set, and `cube` is the first sublist in cubes**
