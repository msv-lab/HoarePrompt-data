According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more digits to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the program checks if at least one of the conditions used_cubes[i] is False and digit is in cube_faces[i] is met for any i. If this condition is satisfied, used_cubes[i] will be True, found will be True, and the loop will break. If none of these conditions are met for any i, found will remain False and used_cubes will retain their initial values. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: 
State: **Adjust used_cubes[i] and found based on the conditions met in the loop**
