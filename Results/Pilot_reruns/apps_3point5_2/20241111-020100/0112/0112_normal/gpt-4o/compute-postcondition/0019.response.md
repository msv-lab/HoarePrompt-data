According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the i-th element is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `i` is 3**
