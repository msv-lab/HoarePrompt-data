According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the i-th element is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `i` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the i-th element is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `i` is 1**
