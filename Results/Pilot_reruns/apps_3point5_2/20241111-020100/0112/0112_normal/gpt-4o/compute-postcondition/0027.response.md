According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more digit, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is initialized as `False`, `used_cubes[i]` values are not specified, `digits` has at least one more digit in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` should have at least one more digit in the list than before.
State: **`found` is initialized as `False`, `used_cubes[i]` values are not specified, `digits` has at least two more digits in the list**
