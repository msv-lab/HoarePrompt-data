Example Answer:
The positive integer `num` is converted to a string and then each character of the string is added to the list `digits`. Since `num` is a positive integer, it will have a string representation with each digit as a separate element in the list `digits`.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings**
