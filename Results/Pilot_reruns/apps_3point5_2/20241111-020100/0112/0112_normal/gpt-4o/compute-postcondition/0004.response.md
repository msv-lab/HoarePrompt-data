According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `num` being a positive integer with at least one digit does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
