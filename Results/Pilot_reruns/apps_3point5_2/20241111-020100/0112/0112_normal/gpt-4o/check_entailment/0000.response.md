Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the available cube faces. However, the function does not account for the restriction that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa using cube rotations. This means that the code does not handle all possible cases as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
