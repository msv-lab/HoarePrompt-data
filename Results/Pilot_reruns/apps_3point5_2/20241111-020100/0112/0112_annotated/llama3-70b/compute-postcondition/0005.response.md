According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cubes`. If `cubes` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `cubes` needs to have at least one more element.
State: **`cubes` has at least one more list of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings**
