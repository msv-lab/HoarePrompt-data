According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If there are more cubes in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least two lists of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings from all the cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least three lists of integers.
State: **`cubes` has at least three lists of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings from all the cubes**
