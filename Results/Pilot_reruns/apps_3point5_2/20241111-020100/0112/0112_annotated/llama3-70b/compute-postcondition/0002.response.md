The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since the input integer `n` determines the number of inner lists in `cubes`, the current state of `cubes` is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, with the number of inner lists equal to the input integer `n`; `digits` is an empty set**
