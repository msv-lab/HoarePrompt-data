Example Answer:
All the digits of each number in the list `cube` are converted to strings and added to the set `digits` using the `update` method. Since the initial state of `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings, the set is updated with additional digits obtained from the list `cube`.
Output State: **`cubes` has at least one more list of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings**
