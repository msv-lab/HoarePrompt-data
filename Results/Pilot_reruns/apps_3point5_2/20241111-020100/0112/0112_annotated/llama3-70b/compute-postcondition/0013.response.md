Example Answer:
The code sorts the unique individual digits in the set `digits` in descending order, joins them together as a string, and converts that string to an integer assigned to `max_num`. If `n` is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the set `digits` remains empty. Additionally, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed. 
Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If n is 0, the set `digits` remains empty. Additionally, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed. `max_num` is the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order.**
