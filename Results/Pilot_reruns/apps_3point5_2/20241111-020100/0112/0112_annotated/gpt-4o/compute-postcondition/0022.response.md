Postcondition: ***If `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and there is at least 1 digit in `digits`, the loop searches for the first digit in the `cube_faces` of each cube. If the digit is found in a cube face that has not been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to `True`, and `found` is set to `True`. The loop continues this process for each cube until the digit is found or all cubes have been checked. If the digit is not found in any cube, `found` remains `False`. If `num` is 0 or `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. After the if statement, the state of the program is determined by whether `found` is True or not, indicating whether the digit was found or not found in the cubes.***
