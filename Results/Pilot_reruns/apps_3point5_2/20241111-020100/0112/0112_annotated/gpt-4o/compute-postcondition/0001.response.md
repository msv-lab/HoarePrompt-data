Example Answer:
Each element in the list `used_cubes` is initialized to `False`, so after execution, `used_cubes` will be a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`**
