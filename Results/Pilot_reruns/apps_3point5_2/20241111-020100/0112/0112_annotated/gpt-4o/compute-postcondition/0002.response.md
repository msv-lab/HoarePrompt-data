According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is still a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
