According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`, `digit` is the first digit in the list, and `found` is False.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is False**
