Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes excluding '0', sorts them in descending order, and then constructs the maximum number possible using those digits. The logic of the program is sound and follows the problem description as it considers all possible combinations of digits on the cubes to form the maximum number. Additionally, the program accounts for the fact that Masha cannot make '0' as a leading digit.
