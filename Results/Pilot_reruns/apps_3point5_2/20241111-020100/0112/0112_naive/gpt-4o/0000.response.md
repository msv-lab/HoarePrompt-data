Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of cubes Masha has and the digits on each face of the cubes. It then iterates through all possible numbers starting from 1 until it can't form a number using the given cubes. The program checks if each digit of the number can be formed using the faces of the cubes by iterating through the cubes and checking if the digit is present on any face. If the number can be formed, it increments the number and continues until it can't form the next number.

The program follows the problem description correctly by checking if Masha can form all numbers from 1 to x using the given cubes. The logic of checking each digit and incrementing the number until it can't form the next number seems correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
