Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'NO'. In the case where the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are modified according to the input in both branches of the if-else statement. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, providing a comprehensive overview of the final state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
