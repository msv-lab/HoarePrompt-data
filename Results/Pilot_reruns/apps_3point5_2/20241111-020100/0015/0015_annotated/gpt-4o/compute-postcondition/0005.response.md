Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 holds true, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are altered based on the input received in both the if and else blocks, ensuring that the program output is determined by the given conditions.***
