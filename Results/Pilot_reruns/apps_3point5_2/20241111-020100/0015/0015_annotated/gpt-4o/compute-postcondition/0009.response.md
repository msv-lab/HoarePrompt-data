Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input and then performs conditional checks on these values. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` holds true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs the result of these conditional checks based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` that were read from input. The postcondition indicates that the function does not accept parameters, which contradicts the provided annotated code. The actual functionality relies on input values and conditional checks to determine the printed output.**
