The function `func` reads three integers from the input and based on the conditions: 
1. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'NO'.
2. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 
The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
