Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the cases where the difference between neighboring elements is 0 and where it is non-zero. 
- If the difference is 0 (c == 0), it correctly checks if the first element is equal to Vasya's favorite number.
- If the difference is non-zero, it correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number can be reached starting from the first element with the given difference.
