Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence (b == a), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
3. If the favorite number b can be reached by starting from a and adding multiples of c, the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, the program correctly outputs 'NO'. 

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each case.
