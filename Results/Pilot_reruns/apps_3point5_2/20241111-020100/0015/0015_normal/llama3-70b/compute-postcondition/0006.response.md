Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. This ensures that the program correctly outputs 'YES' when the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the resulting division is non-negative, and 'NO' otherwise.***
