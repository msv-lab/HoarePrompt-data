According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop may or may not have reached the end of either string, so we need to adjust `i` and `j` accordingly based on the comparison between `s[i]` and `target[j]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`**
