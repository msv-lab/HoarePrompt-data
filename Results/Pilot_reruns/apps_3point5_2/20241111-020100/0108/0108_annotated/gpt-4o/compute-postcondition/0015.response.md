According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` were adjusted based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` needs to be incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**
