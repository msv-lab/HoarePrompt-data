Output State: **If the loop executes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to the minimum of the length of `target` and the length of `s`. If the loop does not execute because either `i` is already equal to the length of `s` or `j` is already equal to the length of `target`, then `i` and `j` will remain unchanged.**
