Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. Since the initial state specifies that `res` already has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, adding `char` to `res` will result in `res` containing the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet along with the original `char` at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
