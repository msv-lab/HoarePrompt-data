Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `res` will contain the characters added in each iteration, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain an empty string. After the loop finishes, `alphabet` remains a valid list of characters.**
