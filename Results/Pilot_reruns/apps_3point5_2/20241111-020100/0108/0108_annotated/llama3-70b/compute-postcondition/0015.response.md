Example Answer:
If `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `res` will accumulate the characters in each iteration, and `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string. After the loop finishes, `alphabet` will still be a valid list of characters with at least one more character.
Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` will accumulate characters and `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, `res` will be empty. After the loop, `alphabet` will have at least one more character**
