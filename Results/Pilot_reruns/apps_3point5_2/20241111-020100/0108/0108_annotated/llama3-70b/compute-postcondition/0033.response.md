Example Answer: 
The first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet using `s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)`. The variable `res` accumulates characters with the newly replaced character. Since `alphabet` has at least one more character, the replacement can be made successfully. Therefore, the output state is: `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` has accumulated characters with the newly replaced character, `alphabet` has at least one more character.
Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` has accumulated characters with the newly replaced character, `alphabet` has at least one more character**
