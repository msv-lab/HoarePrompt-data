Example Answer: 
The loop checks if `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`. If it does, `res` will accumulate characters by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet. After the loop completes, the value of `res` will be printed. If `s` does not contain `char`, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string. After the loop finishes, `alphabet` will have characters incremented in alphabetical order. 
Output State: **`res` contains characters accumulated from replacements, `s` may have the first occurrence of `char` replaced, `alphabet` has characters incremented in alphabetical order**
