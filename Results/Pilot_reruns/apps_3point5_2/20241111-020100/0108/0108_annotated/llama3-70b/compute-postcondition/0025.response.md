According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `alphabet`. If `alphabet` still has characters left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains `char`, `res` has accumulated characters with the replaced character, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` has at least one more character. For the loop to execute one more time, `alphabet` should have at least one more character. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` will accumulate characters with the replaced character, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` will have at least one more character**
