Example Answer: 
`res` accumulates characters with the replaced character `char`, so `res` will have the original value of `char` appended to it. The value of `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement character is also present in `s. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains `char`, `res` accumulates characters with the replaced character `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement character is also present in `s.
Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` accumulates characters with the replaced character `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement character is also present in `s**
