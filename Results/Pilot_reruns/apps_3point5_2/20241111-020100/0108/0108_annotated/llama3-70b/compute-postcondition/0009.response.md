According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. This ensures that `char` is still in `s`, so no adjustments need to be made to `s`. However, since the loop can execute again, `char` must be present in `s`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
