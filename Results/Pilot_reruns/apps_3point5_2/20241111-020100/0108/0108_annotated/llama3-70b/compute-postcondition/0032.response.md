Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` variable, which accumulates characters. The `char` variable represents the next character in the alphabet after the first occurrence of the character in string `s`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` has accumulated characters with the newly replaced character, `alphabet` has at least one more character.
Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` has accumulated characters with the newly replaced character, `alphabet` has at least one more character**
