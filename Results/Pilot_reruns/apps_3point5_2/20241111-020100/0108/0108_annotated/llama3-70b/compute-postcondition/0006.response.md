According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the added character. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the character `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
