Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. It iterates through the alphabet, replacing characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet if found. If the resulting `res` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any specific output. **

Note: The annotations mention specific postconditions and states of variables, but the code does not actually return any value. It only prints the result or -1 based on a condition.
