Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through each character of the alphabet and replaces that character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. This process continues until all characters of the alphabet are present in the resulting string. If the resulting string has a length of 26 (equal to the length of the English alphabet), it prints the resulting string. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately and ensures that the resulting string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic implemented in the code covers all potential cases, ensuring that the output is correct for all possible inputs.
