Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a string input `s` and compares it to the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. If the characters match, it increments the index for both strings. If after iterating through the entire input string `s`, the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' has been matched completely, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic covers all potential cases as it ensures that the input string `s` can be transformed into a subsequence of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
