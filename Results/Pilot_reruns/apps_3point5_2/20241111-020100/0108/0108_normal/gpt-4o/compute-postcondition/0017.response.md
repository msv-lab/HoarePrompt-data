Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `target`. It does not affect the variables `s`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains all the characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` will be increased to the length of `s`, `j` will be 26. If `s` does not contain all the characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` will be increased to the length of `s`, `j` will be the number of characters in `s` that match `target`.
Output State: **If `s` contains all the characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` will be increased to the length of `s`, `j` will be 26. If `s` does not contain all the characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` will be increased to the length of `s`, `j` will be the number of characters in `s` that match `target`**
