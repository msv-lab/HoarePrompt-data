Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` variable in each iteration. The `res` variable contains the characters added in each iteration, and the `s` variable still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet. 
Output State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
