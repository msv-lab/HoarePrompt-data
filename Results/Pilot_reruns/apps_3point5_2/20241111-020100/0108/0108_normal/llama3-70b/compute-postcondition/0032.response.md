Example Answer: 
`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`. The value of `res` will keep growing with each iteration. The values of `char` and `s` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`**
