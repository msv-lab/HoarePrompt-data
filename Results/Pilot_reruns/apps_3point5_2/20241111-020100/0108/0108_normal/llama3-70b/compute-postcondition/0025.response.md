According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop will continue to execute until `char` is no longer in `s`. After the loop finishes, `res` will contain all the characters added in each iteration, and `s` will no longer contain `char`. If `char` is not in `s` initially, the loop will not execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop executed for a specific `char` in `alphabet`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `char` should still be in `s` and `s` should contain `char`.

State: **If `char` is in `s`, the loop will continue to execute until `char` is no longer in `s`. After the next iteration, `res` will contain all the characters added in each iteration, and `s` will no longer contain `char`.**
