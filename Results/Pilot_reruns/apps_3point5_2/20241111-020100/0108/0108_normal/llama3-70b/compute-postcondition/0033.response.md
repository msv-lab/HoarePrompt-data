Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The replacement occurs only once. The value of `char` might change after replacement, and the loop continues until `char` is no longer in `s` while `s` still contains the original `char`. 
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains the original `char`**
