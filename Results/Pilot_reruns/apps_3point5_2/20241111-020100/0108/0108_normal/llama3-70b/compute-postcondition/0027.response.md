Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The modified `s` is stored back in `s`. This process continues until `char` is no longer in `s`. Therefore, `char` is added to `res` until it is no longer in `s`, and `s` no longer contains `char`.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` until it is no longer in `s`, and `s` no longer contains `char**`.
