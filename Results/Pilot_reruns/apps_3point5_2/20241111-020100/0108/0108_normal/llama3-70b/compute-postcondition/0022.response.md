Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character that is one step ahead in the alphabet based on its ASCII value. The replacement is done only once. The updated string `s` now contains the new character. The characters added in this iteration are stored in variable `res`. The Output State is: `res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet.
Output State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
