Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that is one position higher in the ASCII table. The replacement is done only once. The value of `char` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`**
