According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `char` is in `s`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` should still be in `s` at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`**
