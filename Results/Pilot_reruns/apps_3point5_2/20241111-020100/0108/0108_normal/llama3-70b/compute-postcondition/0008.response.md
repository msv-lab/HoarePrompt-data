Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The variable `char` is already in the new `s`, and the alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Therefore, the character in `s` is replaced with the next character in alphabetical order. The resulting string is stored in `s`. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
