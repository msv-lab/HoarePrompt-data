According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the characters added in each iteration, and `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the state should remain the same.
State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
