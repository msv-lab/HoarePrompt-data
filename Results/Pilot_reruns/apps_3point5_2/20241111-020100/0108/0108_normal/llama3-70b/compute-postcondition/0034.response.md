According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains the original `char`. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains the original `char`**
