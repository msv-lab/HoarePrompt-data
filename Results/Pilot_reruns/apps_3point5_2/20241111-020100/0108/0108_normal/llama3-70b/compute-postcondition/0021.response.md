Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are not provided, but since `s` still contains at least one character in the alphabet, `res` will have the characters added in each iteration. 
Output State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
