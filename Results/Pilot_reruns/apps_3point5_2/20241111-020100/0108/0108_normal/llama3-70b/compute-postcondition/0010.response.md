Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, so `res` will have the new character added at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
