Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the `res` variable, which contains the characters added in each iteration. The loop has executed at least once, so `res` already contains some characters. The variable `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet. 
Output State: **If the loop has executed at least once, `res` contains the characters added in each iteration, and `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
