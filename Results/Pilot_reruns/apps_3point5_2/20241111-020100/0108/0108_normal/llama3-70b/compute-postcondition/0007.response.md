Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, which is in the new value of `s`. Therefore, after execution, `res` will have the added character. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
