Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and iterates through each letter of the alphabet.
- For each letter found in `s`, it appends that letter to the result string `res` and replaces it in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet.
- If the length of `res` reaches 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1.
- The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the scenario where the input string `s` can be transformed into a subsequence of the English alphabet by iteratively replacing characters with the next alphabetical character until the subsequence is formed. The output is correctly determined based on the length of the resulting string `res`.
