The function `func` reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and iterates through each letter of the alphabet. For each letter found in `s`, it appends that letter to the result string `res` and replaces it in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If the length of `res` reaches 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not contain any alphabet characters, it prints -1 without going through the loop.
