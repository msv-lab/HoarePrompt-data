Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string `s` and defines the target string `target` as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It then iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the characters match. If all characters in the target string are found in the input string in order, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description by checking if the input string can be transformed into the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' by replacing characters with the next character in alphabetical order. The program covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the target string or -1 if it is not possible to transform the input string into the target string.
