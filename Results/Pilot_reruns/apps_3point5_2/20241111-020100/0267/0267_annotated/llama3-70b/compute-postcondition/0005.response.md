Example Answer:
The key (n, k) in the dictionary dp is assigned the value 9. The function does not return anything, and there are no changes to the state of the program variables.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, then the function returns the value stored in dp for that key.**
