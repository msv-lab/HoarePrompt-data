According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 2, and `dp[n, k]` is updated after the calculation. Since `i` starts at 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the updated `k` value. Therefore, the `k` value needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 3, and `dp[n, k]` is updated after the calculation**
