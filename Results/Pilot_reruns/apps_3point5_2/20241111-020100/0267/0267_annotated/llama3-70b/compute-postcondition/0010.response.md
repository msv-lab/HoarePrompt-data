According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated after the calculation**
