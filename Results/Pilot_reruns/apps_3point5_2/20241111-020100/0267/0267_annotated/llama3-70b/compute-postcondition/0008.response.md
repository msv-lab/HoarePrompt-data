According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the current value of `k` and `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the given formula**
