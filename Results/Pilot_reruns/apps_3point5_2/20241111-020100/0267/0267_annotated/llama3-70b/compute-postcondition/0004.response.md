Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, then the function returns the value stored in dp for that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
