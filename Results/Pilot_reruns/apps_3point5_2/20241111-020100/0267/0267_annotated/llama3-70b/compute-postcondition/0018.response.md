The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer; `k`, which is a positive integer; and `dp`, which is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. 

Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, then the function returns the value stored in `dp` for that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.

Case 3: If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in `dp`, the function returns the value stored for that key. If `n` is less than 10, the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` storing previously calculated values. The function then returns different values based on the conditions specified in the cases mentioned above.
