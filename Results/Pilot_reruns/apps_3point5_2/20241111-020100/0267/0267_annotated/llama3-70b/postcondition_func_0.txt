The function `func_1` accepts three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, satisfying the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It uses an empty dictionary `dp` and computes the result of `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD`, where `count` is a helper function that is not explicitly defined in the provided information. The function returns this calculated result. The missing functionality in the summary is the actual implementation details of the `count` function, which impacts the final result of the main function.
