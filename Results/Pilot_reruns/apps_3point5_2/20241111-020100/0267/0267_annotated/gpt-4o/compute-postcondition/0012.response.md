Output State: **`total_sum` is an integer, initialized to 0. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a given `num`, then `total_sum` is updated to the sum of `total_sum` and `num` after applying the modulo operation with MOD. If the loop does not execute due to `l` being greater than `r`, or if `func_1(num, k)` is always false for all `num` in the range, then `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns the final value of `total_sum`.**
