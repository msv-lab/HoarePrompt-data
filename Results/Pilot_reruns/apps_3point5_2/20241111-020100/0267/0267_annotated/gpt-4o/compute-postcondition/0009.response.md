Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer initialized to 0. If the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`. There are no changes to the initial conditions if the condition is false.***
