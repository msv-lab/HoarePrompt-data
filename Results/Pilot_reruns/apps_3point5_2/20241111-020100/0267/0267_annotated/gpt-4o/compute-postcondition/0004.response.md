According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after the current `num`, and it should still be less than or equal to `r`. 
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
