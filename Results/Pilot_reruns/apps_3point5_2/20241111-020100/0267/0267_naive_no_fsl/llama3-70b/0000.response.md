Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The function uses a helper function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits. The logic in the `count` function seems correct as it handles different cases based on the value of `n` and `k`.

The main function then calculates the sum by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r`, and then takes the modulo to satisfy the problem requirements.

The input is correctly read, and the output is printed after calling the `func_1` function. Since the logic in the code seems to align with the problem description and the provided examples, the correctness is determined to be True.
