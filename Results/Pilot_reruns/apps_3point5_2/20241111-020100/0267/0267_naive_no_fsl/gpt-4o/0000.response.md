Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines the modulo value as 998244353.
2. The function func_1(n, k) checks if the number n has at most k different digits by converting it to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to k.
3. The function func_2(l, r, k) iterates over the range from l to r (inclusive) and adds the number to the total_sum only if it satisfies the condition mentioned in func_1.
4. The program calculates and prints the correct sum of numbers from l to r that have at most k different digits.
5. The program handles the input within the given constraints.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the given inputs.
