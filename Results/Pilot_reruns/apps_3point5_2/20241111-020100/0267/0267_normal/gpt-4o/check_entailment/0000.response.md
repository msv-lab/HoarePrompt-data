Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It defines two functions - `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k. This function correctly determines if a number contains at most k different digits.

`func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits. It iterates through the range from l to r inclusive and for each number, it checks if it satisfies the condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, it updates the total sum by adding the number and taking the result modulo MOD. The function then returns the final value of total sum. 

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic provided in the functions correctly calculates the sum of numbers meeting the criteria specified in the problem description for all possible inputs. Hence, the code is correct.
