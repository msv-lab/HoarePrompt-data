According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, the loop can execute. 
Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is a valid starting point and `r` is a valid ending point for the range, and `num` is equal to `l` at the start of the loop.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is a valid starting point, `r` is a valid ending point, `num` is equal to `l`**
