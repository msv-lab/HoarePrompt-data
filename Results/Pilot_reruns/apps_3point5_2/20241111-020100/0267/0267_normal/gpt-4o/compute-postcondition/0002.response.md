Example Answer: 
`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. Since `num` is initially equal to `l`, after execution, `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. The states of `l`, `r`, and `num` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `l` is a valid starting point, `r` is a valid ending point, `num` is equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `l` is a valid starting point, `r` is a valid ending point, `num` is equal to `l`**
