According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1, and `l` and `r` maintain their initial values. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged and `num` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions for the loop to continue. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`total_sum`, `num` is incremented by 1, `l` and `r` maintain their initial values**
