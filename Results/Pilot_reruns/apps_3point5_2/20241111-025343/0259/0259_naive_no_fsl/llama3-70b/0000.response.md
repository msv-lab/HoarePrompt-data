Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the arrival time for each bus route based on Serval's arrival time, and then determines the bus route that Serval will use by finding the minimum time difference between the arrival time of the bus route and Serval's arrival time. The program then outputs the bus route number accordingly. The logic is correct and handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
