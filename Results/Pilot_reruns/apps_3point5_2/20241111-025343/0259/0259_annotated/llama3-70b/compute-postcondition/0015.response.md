According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, and `min_time` is still positive infinity. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the first tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity**
