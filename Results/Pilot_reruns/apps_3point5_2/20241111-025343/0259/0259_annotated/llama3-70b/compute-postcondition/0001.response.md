Example Answer:
The list `buses` is initialized as an empty list. Since the values of `n` and `t` are not used in this code snippet, they remain as positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is an empty list**
