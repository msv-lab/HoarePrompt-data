Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The values entered by the user are stored in `s` and `d`, which are integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are the integers input by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are the integers input by the user**
