According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more tuples in the `buses` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is equivalent to the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `buses` list must have at least 2 tuples. Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the second tuple in the list, `min_time` is equivalent to the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to `i + 1**.
