Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples with at least one tuple, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum time found. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
