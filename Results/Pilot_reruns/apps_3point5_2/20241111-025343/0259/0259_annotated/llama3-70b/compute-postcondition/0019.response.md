Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is equivalent to the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to `i + 1`. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the calculated time and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
