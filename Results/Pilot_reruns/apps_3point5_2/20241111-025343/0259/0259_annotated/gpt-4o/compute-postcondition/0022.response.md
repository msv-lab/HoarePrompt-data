According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the states were as follows:
- `n` and `t` are positive integers
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples
- `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value
- `chosen_route` is the recalculated index
- `i` is 1
- `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 1
- `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the loop
- If the condition for updating `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` is met, then those values need to be updated accordingly based on the new iteration.

State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 2, and `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 2**
