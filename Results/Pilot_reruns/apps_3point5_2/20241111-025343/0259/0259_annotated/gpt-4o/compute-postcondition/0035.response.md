The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. Preconditions for the parameters are provided: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively.

After executing the function, if `n` is at least 1 and `bus_routes` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute to find the minimum wait time. The output will be `min_wait_time`, which contains the minimum wait time, and `chosen_route`, which is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

If `n` is less than 1 or `bus_routes` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and the output will be `min_wait_time` as positive infinity and `chosen_route` as -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the minimum wait time and the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time based on the input parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, handling cases where the input values do not meet the preconditions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes. It determines the minimum wait time and the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If n is at least 1 and bus_routes is non-empty, it calculates the minimum wait time and chosen route index. If n is less than 1 or bus_routes is empty, it returns minimum wait time as positive infinity and chosen route as -1.**
