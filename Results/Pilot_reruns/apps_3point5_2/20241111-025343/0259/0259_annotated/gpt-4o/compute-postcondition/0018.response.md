Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and the newly calculated `wait_time`. `chosen_route` is the recalculated index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 1 in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 1 in `bus_routes`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is the difference between `s_i` and `t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This covers all possible scenarios when executing the if else block.***
