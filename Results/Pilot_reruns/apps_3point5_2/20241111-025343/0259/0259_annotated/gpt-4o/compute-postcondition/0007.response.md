Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the current bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the current bus route. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. If not, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.*** This covers all possible cases and edge scenarios where the wait time is either 0 or calculated based on the given formula.
