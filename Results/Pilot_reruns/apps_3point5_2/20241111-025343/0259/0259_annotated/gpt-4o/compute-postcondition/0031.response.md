Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 2, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 2, `chosen_route` is 3. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases regarding the calculation of `wait_time` based on the given conditions.***
