Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
- The `func_1` function correctly calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the input time and the schedule of the bus route.
- It then selects the bus route with the minimum waiting time and returns the index of that bus route.
- The program prints the chosen bus route as the output.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines which bus route Serval will choose based on the provided input.
