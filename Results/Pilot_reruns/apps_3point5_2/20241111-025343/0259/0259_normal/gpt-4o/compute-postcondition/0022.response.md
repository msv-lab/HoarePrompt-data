According to the code and the provided postcondition, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted based on the end of the previous iteration:
1. `min_wait_time` should be updated to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the existing `min_wait_time`.
2. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` should be updated to `wait_time`.
3. `chosen_route` should be updated to `i + 1` when `min_wait_time` is updated.

State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers and a list of tuples respectively**.
