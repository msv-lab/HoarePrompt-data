Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is the difference between `d_i` and `(t - s_i) % d_i`, which is a positive integer. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. This logic covers all possible scenarios and ensures that the program variables are updated correctly based on the conditions specified.***
