Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers and a list of tuples respectively. After the execution of the if-else block, `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions: if `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The postcondition encompasses all scenarios where the wait time can be directly calculated or derived from the given conditions, ensuring the state of the program variables is accurately captured after the if-else block.***
