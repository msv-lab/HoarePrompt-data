Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers, a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is the difference between `d_i` and `(t - s_i) % d_i`, which is a positive integer.***
