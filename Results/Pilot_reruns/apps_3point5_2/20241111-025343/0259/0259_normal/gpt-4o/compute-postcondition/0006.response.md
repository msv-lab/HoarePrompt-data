Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i and d_i are assigned from the first tuple in bus_routes, wait_time is calculated based on the formula wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i**
