Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes to determine the minimum wait time and the chosen route based on the provided input values. The loop efficiently handles scenarios where the time Serval goes to the station is before or after the first bus arrival time, adjusting the wait time accordingly. The function returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. Overall, the function effectively calculates the optimal route choice based on the bus routes and input parameters.**
