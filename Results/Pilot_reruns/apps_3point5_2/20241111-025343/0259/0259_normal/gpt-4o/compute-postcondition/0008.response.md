Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in bus_routes. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the wait_time calculation based on the given conditions and initial variable values, ensuring the correct calculation of wait_time under different conditions and edge cases.***
