Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers and a list of tuples respectively. After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is set to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the existing `min_wait_time`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1` when `min_wait_time` is updated. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions: if `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and correctly captures the state of the program variables after the if-else block execution.***
