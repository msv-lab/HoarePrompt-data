According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` is an empty list**
