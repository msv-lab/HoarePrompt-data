Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`**
