Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values after mapping integers from input split. The values of `s` and `d` are based on the user input, and the variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`**
