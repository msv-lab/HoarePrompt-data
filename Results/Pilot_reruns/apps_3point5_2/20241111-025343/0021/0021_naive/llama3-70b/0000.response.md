Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the list. Then it calculates the maximum and minimum possible distances by considering the positions of 1 and n and the total number of elements in the list. Finally, it prints the maximum of the two distances, which will be the maximum distance achievable by performing one swap. 

The logic in the program is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program works correctly for all given examples and should work for any input that follows the problem description.
