Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn` (either abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 or n - 2), `min_dist` is the minimum distance between `pos1` and `posn` (either abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 or n - 2)**
