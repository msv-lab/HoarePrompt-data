The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the maximum absolute distance between the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list. The function prints this maximum distance. The function operates under the constraints that the input list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The function does not have any specific return value specified in the given information.
