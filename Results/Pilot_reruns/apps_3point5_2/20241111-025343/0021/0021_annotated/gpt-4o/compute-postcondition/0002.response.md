Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is not affected. The possible values of `min_pos` range from 0 to the length of list `a` - 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in list `a`**
