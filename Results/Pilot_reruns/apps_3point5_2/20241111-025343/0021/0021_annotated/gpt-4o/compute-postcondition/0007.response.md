Example Answer: 
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - min_pos`. The values of `n`, `min_pos`, and `a` are given in the initial state. After executing the code, the value of `dist4` will be updated based on the given values of `n` and `min_pos`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - min_pos`.**
