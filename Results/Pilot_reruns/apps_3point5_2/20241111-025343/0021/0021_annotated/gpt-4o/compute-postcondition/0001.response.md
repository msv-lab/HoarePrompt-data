Example Answer:
The input is split and converted into a list of integers stored in variable `a`. The previous value of `n` is unknown and not impacted by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers**
