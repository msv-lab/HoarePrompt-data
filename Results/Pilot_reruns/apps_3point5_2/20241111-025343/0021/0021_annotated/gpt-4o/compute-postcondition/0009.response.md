Example Answer:
`max_distance` is printed, which is the maximum among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are calculated based on the initial state values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - min_pos`, and the function prints the maximum among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - min_pos`, and the function prints the maximum among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4**`
