Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, the value of `dist2` will be the absolute difference between `n-1` and `n-1`, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0**
