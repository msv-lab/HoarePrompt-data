Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a` which is stored in `min_pos`. Since `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `dist3` will be the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a`**
