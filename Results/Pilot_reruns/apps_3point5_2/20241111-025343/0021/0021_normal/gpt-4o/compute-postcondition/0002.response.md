Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since it is given that all integers in list `a` are distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`, and that 1 is present in the list, `min_pos` will be the position of 1 in the list `a`. Therefore, `min_pos` will hold the index of 1 in the list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`**
