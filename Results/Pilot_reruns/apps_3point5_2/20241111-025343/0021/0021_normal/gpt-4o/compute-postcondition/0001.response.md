Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`**
