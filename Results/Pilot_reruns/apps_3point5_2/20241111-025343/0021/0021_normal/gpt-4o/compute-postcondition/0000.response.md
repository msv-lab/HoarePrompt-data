Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the range of `n` is defined as 2 <= n <= 100, the value of `n` after input will be within this range. The list `a` is not initialized or affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. `a` is a list of n distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to n.**
