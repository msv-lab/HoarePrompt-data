Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the element 1 in list `a`. As 1 is present in the list `a` and it is guaranteed to be distinct, the index of 1 will be found in `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`**
