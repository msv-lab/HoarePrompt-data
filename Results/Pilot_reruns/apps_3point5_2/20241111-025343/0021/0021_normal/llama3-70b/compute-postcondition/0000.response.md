Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is constrained by the precondition, so it is an integer between 2 and 100. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
