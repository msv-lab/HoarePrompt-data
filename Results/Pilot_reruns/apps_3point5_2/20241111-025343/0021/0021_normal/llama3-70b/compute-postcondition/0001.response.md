Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. Since the input contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
