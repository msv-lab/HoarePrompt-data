Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The value of `pos1` and `posn` are the indices of elements 1 and n in list `a` respectively. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum value calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum value calculated based on the given formula**
