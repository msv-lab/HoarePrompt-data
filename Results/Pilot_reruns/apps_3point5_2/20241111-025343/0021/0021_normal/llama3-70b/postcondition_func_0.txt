The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the index of element 1 and the index of element `n`, subtracting 1, and the minimum distance between these indices, subtracting 1. Finally, the function prints the maximum value between the calculated maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`.
