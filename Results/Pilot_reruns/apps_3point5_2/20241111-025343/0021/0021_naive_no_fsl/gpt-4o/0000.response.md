Correctness: False

The given program does not always produce the correct output for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the minimum element and the maximum element are already at the opposite ends of the array, and swapping them would not increase the distance between them. The program does not handle this case correctly and may output an incorrect maximum distance.
