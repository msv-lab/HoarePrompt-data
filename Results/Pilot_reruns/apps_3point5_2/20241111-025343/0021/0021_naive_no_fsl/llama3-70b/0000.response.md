Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum possible distance by considering two scenarios: swapping the elements and not swapping them. The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.
