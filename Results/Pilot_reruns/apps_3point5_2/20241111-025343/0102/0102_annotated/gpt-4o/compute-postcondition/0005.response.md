Example Answer:
The code snippet returns the value at the index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n // 10` will give the tens digit of `n`. So, the code snippet will return the value at the tens digit index in the `tens` list. The initial state variables are not changed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99**
