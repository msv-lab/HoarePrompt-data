Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the value corresponding to the teens array at index (n - 10). If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the value at the tens place of `n` from the tens array. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the combination of the tens place value followed by a hyphen and the ones place value of `n`. For all other cases where 0 ≤ n < 10 or n is not an integer, the program does not return anything.***
