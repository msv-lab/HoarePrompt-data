You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    ones = ['', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight',
    'nine']
    #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99.
    teens = ['ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99
    tens = ['', '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
    s = int(input())
    #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
    if (s < 10) :
        print(ones[s])
        #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
    else :
        if (s < 20) :
            print(teens[s - 10])
            #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers, and the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed
        #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers, and the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed
        else :
            print(tens[s // 10] + ('' if s % 10 == 0 else '-' + ones[s % 10]))
            #State of the program here: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
        #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers. If s < 20, the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed. Otherwise, the string at index `s // 10` in the `tens` list concatenated with '-' and the string at index `s % 10` in the `ones` list is printed, unless s % 10 is 0, then only the `tens` string is printed.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers. If s < 20, the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed. Otherwise, the string at index `s // 10` in the `tens` list concatenated with '-' and the string at index `s % 10` in the `ones` list is printed, unless s % 10 is 0, then only the `tens` string is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers. If s < 10, the string at index `s` in the `ones` list is printed. If s is between 10 and 19, the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed. If s is 20 or greater, the string at index `s // 10` in the `tens` list concatenated with '-' and the string at index `s % 10` in the `ones` list is printed, unless s % 10 is 0, then only the `tens` string is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `s` between 0 and 99. It then prints out the English representation of the number based on the value of `s`. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the string representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the string representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the combination of the string representation of the tens place and ones place from the `tens` and `ones` lists respectively, with a hyphen in between if the ones place is not zero.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
