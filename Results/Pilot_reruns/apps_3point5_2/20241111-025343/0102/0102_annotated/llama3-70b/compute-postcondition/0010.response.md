Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `s` between 0 and 99. It then prints out the English representation of the number based on the value of `s`. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the string representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the string representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the combination of the string representation of the tens place and ones place from the `tens` and `ones` lists respectively, with a hyphen in between if the ones place is not zero.**
