Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers. If s < 20, the string at index `s-10` in the `teens` list is printed. Otherwise, the string at index `s // 10` in the `tens` list concatenated with '-' and the string at index `s % 10` in the `ones` list is printed, unless s % 10 is 0, then only the `tens` string is printed.***
