Example Answer:
The code accesses the `ones` list at index `s` and prints the value at that index. The value of `s` is between 0 and 99, so the code will print the value stored at that index in the `ones` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `s` is an input integer**
