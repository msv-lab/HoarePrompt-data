Example Answer:
The code prints the element at index `s - 10` in the list `teens`. Since `s` is an integer input and can range from 0 to 99, the index `s - 10` will be within the range of the `teens` list elements. Therefore, the output state is: 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `s` is an input integer.
Output State: **0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `s` is an input integer**
