Postcondition: ***0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `s` is an input integer. If s < 20, the program prints the value stored in the `teens` list at index s-10. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the concatenation of the value at index s//10 in the `tens` list and the value at index s%10 in the `ones` list. If s is a multiple of 10, there is no hyphen added between the `tens` and `ones` values.***
