Example Answer:
The function returns the element in the list `teens` at index `n - 10`. Since `n` is an integer between 10 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the string representing the number in the teens range.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the string representing the number in the teens range**
