Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representing the number in the ones range from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representing the number in the teens range from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list if `n` is a multiple of 10. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen. The program handles all edge cases for the given range of `n` and correctly provides the respective string representation based on the conditions.***
