Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` between 0 and 99 as input. It then returns the string representation of the number based on the following conditions:
- If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representing the number in the ones range from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representing the number in the teens range from the `teens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99, and is a multiple of 10, it returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99, and is not a multiple of 10, it returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen.
The program handles all edge cases within the specified range of `n` and correctly provides the respective string representation based on the conditions.**
