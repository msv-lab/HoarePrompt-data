Example Answer:
The variable `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing tens places in numbers. The previous values of `n`, `ones`, and `teens` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers**
