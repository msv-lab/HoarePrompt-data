Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the string at index n // 10 in the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. The values of `n`, `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the concatenation of the tens place and ones place strings.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the concatenation of the tens place and ones place strings**
