Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input N, K, and the list of integers A.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A.
- Then, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of gcd.
- Finally, it prints the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

The code follows the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming its correctness.
