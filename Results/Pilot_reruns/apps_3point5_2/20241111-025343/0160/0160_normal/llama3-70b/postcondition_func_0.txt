The function `func` reads two integers N and K from input, followed by a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of gcd, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
