According to the code, the loop can execute if N is 2 or greater. If N is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and gcd will remain the initial value assigned. Since the loop goes up to the square root of gcd, the loop will execute if gcd is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, and i is 1.
State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1**
