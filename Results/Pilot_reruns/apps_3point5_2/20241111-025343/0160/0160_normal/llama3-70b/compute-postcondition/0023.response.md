Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`, which is 3. So, after execution, `max_divisor` is updated to 3. The values of `N` and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 3, max_divisor is 3.
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 3, max_divisor is 3**
