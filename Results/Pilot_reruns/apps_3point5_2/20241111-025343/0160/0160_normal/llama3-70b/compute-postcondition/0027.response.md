According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is 2 or greater, `gcd` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `i` is 3. The condition `gcd` is divisible by `i` does not guarantee the loop will execute again, so no change is needed for `N`, `gcd`, `i`. However, since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 4**
