Example Answer:
`N` and `K` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts multiple inputs separated by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts those inputs to integers, and then assigns them to `N` and `K`. The values of `N` and `K` are constrained by the input limits, so they will be within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
