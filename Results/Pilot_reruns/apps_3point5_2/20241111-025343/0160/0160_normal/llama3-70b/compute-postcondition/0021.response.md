Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2. If gcd is divisible by i, max_divisor is updated to be the maximum value between its previous value and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to be the maximum value between its previous value and gcd divided by i. Otherwise, no changes are made to max_divisor.***
