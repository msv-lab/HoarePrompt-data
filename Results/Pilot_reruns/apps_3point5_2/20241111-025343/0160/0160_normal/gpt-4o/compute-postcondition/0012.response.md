Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number greater than 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` also contains `i` and `x // i`. In all cases, including edge cases and boundary values, after the execution of the if statement, `divisors` is updated accordingly based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`.***
