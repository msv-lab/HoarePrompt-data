According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from 1 to the square root of x has at least one element. The loop will not execute if the square root of x is less than 1. Before the loop starts, `divisors` being an empty set does not ensure the loop execution, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is a positive number and `i` is 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
