According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `x` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number greater than 1**
