Example Answer: 
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` initially contains 1, `x`, and `i`, the value of `x // i` is added to the set. The output state is: `divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, `i`, and `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, `i`, and `x // i`**
