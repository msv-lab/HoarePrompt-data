According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `divisors` is the set of divisors of `x`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `divisors` is the set of divisors of `x`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 2**
