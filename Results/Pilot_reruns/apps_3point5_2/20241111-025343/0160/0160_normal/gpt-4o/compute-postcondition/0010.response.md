Example Answer:
`i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` initially contains 1 and `x`, so after adding `i`, the set `divisors` will contain 1, `x`, and `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, and `i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, and `i`**
