Example Answer: 
The value of `x` divided by `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which initially contains 1. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` will be equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` is added to the set `divisors`. The value of `x` is a positive number, so the output state is: `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, `i` is 1**
