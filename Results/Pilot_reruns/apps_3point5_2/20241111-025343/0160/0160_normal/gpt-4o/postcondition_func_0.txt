The function func_1 accepts a list with at least 2 elements, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list using the math module's gcd function, and returns the gcd_result. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function returns the initial value of the list as gcd_result. It is assumed that the input list is valid and contains numerical elements.
