According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and the integer division result of x by 1, `x` is a perfect square, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains 1 and the integer division result of x by 1, `x` is a perfect square, `i` is 2**
