Output State: **If x is a perfect square, the loop calculates all the divisors of x and stores them in the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` will contain 1, the square root of x, and all integers that evenly divide x. If x is not a perfect square, the loop does not execute and the set `divisors` remains empty.**
