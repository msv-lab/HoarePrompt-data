The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The precondition for `x` is that it is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500. If `x` is a perfect square, the set `divisors` will contain 1, the square root of x, and all integers that evenly divide x. If `x` is not a perfect square, the set `divisors` will remain empty, and the function returns the sorted `divisors` in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x`, check if it is a perfect square, and return the divisors accordingly. If `x` is not a perfect square, the function returns the sorted divisors in reverse order. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns the divisors of x if it is a perfect square. If x is not a perfect square, it returns the sorted divisors in reverse order.**
