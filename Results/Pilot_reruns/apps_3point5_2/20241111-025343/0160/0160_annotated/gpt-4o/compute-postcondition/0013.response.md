According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the previous `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by the previous `i` if `x % i == 0. Additionally, if `x % i == 0`, `divisors` is updated to include the value of `i` and the new integer division result of `x` by `i`, covering all possible divisors of the perfect square `x`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `divisors` set should now include the value of the current `i` and the new integer division result of `x` by the current `i` if `x % i == 0`. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the current `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by the current `i` if `x % i == 0.**
