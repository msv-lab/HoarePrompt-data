According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is such that the square root of `x` is an integer. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be a perfect square. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a perfect square, and `i` is 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a perfect square, `i` is 1**
