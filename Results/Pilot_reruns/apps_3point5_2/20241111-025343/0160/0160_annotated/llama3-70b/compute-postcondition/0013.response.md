Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. If `max_divisor` is greater than `i`, then `max_divisor` remains the same. Otherwise, `max_divisor` is updated to `i`. Since `max_divisor` is initially greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, the value of `max_divisor` will remain the same or be updated to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is either the initial value of `max_divisor` or 1.
Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is either the initial value of `max_divisor` or 1**
