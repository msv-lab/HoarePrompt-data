According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `gcd`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is set based on the conditions provided. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the loop to continue since the loop goes up to the square root of `gcd`.
State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `max_divisor` is the maximum value between 3 and `gcd // 3` if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. Otherwise, `max_divisor` remains unchanged**
