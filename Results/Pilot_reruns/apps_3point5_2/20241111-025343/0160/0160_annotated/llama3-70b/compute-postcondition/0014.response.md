Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and the floor division of `gcd` by `i`. The initial state indicates that `max_divisor` is either the initial value or 1. Depending on the values of `gcd` and `i`, `max_divisor` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is updated based on the calculation**
