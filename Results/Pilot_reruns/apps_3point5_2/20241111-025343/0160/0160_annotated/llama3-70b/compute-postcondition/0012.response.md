According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gcd`. If `gcd` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, since the initial state is unknown, we need to ensure that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` starts from 1, so the state adjustment needs to include `i` initialized to 1.
State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
