Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `i` multiplied by itself does not equal `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. In all cases, the variables `gcd`, `i`, and `max_divisor` retain their initial values and relationships.***
