According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, i is 2, A is a list of N positive integers with at least 1 element, gcd is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor between gcd and A[i]**
