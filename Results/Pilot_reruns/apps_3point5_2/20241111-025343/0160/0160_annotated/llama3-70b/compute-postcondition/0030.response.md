The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it works with the following constraints:
- N and K are positive integers.
- A is a list of N positive integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N.

The function `func` does not have a specific return value provided in the given constraints.
