According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. Since `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be incremented by 1.
State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
