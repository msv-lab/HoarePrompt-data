Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `gcd % i` equals 0, then the `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `gcd // i`. Otherwise, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
