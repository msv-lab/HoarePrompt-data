Example Answer:
The `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`, which is 3. Since `max_divisor` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 3, the new value of `max_divisor` becomes 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is 3.
Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is 3**
