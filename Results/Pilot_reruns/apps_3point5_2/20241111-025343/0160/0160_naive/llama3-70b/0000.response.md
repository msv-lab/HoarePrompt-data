Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates over all possible divisors of the gcd and updates the max_divisor accordingly. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The loop to find the maximum divisor iterates up to the square root of gcd and checks for all possible divisors. The logic of the program is sound and covers all scenarios, making it correct.
