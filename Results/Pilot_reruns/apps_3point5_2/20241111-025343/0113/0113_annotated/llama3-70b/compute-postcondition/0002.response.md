Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be the previous positive integer plus 1. The value of `k` remains the same, and `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer plus 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`**
