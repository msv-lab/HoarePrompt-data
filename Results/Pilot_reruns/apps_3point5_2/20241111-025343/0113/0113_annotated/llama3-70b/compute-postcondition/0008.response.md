Output State: **if n is not divisible by 10 to the power of k then after the loop executes n will be a positive integer greater than the initial value of n plus 2, k will remain the same non-negative integer, x will be recalculated as 10 to the power of k with the updated value of n. If n is already divisible by 10 to the power of k then the loop will not execute and the values of n, k, and x will remain the same as the initial state**
