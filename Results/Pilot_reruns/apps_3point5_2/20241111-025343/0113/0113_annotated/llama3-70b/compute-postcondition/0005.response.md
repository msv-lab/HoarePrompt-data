According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of the expression `n % x != 0`. If this expression is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer plus 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is recalculated as 10 to the power of `k` with the updated value of `n`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the expression `n % x != 0` is true. This means that `n` must not be divisible by `x`.

Therefore, to adjust the states:
- We need to increment `n` by 1 to ensure that it remains a positive integer plus 4.
- We need to keep `k` as a non-negative integer.
- We need to recalculate `x` as 10 to the power of `k` with the updated value of `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer plus 4, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is recalculated as 10 to the power of `k` with the updated value of `n`**
