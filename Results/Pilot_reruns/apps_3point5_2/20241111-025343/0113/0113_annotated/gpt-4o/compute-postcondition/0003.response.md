The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8. The function calculates a `multiplier` value that is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. It then calculates a value `x` using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` and returns the calculated value `x`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculate a `multiplier` value based on `k`, calculate `x` using the given formula, and return the calculated value `x`.
