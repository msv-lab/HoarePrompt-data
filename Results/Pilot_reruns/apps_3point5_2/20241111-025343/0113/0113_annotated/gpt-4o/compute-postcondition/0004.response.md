Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two positive integer parameters n and k, calculates a multiplier value based on k, computes x using the formula n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), and returns the resulting value x. The function ensures that n is within the range 1 to 10^9 and k is between 0 and 8.**
