Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The variable `multiplier` is a predefined value, and `n` is a positive integer. The `math.gcd()` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; `x` is the result of the calculation `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; `x` is the result of the calculation `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`**
