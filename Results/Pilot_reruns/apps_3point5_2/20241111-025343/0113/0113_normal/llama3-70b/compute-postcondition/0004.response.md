Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by 1, but the initial value of `n` is unknown. The values of `k` and `x` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
