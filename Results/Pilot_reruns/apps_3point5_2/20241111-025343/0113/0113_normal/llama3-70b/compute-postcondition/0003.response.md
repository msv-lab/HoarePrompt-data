According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `x`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `n` must still result in `n % x` not being equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
