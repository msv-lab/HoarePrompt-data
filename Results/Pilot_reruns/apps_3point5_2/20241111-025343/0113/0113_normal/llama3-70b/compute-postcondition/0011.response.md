Functionality: The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` as input. It then calculates the smallest multiple of 10 raised to the power of `k` that is greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved by increasing `n` iteratively until it becomes divisible by the calculated value. Finally, the function prints the resulting value of `n`. The function does not have any return value. Edge cases to consider include when `n` is already divisible by `x` and when the input values are at their extreme limits.
