Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the k-rounding of a given positive integer `n`. It first calculates a `multiplier` by raising 10 to the power of `k`. 
- Then it computes `x` by multiplying `n` with `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`.
- This approach aligns with the problem description, as it aims to find the minimum positive integer that ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by `n`.
- The code handles all possible values of `n` and `k` within the specified ranges and produces the correct output for all given examples. 
- Therefore, the code is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
