Example Answer: 
The program simply prints '='. There is no impact on the variables `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` without leading zeros**
