Functionality: ** The function takes two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' as strings. It then compares the values of 'a' and 'b' and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if 'a' is less than 'b', and '>' if 'a' is greater than 'b'. The function does not handle cases where 'a' and 'b' are not valid non-negative integers. **
