The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return the sum of numbers 'a' and 'b', which are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return the sum of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' represented as strings. 
Functionality: **The function returns the sum of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' represented as strings.**
