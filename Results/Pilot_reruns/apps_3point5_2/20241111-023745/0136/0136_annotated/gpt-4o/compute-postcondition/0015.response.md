Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are elements of `data` with leading zeros stripped. If `a` is empty, it is assigned the string '0'. In all cases, `b` remains unchanged. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
