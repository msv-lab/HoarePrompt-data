Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the '>' symbol to the console. There are no variables being manipulated or changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros stripped. If `a` is empty, it is assigned the string '0'. `b` is the second element of `data` with leading zeros stripped.**
