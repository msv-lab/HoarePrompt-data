Correctness: True

Explanation: The code reads two very long integers, strips leading zeros, and compares the lengths of the integers to determine which one is greater. The code then correctly prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison result. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem description and the provided examples. The annotations provide additional clarity on the logic flow of the code, but they do not introduce any contradictory information that would suggest the code is incorrect. Since the code aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all cases, the correctness is deemed to be True.
