Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b as a whole line or token.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both a and b using the `lstrip('0')` function.
3. It compares the lengths of a and b first, and if they are not equal, it prints the symbol "<" or ">" accordingly.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b as strings and prints the symbol "<", ">" or "=" based on the comparison.
5. The program handles the case where a or b may be '0' by checking if they are empty strings after removing leading zeroes.
