Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two very long integers a and b from input and removes any leading zeroes. Then it compares the two numbers and prints "<" if a is less than b, ">" if a is greater than b, and "=" if a is equal to b. The logic used in the program correctly handles the comparison of two very large numbers and the removal of leading zeroes. The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
