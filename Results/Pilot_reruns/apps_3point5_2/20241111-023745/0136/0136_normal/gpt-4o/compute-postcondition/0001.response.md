Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing leading zeros. The data in `data[0]` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, `a` now holds a non-negative integer value with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros**
