Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing any leading zeroes. The initial value of `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes. After executing the code, the value of `b` will be the input string without any leading zeroes. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without any leading zeroes.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without any leading zeroes**
