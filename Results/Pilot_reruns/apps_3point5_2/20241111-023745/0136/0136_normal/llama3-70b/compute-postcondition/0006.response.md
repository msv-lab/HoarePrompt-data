Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without any leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'.***
