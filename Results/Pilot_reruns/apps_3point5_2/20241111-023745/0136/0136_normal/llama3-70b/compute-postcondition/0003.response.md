Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('<')` simply prints the character '<' to the console. There is no impact on the variables `a` and `b` based on this code snippet.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without any leading zeroes**
