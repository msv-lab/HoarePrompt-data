Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input after removing any leading zeroes. The input is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes**
