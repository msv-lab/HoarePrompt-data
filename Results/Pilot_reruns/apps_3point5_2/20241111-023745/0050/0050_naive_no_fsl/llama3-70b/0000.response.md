Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by sorting the buying and selling opportunities in ascending and descending order respectively. It then iterates through the buying opportunities to buy as many shares as possible with the available money, and then iterates through the selling opportunities to sell all the shares bought. The logic of buying and selling shares is implemented correctly, ensuring that the maximum number of bourles is held after the evening. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs.
