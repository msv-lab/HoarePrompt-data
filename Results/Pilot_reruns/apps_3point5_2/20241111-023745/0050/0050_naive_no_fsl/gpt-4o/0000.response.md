Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then checks if it is profitable to buy and sell shares based on these prices. If it is profitable, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling the shares. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
