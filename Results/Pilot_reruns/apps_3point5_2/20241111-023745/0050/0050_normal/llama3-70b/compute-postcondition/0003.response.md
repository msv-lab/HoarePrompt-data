Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `b` are affected by this sorting. The output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values sorted in ascending order**
