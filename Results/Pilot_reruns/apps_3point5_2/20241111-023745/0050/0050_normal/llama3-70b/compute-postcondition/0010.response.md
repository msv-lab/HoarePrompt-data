Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, `shares`, `i` are assigned values from input. `b` is sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`, `i` remains 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks. All variables maintain their initial values and relations after the if-else block executes, considering all possible cases and edge conditions.***
