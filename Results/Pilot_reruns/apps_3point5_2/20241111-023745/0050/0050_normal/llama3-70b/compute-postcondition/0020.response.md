Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are assigned values from input. `b` is sorted in descending order. If r >= s[i+1], then shares is updated by adding the integer division of r by s[i+1] and r is updated to the remainder of the division. If r < s[i+1], then the program breaks out of the loop without any changes to the variables. All variables retain their original values and relationships.***
