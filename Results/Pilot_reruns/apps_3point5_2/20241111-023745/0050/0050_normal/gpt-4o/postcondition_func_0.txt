The function `func` reads three integers as input, calculates certain values based on those inputs, and prints the result. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial investment, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total money after selling all shares. The function then prints the total amount of money. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
