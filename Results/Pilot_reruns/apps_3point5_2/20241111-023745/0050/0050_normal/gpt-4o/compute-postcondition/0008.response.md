Example Answer:
`total_bourles` is calculated as the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are dependent on the initial values of `r`, `min_buy_price`, and `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`; `total_bourles` is the calculated total amount of bourles.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`; `total_bourles` is the calculated total amount of bourles**
