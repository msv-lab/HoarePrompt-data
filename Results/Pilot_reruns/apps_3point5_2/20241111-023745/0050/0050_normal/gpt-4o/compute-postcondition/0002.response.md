Example Answer:
A list `b` is created by converting the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `b` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `b` is a list of integers**
