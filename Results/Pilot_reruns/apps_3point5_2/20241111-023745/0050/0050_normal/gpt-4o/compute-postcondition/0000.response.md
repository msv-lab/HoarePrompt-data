Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers**
