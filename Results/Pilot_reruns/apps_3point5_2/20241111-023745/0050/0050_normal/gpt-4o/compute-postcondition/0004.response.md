Example Answer:
The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in the list `b`. The previous values of `b`, `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`**
