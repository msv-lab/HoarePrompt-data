Example Answer: 
The list `b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting**
