Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input split by whitespace. The values of `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned from the input, and `s` is a list of integers based on the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a list of integers based on the input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a list of integers based on the input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split**
