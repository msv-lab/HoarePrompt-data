Example Answer:
`r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]`. The value of `shares` is based on the division of `r` and `s[i]`. If `m` is greater than 0, then `shares` is updated accordingly, and `r` is also updated. Otherwise, all variables maintain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, shares are updated based on the division of `r` and `s[i]`, `r` is updated accordingly, otherwise all variables maintain their initial values.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, shares are updated based on the division of `r` and `s[i]`, `r` is updated accordingly, otherwise all variables maintain their initial values**
