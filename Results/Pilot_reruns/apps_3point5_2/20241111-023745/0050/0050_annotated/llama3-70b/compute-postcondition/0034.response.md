Example Answer: 
`r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Since `shares` is 0, the value of `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`**
