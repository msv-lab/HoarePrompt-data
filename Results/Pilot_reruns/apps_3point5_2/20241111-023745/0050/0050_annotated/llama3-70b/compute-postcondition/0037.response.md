Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `shares` is then reset to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is not greater than 0, `r` is still updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
