Example Answer:
The input values are converted to a list of integers `s` using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, and `s` is a list of integers based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a list of integers based on the input values**
