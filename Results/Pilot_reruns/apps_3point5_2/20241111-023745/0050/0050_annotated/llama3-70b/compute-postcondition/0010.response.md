Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input. `s` is a sorted list of integers based on the input values. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in reverse order. `shares` is either incremented by the floor division of `r` and `s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of dividing `r` by `s[i]`, or `shares` remains 0 and the loop is broken if `r` is less than `s[i]`. `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and all variables maintain their initial assignments.***
