According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is a non-zero value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is now assigned the previous value of `b` after the modulo operation, and `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is now assigned the previous value of `b` after the modulo operation, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`**
