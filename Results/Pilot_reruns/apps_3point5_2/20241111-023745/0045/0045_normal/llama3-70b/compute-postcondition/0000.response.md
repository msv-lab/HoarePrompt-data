Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is then assigned the value of `a % b`. The outcome of `a % b` depends on the previous values of `a` and `b`, which are unknown in this case. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `a` is now assigned the result of `a % b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped, and `a` is now assigned the result of `a % b`**
