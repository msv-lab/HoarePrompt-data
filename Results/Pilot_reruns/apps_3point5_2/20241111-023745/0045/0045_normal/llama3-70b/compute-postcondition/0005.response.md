According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is now assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `b` must not be 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is now assigned the previous value of `b`, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
