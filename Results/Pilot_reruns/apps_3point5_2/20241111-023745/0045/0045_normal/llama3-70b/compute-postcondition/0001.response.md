According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `a` is now assigned the result of `a % b`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` should be adjusted to not equal 0.
State: **`a` is now assigned the result of `a % b`, `b` is not equal to 0**
