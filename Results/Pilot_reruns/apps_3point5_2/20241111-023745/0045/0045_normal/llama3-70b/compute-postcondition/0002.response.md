Example Answer:
Initially, `a` is assigned the result of `a % b`, and `b` is not equal to 0. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, the value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b` and the value of `b` becomes the result of `a % b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now assigned the previous value of `b` after the modulo operation, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`.
Output State: **`a` is now assigned the previous value of `b` after the modulo operation, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`**
