Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The variables `min_sum`, `d`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`**
