According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `(k - 1)` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be within the range from `(k - 1)` to `1`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to `k - 4`.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is decreased by 2, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 4`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
