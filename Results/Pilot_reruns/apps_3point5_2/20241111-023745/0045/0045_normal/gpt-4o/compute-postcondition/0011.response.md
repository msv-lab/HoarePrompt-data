In order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `k - 1` to 0, the value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1. In this case, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to `k - 2`.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`.**
