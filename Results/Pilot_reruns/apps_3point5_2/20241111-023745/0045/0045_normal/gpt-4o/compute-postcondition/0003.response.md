Example Answer:
The value of `n` is divided by `min_sum`, which is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is assigned the result of the division. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1**
