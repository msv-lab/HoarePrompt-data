The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. If `min_sum`, which is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function modifies the elements in `sequence` based on certain conditions until `remainder` reaches 0. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and the function returns -1.
