The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. The function returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return the value of `a`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10, and returns the value of a.**
