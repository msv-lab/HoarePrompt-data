Example Answer:
The values of a and b are swapped, and then a is assigned the value of a modulo b. The previous values of a and b are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10**
