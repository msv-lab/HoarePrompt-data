Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the new values of `a` and `b` depend on the previous values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **The new values of `a` and `b` after the operation**
