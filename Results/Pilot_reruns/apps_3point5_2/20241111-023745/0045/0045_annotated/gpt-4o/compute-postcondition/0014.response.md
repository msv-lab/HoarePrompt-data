Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is recalculated as `remainder - 1`, `sequence` is updated with `sequence[i]` incremented by 1, `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
