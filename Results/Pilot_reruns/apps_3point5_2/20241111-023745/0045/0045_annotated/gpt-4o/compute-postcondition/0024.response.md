The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case 1:
If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` inclusive (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.

Case 2:
If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` inclusive (denoted as `min_sum`) is not greater than `n`, the function enters a loop where `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive. The function will adjust `n` accordingly, decrement `remainder` by the number of executed iterations, update `sequence` with elements incremented by 1, start `i` at `k-1` and decrement by 1 each iteration, ensuring `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `remainder` becomes 0, the loop exits and the function returns the updated `sequence`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of integers up to a certain point, and based on the comparison with `n`, either return -1 or return an updated sequence of elements based on the sum of integers and adjustments made during the loop execution.
