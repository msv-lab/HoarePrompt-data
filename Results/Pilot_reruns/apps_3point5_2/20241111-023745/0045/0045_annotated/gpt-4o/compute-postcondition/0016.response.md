According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k-2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k-3`. The state of `min_sum`, `n`, `remainder`, and `sequence` does not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged. If `remainder` is 0, the loop will break, so it should be checked before proceeding to the next iteration.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is recalculated as `remainder - 1`, `sequence` is updated with `sequence[i]` incremented by 1, `i` is `k-3`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
