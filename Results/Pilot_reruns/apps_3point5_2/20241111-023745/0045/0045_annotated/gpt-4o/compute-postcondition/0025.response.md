Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` inclusive (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function enters a loop where `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive. During the loop execution, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is decremented by the number of iterations, and `sequence` is updated with elements incremented by 1. The loop continues until `remainder` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the updated `sequence`.**
