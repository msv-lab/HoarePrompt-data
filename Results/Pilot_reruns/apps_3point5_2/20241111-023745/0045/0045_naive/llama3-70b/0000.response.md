Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two inputs n and k, representing the positive integer number and the length of the sequence to be generated. It then calculates the sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The program works correctly by generating the sequence in a strictly increasing manner and ensures that each element of the sequence is divisible by the greatest common divisor. If there is no possible sequence, it correctly outputs -1. 

The program covers all potential cases as it handles scenarios where n < k and generates the sequence accordingly. Additionally, it correctly outputs -1 if there is no possible sequence. The logic of the program is sound and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
