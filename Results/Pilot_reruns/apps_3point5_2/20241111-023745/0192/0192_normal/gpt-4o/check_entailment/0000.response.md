Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, and then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases as it correctly calculates the difference between `x` and `y`, then divides by 2 and adds the remainder if there is an odd difference, which represents the number of seconds required to reach the desired equilateral triangle side length `y`. The examples provided in the problem description also confirm that the code is working correctly.
