Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). Given that x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, the difference (x - y) will always be an even number since x and y are at least 3 units apart. Therefore, (x - y) // 2 will result in half of the difference, and (x - y) % 2 will always be 0. Hence, the total result will be half of the difference between x and y. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, the result of the calculation is half of the difference between x and y.**
