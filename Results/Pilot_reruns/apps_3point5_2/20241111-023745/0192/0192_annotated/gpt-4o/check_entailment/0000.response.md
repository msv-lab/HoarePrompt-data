Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where 3 <= y < x <= 100,000. Then it calculates and prints half of the difference between `x` and `y`, rounding up if necessary. This aligns with the problem description where Memory needs to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting side length x by modifying the length of a single side in each second. The code handles this by calculating the minimum number of seconds required to reach the desired side length y. The provided examples also match the expected output based on the problem description. Additionally, the code annotations are consistent with the calculation being performed in the code.
