Example Answer: 
`x` and `y` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of `x` and `y` must satisfy the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is x and y are assigned integer values based on user input satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are assigned integer values based on user input satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
