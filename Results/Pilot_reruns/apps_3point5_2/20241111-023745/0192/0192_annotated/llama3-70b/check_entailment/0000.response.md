Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. It does this by simply calculating the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to modify the sides of the triangle accordingly to reach the desired length. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the annotations also align with the problem description by providing examples that demonstrate the correct behavior of the code.
