According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop will execute one more time. `numerator` and `denominator` are not mentioned to be dependent on `i` or `k`, so they remain the same. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is calculated based on the values of `total_days` and `i`, `denominator` is now equal to `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
