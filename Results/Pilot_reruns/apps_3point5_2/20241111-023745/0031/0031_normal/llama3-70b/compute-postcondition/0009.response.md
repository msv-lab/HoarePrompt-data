According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the new calculation, `denominator` is equal to the new value after multiplication with `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the new calculation, `denominator` is equal to the new value after multiplication with `total_days`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
