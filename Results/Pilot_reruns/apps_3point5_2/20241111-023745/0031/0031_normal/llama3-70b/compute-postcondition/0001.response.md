Example Answer:
The variable `numerator` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `total_days` is large and based on the value of `n`, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is 1**
