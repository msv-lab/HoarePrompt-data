Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 2 to the power of n, the function prints "1, 1" and returns, otherwise it calculates and prints specific values based on the given formulas. The function includes calculations involving modular arithmetic and division by a function func_1. The code does not update the state of the program variables if k is greater than 2 to the power of n.**
