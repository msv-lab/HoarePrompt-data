The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if k is greater than 2 to the power of n, the program prints "1, 1" and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 2 to the power of n, it prints "1, 1" and returns. Otherwise, it does not alter the program variables. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, prints "1, 1" and returns if k is greater than 2 to the power of n. Otherwise, it does not change the state of program variables.**
