According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of MOD, numerator, and denominator do not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that k is greater than 0 and i starts from 0.
State: **MOD is 1000003, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, i is 0, k is greater than 0**
