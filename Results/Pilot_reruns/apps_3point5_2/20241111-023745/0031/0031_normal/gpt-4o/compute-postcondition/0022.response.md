Example Answer:
B is assigned the value of p_total, which is the product of 1 to total_days. The variables numerator, denominator, MOD, p_no_shared, and p_shared are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator will contain the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator will contain the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003, p_no_shared is the same as numerator, p_total is equal to denominator, p_shared is calculated using the formula (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is assigned the value of p_shared, B is equal to p_total.
Output State: **numerator will contain the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator will contain the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003, p_no_shared is the same as numerator, p_total is equal to denominator, p_shared is calculated using the formula (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is assigned the value of p_shared, B is equal to p_total**
