Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Looking at the code and the description, the program seems to correctly calculate the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The code properly handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting "1 1" as mentioned in the problem description. The calculations in the function func_2 utilize modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and reduce the values of A and B to be coprime before printing them modulo 10^6 + 3. Additionally, the functions func_1 and func_2 work together to find the greatest common divisor and calculate the probability fraction for the given inputs. Since all aspects of the code align with the problem description, the correctness of the program can be considered true.
