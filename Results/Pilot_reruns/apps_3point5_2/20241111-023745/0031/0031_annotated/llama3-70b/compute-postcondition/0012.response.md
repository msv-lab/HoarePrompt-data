According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(2^n - 1) * (total_days - i)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^(n+1), `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days**
