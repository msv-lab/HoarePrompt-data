Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer. The value of `n` can be between 1 and 10^18, so `total_days` can be any value between 2 and 2^(10^18). Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
