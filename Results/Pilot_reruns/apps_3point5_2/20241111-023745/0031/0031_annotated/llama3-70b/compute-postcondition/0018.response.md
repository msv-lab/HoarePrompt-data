The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. Within the function, the `numerator` is updated after dividing by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`), `denominator` is modified based on loop operations, and `gcd` holds the greatest common divisor of the final values. The function then returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` satisfying the constraints, updates `numerator` after dividing by `gcd`, modifies `denominator`, calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of the final values, and returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10.**
