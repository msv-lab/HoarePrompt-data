The function func_1 accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the `numerator` and `denominator` based on the loop operations, finds the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of the final values, and returns the remainder of the `numerator` divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of the `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
