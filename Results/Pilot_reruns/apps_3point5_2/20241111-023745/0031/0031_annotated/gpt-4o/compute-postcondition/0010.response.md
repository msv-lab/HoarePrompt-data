According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated according to the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
