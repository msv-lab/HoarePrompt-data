Example Answer: 
p_total is assigned the value of denominator, and denominator is the product of total_days modulo MOD. Since total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, the product is 2^n modulo MOD. Therefore, p_total is 2^n modulo MOD. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is the product of (total_days - k) modulo MOD, denominator is the product of total_days modulo MOD, MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, p_total is 2^n modulo MOD.
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - k) modulo MOD, denominator is the product of total_days modulo MOD, MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, p_total is 2^n modulo MOD**
