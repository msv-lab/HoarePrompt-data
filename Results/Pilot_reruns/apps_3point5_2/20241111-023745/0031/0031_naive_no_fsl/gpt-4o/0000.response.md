Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. It handles the case where there are more people (k) than days in a year (2^n).
3. The program computes the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction correctly.
4. It reduces the fraction to its irreducible form using the `func_1` function.
5. The program outputs the final result modulo 10^6 + 3 as required.
6. The program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for all inputs.
