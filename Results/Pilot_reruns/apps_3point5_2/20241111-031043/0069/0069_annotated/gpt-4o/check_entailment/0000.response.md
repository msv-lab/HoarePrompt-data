Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

An example where the code does not work as expected is for the input:
4
6 10
010010
5 3
10101
1 0
0
2 0
01

For the first test case where n=6 and x=10, the correct output should be 3. However, the code incorrectly outputs 0.

The annotations in the code do not accurately reflect the logic implemented in the program. They suggest that the code should handle cases where balance=0 and x is in prefix_balances, but the implementation does not cover this scenario correctly. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes correctly.

Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
