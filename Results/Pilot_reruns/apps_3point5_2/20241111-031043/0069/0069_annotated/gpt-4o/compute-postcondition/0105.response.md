According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more results to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, or `balance` is not 0 and count is greater than 0. Since the loop can execute again, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, or `balance` is not 0 and count is greater than 0**
