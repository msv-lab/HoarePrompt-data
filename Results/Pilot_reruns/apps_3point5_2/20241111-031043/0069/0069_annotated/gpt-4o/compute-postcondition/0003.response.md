Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The states of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `index` is 1.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `index` is 1**
