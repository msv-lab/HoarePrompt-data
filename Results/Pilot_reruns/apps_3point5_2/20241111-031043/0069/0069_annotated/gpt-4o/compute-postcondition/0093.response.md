Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, `count` is increased by 1. If the same condition is satisfied after the if statement, `count` is increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.***
