Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then `count` is increased by 2. If the same condition is not satisfied, `count` remains unchanged.***
