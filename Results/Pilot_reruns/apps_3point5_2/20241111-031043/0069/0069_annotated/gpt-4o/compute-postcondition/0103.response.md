According to the code, the loop will execute if the `results` list is not empty. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are:
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once.
- If `balance` is 0, then `x` must be in `prefix_balances` for the loop to append -1 to `results`.
- If `balance` is not 0, the loop will append the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions specified.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, or `balance` is not 0 and count is greater than 0**
