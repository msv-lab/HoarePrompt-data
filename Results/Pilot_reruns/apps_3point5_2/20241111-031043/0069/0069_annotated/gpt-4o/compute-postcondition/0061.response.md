Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1` with at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1.***
