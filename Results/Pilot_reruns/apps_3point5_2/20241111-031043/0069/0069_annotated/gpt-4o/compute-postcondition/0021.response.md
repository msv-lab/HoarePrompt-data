Example Answer:
The code appends 0 to the list `results`. Since there is no specific information provided about the previous values of the variables, we can assume that `results` is an empty list before this operation. Therefore, after appending 0 to `results`, the list will contain one element which is 0.
Output State: **`results` is a list containing 0**
