According to the code, the loop will iterate from 1 to n inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the loop index `i` should be incremented to the next value after 3, which is 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `i` is 4, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the formula provided**
