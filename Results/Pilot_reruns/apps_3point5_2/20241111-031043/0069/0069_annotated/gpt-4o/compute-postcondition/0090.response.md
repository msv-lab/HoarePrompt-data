Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `count` is increased by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied. This increment occurs for all valid values of `x` that satisfy the condition.***
