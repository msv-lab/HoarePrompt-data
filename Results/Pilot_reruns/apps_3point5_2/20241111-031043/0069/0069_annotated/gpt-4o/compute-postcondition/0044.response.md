According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, and `i` is 1.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `i` is 1**
