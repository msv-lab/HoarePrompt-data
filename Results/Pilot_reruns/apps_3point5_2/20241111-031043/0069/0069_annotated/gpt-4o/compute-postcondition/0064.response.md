Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1` with at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. After the if statement executes, `count` is guaranteed to be 3, ensuring that the loop will execute one more time as required based on the conditions specified. The state of the program maintains the necessary conditions for further iteration as specified in the task requirements.***
