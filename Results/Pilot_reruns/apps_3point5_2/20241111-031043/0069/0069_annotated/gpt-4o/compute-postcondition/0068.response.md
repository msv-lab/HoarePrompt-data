Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is updated based on the conditions specified in the for loop for each element in `prefix_balances`, and the final count value is appended to `results`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases arising from the execution of the if else block.***
