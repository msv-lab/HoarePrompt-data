According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the formula provided**
