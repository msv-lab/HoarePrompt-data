Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, the previous value of `count` is unknown. The output state is: `count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has at least two elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has at least two elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances**.
