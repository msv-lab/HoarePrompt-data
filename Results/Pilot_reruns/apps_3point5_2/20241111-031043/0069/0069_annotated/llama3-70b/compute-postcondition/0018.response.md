Example Answer:
The expression inside the print statement calculates the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). Substituting the given initial state values into the expression:
- x - balance is calculated where balance is cnt0 - cnt1.
- cnt0 and cnt1 are counts of '0's and '1's in the string s respectively.
- The result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is then printed.

Output State: **T is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, x is an integer, s is a binary string of length n obtained from input, n and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input, cnt0 is the count of '0's in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, and the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed.**
