Example Answer:
The expression calculates (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. The values of x, balance, cnt0, and cnt1 are provided from the initial state. After substituting these values, the expression is evaluated to get the result. 
Output State: **T-1, n, x, s are positive integers. s is a binary string of length n. cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s. balance is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in s. The result of the expression is printed.**
