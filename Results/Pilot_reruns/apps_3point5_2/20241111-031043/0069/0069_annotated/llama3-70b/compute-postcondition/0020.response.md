Postcondition: ***T, n, x, s are positive integers. s is a binary string of length n. n and x are assigned values from the input. cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s. balance is cnt0 - cnt1. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible edge cases and scenarios after the execution of the if else block.***
