Postcondition: ***T-1, n, x, s are positive integers. The binary string s of length n contains cnt0 '0's and cnt1 '1's. balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints -1. Otherwise, if (x - balance) is not divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints the result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. The program handles various cases including when the division results in a whole number or a remainder, ensuring the validity of the division operation.***
