Postcondition: ***T-1, n, x, s are positive integers. s is a binary string of length n. n and x are assigned values from the input. cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s. balance is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in s. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. The program ensures that the division is valid and handles different scenarios where the division might result in a whole number or a remainder.***
