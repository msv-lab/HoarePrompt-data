Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from user input, `x` is an integer from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the variables and their relationships after the if-else block executes.***
