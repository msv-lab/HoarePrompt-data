Example Answer: 
The input string is stored in variable `s`. The variables `T`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from user input, `x` is an integer from user input, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from user input, `x` is an integer from user input, `s` is the input string**
