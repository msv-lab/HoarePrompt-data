Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` and `x` are integers from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios including edge cases where the denominator might be zero or the condition in the if statement is not met.***
