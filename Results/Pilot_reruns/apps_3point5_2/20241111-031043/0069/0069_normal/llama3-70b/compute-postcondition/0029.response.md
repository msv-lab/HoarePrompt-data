Postcondition: ***`T-1`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance` are integers. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers all possible scenarios involving the input values and their relationships within the if-else block.***
