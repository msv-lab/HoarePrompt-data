Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from user input, `x` is an integer from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers the scenario when the condition is true, false, and all boundary cases related to the calculations and their effects on the variables.***
