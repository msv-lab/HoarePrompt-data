Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least three zero values. If (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the result is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by 1. The program state is maintained with the updated `count` value while preserving the list `prefix_balances` with its original conditions.***
