Postcondition: ***`s` has a length greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has updated values, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `count` is 1. If ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0), then `count` is increased by 1.***
