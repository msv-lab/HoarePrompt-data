Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length (n + 1), `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, and `prefix_balances` is updated based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
