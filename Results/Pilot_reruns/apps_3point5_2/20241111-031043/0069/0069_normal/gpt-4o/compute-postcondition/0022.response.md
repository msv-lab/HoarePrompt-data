Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `n` is an integer. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop calculates the prefix balances based on `s`, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and a new element 0 is appended to `results`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
