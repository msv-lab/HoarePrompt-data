Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, prefix_balances is a list with at least one non-zero value, x is an integer value from the list data at index 3, index is 5, balance is calculated based on the string s, i is equal to n + 1, T is greater than 1, count is an integer. If (x - b) % balance is equal to 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0, then count is incremented by 1.***
