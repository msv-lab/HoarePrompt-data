Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 2. The value at index 2 of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has updated values, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is calculated based on the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `T` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has updated values, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is calculated based on the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n + 1, `T` is greater than 1**
