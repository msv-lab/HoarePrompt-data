The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` representing the length of a binary string `s`, an integer `x` representing the desired balance, and the binary string `s` itself. The function is expected to handle these test cases according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer n representing the length of a binary string s, an integer x representing the desired balance, and the binary string s itself.
