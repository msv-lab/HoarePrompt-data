Example Answer:
`results` is appended with the value -1. The loop calculates the prefix balances based on the string `s`, incrementing the balance by 1 if the character is '0' and decrementing by 1 if the character is '1'. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `results` has -1 appended to it, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.
Output State: **`results` has -1 appended to it, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros**
