Example Answer:
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The value of `count` is increased based on the specified conditions. If the conditions are met, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, no changes occur. The integrity of the `prefix_balances` list is maintained throughout. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `count` is incremented based on the specified conditions, and the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `count` is incremented based on the specified conditions, and the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list**.
