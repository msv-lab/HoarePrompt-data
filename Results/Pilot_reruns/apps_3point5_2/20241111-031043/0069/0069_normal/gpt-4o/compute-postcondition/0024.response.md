According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `prefix_balances` is not empty. Since the list is initially a list of zeros, it needs to be adjusted to have at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified to indicate that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value**
