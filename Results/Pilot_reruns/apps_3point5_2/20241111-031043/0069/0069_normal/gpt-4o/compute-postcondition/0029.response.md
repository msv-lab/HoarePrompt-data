Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least two zero values. If the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur. The postcondition ensures the integrity of the initial state and covers all possible scenarios by accounting for the potential increase in `count` based on the specified conditions.***
