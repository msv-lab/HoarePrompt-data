According to the code, the loop will execute `T` number of times. So, for the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1. At the start of the loop, `index` is not used within the loop, so it can remain as 1. As `results` is an empty list at the start, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`data` is a list of strings based on the input provided, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
