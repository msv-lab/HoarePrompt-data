Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the integer value stored in `data[0]`, which is the first element of the list `data`. The value of `T` depends on the input provided in the list. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings based on the input provided, `T` is an integer value based on the input provided.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings based on the input provided, `T` is an integer value based on the input provided**
