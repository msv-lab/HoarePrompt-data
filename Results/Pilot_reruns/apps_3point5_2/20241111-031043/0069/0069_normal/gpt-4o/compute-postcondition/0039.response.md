Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is not given, but it is assumed to be a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index + 1` would also be a valid index in the list `data`. Therefore, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index `index + 1` in the list `data`. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index `index + 1`**
