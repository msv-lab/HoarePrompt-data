Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the desired balance.
2. It correctly calculates the balance of the given string $s$.
3. It handles the cases where the balance is equal to the desired balance by printing the length of the string + 1.
4. It correctly handles the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference in the count of '0's and '1's in the string.
5. It correctly calculates and prints the number of prefixes for all other cases.
