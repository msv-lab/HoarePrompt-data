Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` work together to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given constraints. The code handles the calculation of block and floor numbers, walking times, elevator times, and overall total time accurately. Additionally, the code annotations provide a clear understanding of the program flow and the expected behavior. All the provided examples in the problem description seem to be correctly handled by the code. Therefore, based on the analysis, the code is correct.
