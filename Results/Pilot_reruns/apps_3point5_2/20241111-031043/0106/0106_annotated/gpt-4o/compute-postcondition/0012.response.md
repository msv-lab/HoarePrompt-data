Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within the specified ranges. It calculates the total time based on the distance between two blocks and floors, considering various time factors such as walking times and exit times. The total time is then returned as the output. However, there seems to be a missing logic where the function does not handle cases where the locations `a` and `b` are out of bounds or invalid. This missing functionality could lead to incorrect time calculations.**
