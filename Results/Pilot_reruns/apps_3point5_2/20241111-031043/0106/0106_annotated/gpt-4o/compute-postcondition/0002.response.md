Example Answer: 
`floor` is assigned the value `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Since we do not have prior information about the values of `floor_within_block` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor`. The division operation `//` will result in an integer value, and then 1 is added to that result. Therefore, the Output State is: Not enough information to determine the exact value of `floor`.
Output State: **Not enough information to determine the exact value of `floor`**
