Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly calculates the time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given conditions.
- It calculates the time to exit Edward's apartment, the time to walk to the target block, the time to walk in either direction around the building, and the time to reach Natasha's floor accurately.
- The function `func_1` uses the provided formulae to determine the time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, and the logic seems correct.
- The code handles the scenario of Edward living on the first floor correctly by setting the time to exit as 0.
- The calculations for all the different time components are done accurately.
- The program seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each one.
