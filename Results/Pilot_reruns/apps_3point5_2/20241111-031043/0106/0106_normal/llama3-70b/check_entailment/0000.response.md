Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description by correctly calculating the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. It considers the circular structure of the building, the time taken to move between blocks and floors, and the waiting time for the lift. The code handles all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that the code behaves as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
