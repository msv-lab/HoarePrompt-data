Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. The value of `a` is mapped to an integer, and `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated according to the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated according to the formula**
