Example Answer:
`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are known. Therefore, after execution, the value of `b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated; `b_floor` is calculated; `b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided**
