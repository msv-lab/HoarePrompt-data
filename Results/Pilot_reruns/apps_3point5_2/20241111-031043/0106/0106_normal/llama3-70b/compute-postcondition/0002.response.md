Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` and `m` are input integers. The value of `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`**
