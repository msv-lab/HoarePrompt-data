The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a list of all possible combinations of three integers `(i, j, l)` where `i`, `j`, `l` are integers such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `1 ≤ j ≤ m`, `1 ≤ l ≤ k`, and `(i*j*l) == a*b`. The function should return this list of combinations. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of all possible combinations of three integers (i, j, l) where i, j, l are integers satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ l ≤ k, and (i*j*l) == a*b.**
