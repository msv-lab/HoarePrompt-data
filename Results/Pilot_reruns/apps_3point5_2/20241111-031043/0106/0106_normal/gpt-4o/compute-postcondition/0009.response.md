Example Answer: 
If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. After calculating the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of the two. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. Finally, `total_time` is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **Dependent on the values of `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time`, `total_time` is calculated based on the provided formula.**
