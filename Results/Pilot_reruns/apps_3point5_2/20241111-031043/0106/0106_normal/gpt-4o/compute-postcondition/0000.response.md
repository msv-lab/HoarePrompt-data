Example Answer:
The variable `block` is calculated based on the formula provided. It uses the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The previous values of these variables are known to be positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the output state is: **m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b; block is calculated based on the given formula.**
Output State: **m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b; block is calculated based on the given formula.**
