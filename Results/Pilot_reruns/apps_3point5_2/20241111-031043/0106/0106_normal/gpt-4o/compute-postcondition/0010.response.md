Example Answer:
The function returns `total_time` based on the provided formula. The value of `total_time` is calculated based on the values of `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time`. Since the initial values of these variables are not provided, the exact value of `total_time` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the values of `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time`**
