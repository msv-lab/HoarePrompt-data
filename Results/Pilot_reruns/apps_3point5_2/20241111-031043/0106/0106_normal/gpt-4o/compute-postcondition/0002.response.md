Example Answer:
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Since no initial values are provided for `floor_within_block` and `k`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b; block is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b; block is calculated based on the given formula**
