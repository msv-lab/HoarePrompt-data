Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues for depublicans and remocrats, and simulates the voting process according to the rules provided. It ensures that employees who are denied the right to vote are removed from the queue and the process continues until there is only one employee left. The program then correctly determines the outcome based on the remaining employee's faction. The program covers all possible cases and correctly predicts the outcome of the vote.
