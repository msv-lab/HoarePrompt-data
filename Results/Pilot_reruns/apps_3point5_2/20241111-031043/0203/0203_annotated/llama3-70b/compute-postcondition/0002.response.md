Example Answer:
`depublicans` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input, depublicans is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input, depublicans is 0**
