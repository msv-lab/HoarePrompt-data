According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `fractions` iterable. Since `fractions` is a string input, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string. Therefore, to adjust the state before the loop starts:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0**
