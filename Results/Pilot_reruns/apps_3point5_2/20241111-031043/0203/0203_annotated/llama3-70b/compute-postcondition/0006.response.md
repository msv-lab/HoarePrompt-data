Example Answer: 
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 1**
