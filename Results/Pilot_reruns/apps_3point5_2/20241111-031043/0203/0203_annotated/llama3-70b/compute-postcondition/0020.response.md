Postcondition: ***If fractions is a non-empty string and contains at least one 'D' fraction, depublicans will be incremented by the number of 'D' fractions and remocrats will be incremented by the number of non-'D' fractions. If depublicans are greater than remocrats, 'D' is printed. If there are no 'D' fractions in fractions, depublicans remain 0 and remocrats are incremented by the total number of fractions. If depublicans are not greater than remocrats, 'R' is printed.***
