Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, so after execution, `depublicans` is increased by 1. The state of `remocrats` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over, depublicans is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over, depublicans is incremented by 1**
