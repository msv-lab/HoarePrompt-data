Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the value of `remocrats`, so after execution, `remocrats` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over, `remocrats` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over, `remocrats` is incremented by 1**
