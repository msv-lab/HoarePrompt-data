Postcondition: ***If `votes` is initially an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty, and the loop does not execute. Otherwise, if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty after the loop finishes, the final state will depend on the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index` in each iteration. The loop will continue executing until either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty.***
