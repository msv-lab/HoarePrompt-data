Example Answer:
`d_index` is added to `n` and then appended to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` is now dependent on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`**
