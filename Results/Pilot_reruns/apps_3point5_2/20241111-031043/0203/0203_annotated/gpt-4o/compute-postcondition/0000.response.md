Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer, so after this assignment, `n` will hold the positive integer entered by the user. The input string votes contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'. No changes are made to the votes string in this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, the input string votes contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'.**
