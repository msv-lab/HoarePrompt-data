Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `r_queue`. Since `i` is 1, after execution, the `r_queue` will contain the value 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` or `r_queue` is updated based on the next character in `votes`, `i` is 1, `v` is the next character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains the value 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` or `r_queue` is updated based on the next character in `votes`, `i` is 1, `v` is the next character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains the value 1**
