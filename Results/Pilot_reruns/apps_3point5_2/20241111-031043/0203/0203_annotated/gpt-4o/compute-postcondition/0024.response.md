Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains a popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index` after the execution of the if-else block.**
