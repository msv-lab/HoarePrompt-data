Output State: 
- *If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty after the loop executes at least once, the loop will continue executing. The values of `n`, `votes`, `r_index`, `d_index`, `d_queue`, and `r_queue` will be updated based on the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index`.*
- *If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, the loop will end, and the final state of the variables will depend on the last comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`.*
- *If `votes` is an empty string initially, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty, and the loop will not execute.*

**If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain non-empty after the loop finishes, the final state will depend on the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index` in each iteration. The loop will continue executing until either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty. If `votes` is empty initially, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.**
