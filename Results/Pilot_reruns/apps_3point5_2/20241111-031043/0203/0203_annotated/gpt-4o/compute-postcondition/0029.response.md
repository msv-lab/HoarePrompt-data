According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. So, for the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must not be empty at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty**
