Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. Since initially, `d_queue` is an empty list and `i` is 0, after execution, `d_queue` will contain [0]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` contains [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` contains [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
