Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`, so `i` which is 1 will be added to `d_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` contains 1, `r_queue` is updated based on the next character in `votes`, `i` is 1, and `v` is the next character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `d_queue` contains 1, `r_queue` is updated based on the next character in `votes`, `i` is 1, and `v` is the next character in the `votes` string**
