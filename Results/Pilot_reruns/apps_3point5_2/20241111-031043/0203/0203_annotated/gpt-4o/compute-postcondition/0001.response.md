Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input string represents the votes cast by `n` employees, with each character being either 'D' or 'R'. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the input string representing the votes.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the input string representing the votes**
