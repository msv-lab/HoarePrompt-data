Example Answer: 
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` which contains the indices of 'D' votes. Depending on the initial state of the program, the value of `d_index` will be the first index from `d_queue`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, and the state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the initial input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, and the state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the initial input**
