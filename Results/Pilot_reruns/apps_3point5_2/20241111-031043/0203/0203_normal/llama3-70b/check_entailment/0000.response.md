Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads the number of employees and their fractions, counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters, and then prints 'D' if the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of 'R' characters, otherwise prints 'R'. The code handles cases where the string length `n` is between 1 and 200,000, and each character in the string is either 'D' or 'R'. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected.
