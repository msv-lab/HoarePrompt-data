Example Answer:
The variable `fractions` is assigned the input string. The input string contains n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, the input string contains n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the input string contains n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'**
