According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list having at least 1 fraction remaining. At the end of the last iteration, the `fraction` variable has been processed from the `fractions` list. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the `fractions` list must still have at least 1 fraction remaining to process.

State: **`n` is an input integer, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; if `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains 0, and `fractions` list has at least 1 fraction. If `fraction` is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 0, `remocrats` is increased by 1, and `fractions` list has at least 1 fraction.**
