Example Answer: 
The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `depublicans` and `fractions` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` remains 0, `remocrats` is increased by 1, `fractions` list has at least 1 fraction.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` remains 0, `remocrats` is increased by 1, `fractions` list has at least 1 fraction**
