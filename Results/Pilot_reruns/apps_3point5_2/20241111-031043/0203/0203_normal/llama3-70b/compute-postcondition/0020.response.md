Postcondition: ***If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If the input string contains 'D' or 'R' characters, the loop will iterate through each character and increment either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the character. After the loop execution, `depublicans` will represent the count of 'D' characters, `remocrats` will represent the count of 'R' characters, and the `fractions` list will have at least `n` fractions. The if-else block prints 'D' if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, otherwise it prints 'R'. No variables are modified by the print statement; hence, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the if-else block executes.***
