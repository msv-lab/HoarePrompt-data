According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. `n` being an input integer does not necessarily affect the loop execution. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the `fractions` list must have at least 1 fraction. At the start of the loop, `depublicans` should be 0 and `remocrats` should be 0. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fractions` list has at least 1 fraction**
