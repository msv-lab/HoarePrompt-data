Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The variable `n` is an input integer, and the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'. The variable `depublicans` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
