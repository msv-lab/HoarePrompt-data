The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and a string `fractions` containing 'D' or 'R' characters. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string. If the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of 'R' characters, it prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not return any specific output. The function handles cases where the string length `n` is between 1 and 200,000, and each character in the string is either 'D' or 'R'.
