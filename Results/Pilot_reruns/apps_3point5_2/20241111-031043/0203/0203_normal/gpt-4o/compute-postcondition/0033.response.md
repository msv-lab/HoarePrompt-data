Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends the value `r_index + n`, where `r_index` and `n` are not defined in the initial state. The `d_index` is updated with the popped value, and `d_queue` becomes one element shorter. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`.
Output State: **`d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`**
