Example Answer:
The integer `i` is appended to the list `d_queue`. As `i` is currently 1, after execution, `d_queue` will contain [1]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining, `d_queue` contains [1], `r_queue` is a list, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining, `d_queue` contains [1], `r_queue` is a list, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`**
