Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The length of the string `votes` will be equal to `n`, and it will consist of characters 'D' and 'R'. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
