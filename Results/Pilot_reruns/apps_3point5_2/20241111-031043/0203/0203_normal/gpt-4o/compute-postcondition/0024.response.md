Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. As `d_queue` is not empty, a value is successfully popped and assigned to `d_index`. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`**
