Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value at the front of `r_queue` by popping it. The value of `r_index` will be the index of the first 'R' character in `votes`. If `r_queue` is empty, an error will occur. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop iterates through the string `votes` and appends the index `i` to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character at that index. If the character is 'D', `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and if the character is 'R', `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`.
