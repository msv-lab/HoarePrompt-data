The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000** and **votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**. The function returns the winning party based on the majority of votes. If there are more 'D' (Democrats) votes, the function returns 'D'; if there are more 'R' (Republicans) votes, the function returns 'R'. If the number of 'D' and 'R' votes are equal, the function returns 'Tie'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the winning party based on the majority of votes in the string.
