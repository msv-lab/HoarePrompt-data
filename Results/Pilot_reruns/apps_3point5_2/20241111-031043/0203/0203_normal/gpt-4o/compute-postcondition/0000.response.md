Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `n` can be any integer in the range 1 to 200,000. The initial state includes the information that `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000. `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000. `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
