According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not mentioned, so we assume they still contain elements. No other specific conditions are provided. Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`d_index`, `r_index`, `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `n` are integers**
