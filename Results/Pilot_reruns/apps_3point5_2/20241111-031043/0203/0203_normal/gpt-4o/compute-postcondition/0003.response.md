Example Answer:
`r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
