Example Answer:
`d_queue` appends the value of `d_index + n`. Since `d_queue` was empty before and `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, and `n` is undefined, the value appended to `d_queue` is `d_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` contains the value of `d_index`, `r_queue` is one element shorter, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` contains the value of `d_index`, `r_queue` is one element shorter, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`**
