Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains only the value 0, else `r_queue` contains only the value 0. In all cases, `i` is 0 and `v` is the first character of `votes`.***
