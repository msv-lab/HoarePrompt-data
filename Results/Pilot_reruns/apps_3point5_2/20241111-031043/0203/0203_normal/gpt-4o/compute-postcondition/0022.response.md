Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through the string `votes`, appending the value of `d_index + n` to the `d_queue` list if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, it appends the sum of `r_index` and `n` to the `r_queue` list. `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`.***
