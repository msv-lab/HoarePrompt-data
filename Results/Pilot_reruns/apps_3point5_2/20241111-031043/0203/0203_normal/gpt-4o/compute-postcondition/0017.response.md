Output State: **The loop iterates through the string `votes` and appends the index `i` to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character at that index. If the character is 'D', `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and if the character is 'R', `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If there are no 'D' or 'R' characters in `votes`, the respective queue will remain empty.**
