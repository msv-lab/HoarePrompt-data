Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` is now one element shorter. The previous values of `d_index` and `d_queue` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter.
Output State: **`d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter**
