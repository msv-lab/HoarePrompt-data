According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `votes` string and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `votes`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 3 characters remaining. If the second character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [1, i] and `r_queue` is a list. If the second character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1 and `d_queue` is a list. In both cases, the program appends the value of `i` to the appropriate queue depending on the condition. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented and adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 3 characters remaining. If the second character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [1, i+1] and `r_queue` is a list. If the second character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1 and `d_queue` is a list.**
