According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. The condition for incrementing `m` is not directly related to `i` and `n`, so no adjustments are necessary for `m`. Since `i` is 2 and the loop starts from 1, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3**
