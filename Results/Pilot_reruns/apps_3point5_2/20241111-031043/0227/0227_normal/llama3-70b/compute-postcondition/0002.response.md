Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the list remains the same but in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) and sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) and sorted in ascending order**
