Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer n as input and a list of n distinct positive integers a.
- It then sorts the list a in ascending order.
- The code then iterates through the list and checks if each element is twice the value of the previous element. If not, it increments the variable m.
- Finally, it prints m if m is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
