Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` with elements left to iterate over, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1, where `a[i] - x` is not present in `assigned, if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks, `can_form` remains False if the loop does not execute at all.**
