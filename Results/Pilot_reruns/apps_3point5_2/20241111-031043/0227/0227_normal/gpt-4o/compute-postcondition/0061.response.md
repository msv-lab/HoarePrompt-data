According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element and `a[i]` has been added to `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element and `a[i]` has been added to `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`**
