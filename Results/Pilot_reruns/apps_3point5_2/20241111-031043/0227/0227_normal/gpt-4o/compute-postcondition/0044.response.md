According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `assigned` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False. So for the loop to be executed, the `assigned` list must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list**
