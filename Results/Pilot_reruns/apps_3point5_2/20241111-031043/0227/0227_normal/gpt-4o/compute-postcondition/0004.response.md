According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is already a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing the first element of list a, and m is 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to set i to 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing the first element of list a, m is 1, i is 1**
