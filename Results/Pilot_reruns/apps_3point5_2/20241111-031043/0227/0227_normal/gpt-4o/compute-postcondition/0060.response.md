Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element and `a[i]` has been added to `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1. If a match is found between `a[i] - x` and an element in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If no match is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` is False.**
