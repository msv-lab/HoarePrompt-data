Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. It then iterates through the list `a` to find if a match exists between the difference of elements and updates a counter `m` accordingly. The function returns the final value of `m`. The code accurately reflects the annotations and covers the case where no match is found between elements in `a`. However, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where `assigned` is empty, which could potentially impact the final value of `m`.**
