Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains the same positive integer, `a` remains a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains all elements from list `a`, `m` is the number of times a new set of numbers had to be assigned to `assigned`, `i` is now equal to `n-1`. If a match is found between `a[i] - x` and an element in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If no match is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` is False. The function returns `m`.**
