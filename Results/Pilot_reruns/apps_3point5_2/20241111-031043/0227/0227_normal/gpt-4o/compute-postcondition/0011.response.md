Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is not empty, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is not empty, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is True**
