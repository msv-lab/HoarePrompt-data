Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1. If a match is found between `a[i] - x` and an element in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If no match is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` is False. After the if statement executes, the variables `n`, `a`, and `i` are incremented by 1, and the state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial conditions.***
