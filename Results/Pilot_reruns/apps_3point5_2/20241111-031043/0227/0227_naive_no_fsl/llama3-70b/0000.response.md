Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It first sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates over it to check if the current element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m` which keeps track of the minimum number of variables needed. Finally, the program prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1 as per the problem description.

The logic in the program is correct and covers all possible cases as required by the problem description. The program handles the input constraints and provides the correct output for the given examples.
