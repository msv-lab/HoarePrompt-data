The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions provided. The function returns a string based on the following conditions:
- If the list `a` contains only one element, the function returns "Only one element".
- If the list `a` contains more than one element and the sum of all elements is greater than 100, the function returns "Sum is greater than 100".
- If neither of the above conditions are met, the function returns "Valid list".
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to analyze the list `a` based on the given preconditions and return a specific string message depending on the characteristics of the list.
