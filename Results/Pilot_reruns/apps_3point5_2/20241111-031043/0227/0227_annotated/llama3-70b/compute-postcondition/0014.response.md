Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by the number of times this condition is met. Otherwise, `m` remains 1. `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is the last value in the range before the loop ends. If the loop doesn't start due to `n` being less than 2, then `m` remains 1.**
