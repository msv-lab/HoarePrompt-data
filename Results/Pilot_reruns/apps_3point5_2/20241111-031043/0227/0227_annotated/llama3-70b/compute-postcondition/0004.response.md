According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `m` is 1, it does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a` is sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.
State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
