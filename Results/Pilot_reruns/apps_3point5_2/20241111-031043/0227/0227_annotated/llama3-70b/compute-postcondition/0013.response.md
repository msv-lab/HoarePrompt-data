According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `m` remains 1. `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 4**
