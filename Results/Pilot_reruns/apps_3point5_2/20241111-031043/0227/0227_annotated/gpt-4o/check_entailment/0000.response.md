Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, checking if the difference between the current integer and any previously assigned integer is in the assigned set. If not, it increments the variable `m` representing the minimum number of variables needed. This process ensures that the operations can be performed according to the given sequence. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the code works, confirming that it aligns with the problem description. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
