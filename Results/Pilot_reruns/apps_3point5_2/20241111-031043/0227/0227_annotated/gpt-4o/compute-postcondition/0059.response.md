Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable that is set to True if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`. The variable `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` was False. If the condition is never met or the list `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the last element in the list `assigned`.***
