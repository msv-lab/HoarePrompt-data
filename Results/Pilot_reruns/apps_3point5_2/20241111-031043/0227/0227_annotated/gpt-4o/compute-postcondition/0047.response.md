Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable that is set to True if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`. The variable `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the list `assigned`. The loop or if statement is terminated with a break statement.***
