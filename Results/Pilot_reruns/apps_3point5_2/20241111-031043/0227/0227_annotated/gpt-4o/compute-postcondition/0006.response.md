According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, the `assigned` set needs to have at least one element. The current state before the loop starts is sufficient for the loop to execute since we only need the `assigned` set to be non-empty.
State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False, `assigned` set is non-empty**
