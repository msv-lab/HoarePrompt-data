Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `a` are distinct positive integers, so sorting them will rearrange the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
