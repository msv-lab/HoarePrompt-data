According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean variable, if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the second element in the list `assigned`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `assigned` must have more than 1 element, and `x` should be the third element in the list `assigned`.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable, if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the third element in the list `assigned**.
