Postcondition: ***The smallest positive integer in list a is added to the set assigned, i is 1, n is greater than 1, can_form is True, assigned set is non-empty, and the loop should continue with the next element in the assigned set. If a[i] - x is present in assigned, then can_form is set to True and the loop breaks.***
