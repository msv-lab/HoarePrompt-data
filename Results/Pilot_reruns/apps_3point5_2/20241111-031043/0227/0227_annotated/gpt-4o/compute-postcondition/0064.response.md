The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers. The function checks if the smallest positive integer in list `a` is in the assigned set. If it is, then `can_form` is set to True. If `can_form` was originally False, it is set to True after the if statement, and `m` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a[i] - x` is in the assigned set, `can_form` remains True, `m` stays 0, and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains True and `m` remains 0. The function returns the value of `m`, which represents the number of times `can_form` was False and then set to True during the function execution.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It checks if the smallest positive integer in list `a` is in the assigned set and updates the status of `can_form` accordingly. It also increments `m` based on certain conditions and returns the final value of `m`.**
