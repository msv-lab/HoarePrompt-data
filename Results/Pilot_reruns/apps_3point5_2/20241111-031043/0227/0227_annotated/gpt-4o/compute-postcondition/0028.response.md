Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 0, smallest positive integer in list `a` is in the assigned set. If `a[i] - x` is in the assigned set, `can_form` remains True, `m` stays 0, and the smallest positive integer in list `a` is in the assigned set. The loop is broken after this condition is met.***
