Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. Since the value of `can_form` is directly set to `False`, the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is False.
Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is False**
