According to the code, the loop can execute if both `k` and `n` are integer values from input and `k` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `seen` is an empty set does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input and `k` is greater than 0. 
State: **`n` is assigned an integer value from input, `k` is assigned an integer value from input and `k` is greater than 0, `seen` is an empty set**
