According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times starting from 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `k`, and `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should have `i` as the next integer after the last iteration. Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n`, `k`, and `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 1, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1, `i` is equal to the last `i` + 1**
