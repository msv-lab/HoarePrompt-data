According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged, unless 'No' is printed and the program exits if `remainder` is already in `seen`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **All variables remain unchanged, unless 'No' is printed and the program exits if `remainder` is already in `seen`, `i` is incremented by 1**
