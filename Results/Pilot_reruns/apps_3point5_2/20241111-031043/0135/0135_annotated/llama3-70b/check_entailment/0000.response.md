Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainders of dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if all the remainders are distinct. If a remainder is repeated, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The code annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the program and provide insight into what the code is doing at each stage. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all cases as required.
