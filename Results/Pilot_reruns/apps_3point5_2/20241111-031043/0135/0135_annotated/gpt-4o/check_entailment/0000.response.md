Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all remainders of dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The code handles the edge case where k is greater than or equal to n and returns 'No' in that scenario. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality and highlight the potential issue of division by zero, which is not a concern within the valid input range specified in the problem description.
