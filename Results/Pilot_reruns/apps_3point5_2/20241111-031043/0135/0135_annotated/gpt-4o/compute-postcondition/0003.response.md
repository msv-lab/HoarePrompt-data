According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition k is greater than or equal to n needs to be ensured to return 'No'. So, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k is less than n.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n**
