According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be equal to k. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be equal to k.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `i` is equal to k**
