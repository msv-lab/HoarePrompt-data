Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since the value of `i` is not given, we cannot calculate the exact value of `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n**
