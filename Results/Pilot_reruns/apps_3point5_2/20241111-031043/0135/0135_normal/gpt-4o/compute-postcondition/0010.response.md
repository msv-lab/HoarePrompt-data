Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated as `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the remainder. The only value we know in the initial state is that `i` is 3. The output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is the calculated remainder.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is the calculated remainder**
