Postcondition: ***`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If the `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `seen_remainders`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder`.***
