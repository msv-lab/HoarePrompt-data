According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is the calculated remainder**
