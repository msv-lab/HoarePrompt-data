According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the calculated remainder**
