According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` being an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
