The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` in the range [1, k]. If at any point a calculated remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, the loop will return 'No' and terminate. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Case_3: If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` in the range [1, k]. If at any point a calculated remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, the loop will return 'No' and terminate. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints and perform the described operations based on the values of `n` and `k`, ultimately returning 'No' or no change in variables based on the conditions met during execution.
