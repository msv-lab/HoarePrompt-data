According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop iterates through the range from 1 to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`**
