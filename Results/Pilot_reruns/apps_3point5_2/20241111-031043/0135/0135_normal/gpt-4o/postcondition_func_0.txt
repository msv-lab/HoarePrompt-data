The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function iterates through a loop where it calculates unique remainders of n divided by i for each i in the range [1, k]. If a calculated remainder is already seen, the function returns 'No' and terminates. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. The function returns 'Yes' if the loop completes successfully without encountering duplicate remainders.
