Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and if the value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.**
