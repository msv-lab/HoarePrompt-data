The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the result of a specific mathematical operation involving the integers `n` and `k`, which satisfy the constraint 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. Since there are no parameters passed into the function, it is assumed that the function will use the integers `n` and `k` as defined by the precondition. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform a mathematical operation on the integers `n` and `k` and return the result.
