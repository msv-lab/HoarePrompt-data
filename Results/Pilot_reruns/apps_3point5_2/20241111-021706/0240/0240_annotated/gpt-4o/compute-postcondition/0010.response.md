Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is the joined string of the new `perm`. The variables `chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of the new `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of the new `perm`**
