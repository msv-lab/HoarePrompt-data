According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. The loop will execute as long as `chars` contains digits and `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`. As the loop uses `permutations(chars)`, the loop will execute if `chars` has at least one digit. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `chars` is a string containing digits and `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`. 
State: **Precondition**: **chars is a string containing digits, sub is a non-empty substring of chars**.
