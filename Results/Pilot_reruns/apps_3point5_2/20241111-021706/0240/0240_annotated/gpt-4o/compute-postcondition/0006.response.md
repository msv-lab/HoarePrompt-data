Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns the value of `candidate`, which is the joined string of `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`**
