Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` is updated by adding `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
