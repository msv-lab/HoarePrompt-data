According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, and `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`. If character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is appended with `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `s`, `t`, or `t_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` should still be a non-empty string. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`**
