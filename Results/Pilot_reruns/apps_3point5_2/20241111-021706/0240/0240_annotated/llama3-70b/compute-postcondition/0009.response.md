Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to `n`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but `c` is not in `t_set`, so `n` is updated by adding `c`. The states of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` moves to the next character in the string, `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` is updated by adding `c`, `t` and `t_set` remain the same.
Output State: **`s` moves to the next character in the string, `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` is updated by adding `c`, `t` and `t_set` remain the same**
