Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`. If character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is appended with `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `s`, `t`, or `t_set`.***
