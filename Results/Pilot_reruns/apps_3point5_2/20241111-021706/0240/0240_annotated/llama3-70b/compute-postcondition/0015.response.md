The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`. Both `s` and `t` can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, if the set `t_set` is empty, it means `n` is empty. If the set `t_set` is not empty, it means `n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `s` and `t`, and based on the presence of characters from `t` in `s`, determine if `n` is empty or contains characters from `s`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two strings `s` and `t`. If the set `t_set` is empty, `n` is empty. If not, `n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set`.**
