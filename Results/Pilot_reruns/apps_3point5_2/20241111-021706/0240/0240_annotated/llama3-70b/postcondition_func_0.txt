The function func_1 accepts two strings `s` and `t`. It iterates through each character in `s` and appends it to a new string `n` if the character is present in the set `t_set` created from string `t`. Finally, it returns the integer representation of the resulting string `n`. If the set `t_set` is empty, the function returns 0.
