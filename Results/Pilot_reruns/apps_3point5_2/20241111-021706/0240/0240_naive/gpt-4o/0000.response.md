Correctness: **True**

The provided program takes in a string `s` and a substring `sub`, and then generates all possible numbers that can be formed by rearranging the characters in `s` and finally finds the smallest number that contains the substring `sub`. The logic of the program seems correct as it iterates through all permutations of the remaining characters after subtracting the characters in `sub`, checks if the substring `sub` exists in the generated number, and then finds the smallest valid number.

Additionally, the program handles cases where the input data is correct, and the answer always exists. The use of Counter to calculate the frequency of characters in `s` and `sub`, and the use of permutations to generate all possible numbers ensures that all combinations are considered.

Overall, the program seems to follow the problem description and logic correctly for all potential cases, hence the correctness is True.
