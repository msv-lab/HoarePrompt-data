Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes in the string received by Kate and the substring Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the received string and only appends the characters that are present in the remembered substring. Finally, it appends the remembered substring itself to construct the smallest possible initial integer n. The logic of the program matches the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
