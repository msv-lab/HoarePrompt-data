Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to create the smallest integer `n` by taking a string `s` and a substring `t`, then forming `n` by including only the characters in `s` that are also in `t`, and finally appending `t` to `n`. However, the code does not handle the case where there are leading zeros in the final integer `n`. 

For example, in the input "003512" with substring "021", the expected output should be "30021" to ensure no leading zeros in the final integer. But the code provided will produce an output of "3512021", which is not the smallest possible integer.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not fully comply with the problem description.
