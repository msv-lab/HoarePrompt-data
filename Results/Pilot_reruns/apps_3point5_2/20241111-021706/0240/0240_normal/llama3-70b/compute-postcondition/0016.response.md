Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two strings `s` and `t`, creates a set of unique characters from string `t`, iterates through each character in `s`, appends the character to a new string `n` only if it is in the set `t_set`, then concatenates `n` with string `t`, and finally returns an integer value of the concatenated string `n`. Potential edge cases that are missing in the annotations include scenarios where `s` is an empty string or when no characters in `s` match those in `t_set`, resulting in `n` being an empty string. It's important to note that the return statement might cause a ValueError if the concatenated `n` string cannot be converted to an integer.**
