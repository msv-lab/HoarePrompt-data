Example Answer:
The function returns `n`, which is a string concatenated with `t`. Since `n` is a string, the function returns that string as an integer. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `t`, and the function returns an integer value of `n`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `t`, and the function returns an integer value of `n`**
