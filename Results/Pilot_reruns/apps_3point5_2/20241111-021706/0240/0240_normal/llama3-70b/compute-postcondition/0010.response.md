Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string that may be updated with the next character from `s`. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, `n` is appended with `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
