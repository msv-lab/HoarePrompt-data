Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string. The loop iterates through each character in string `s`, and if the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, it is appended to the string `n`. If the character `c` is not in the set `t_set`, then no changes are made to `n`. If string `s` is empty or there are no characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`, then `n` remains an empty string.**
