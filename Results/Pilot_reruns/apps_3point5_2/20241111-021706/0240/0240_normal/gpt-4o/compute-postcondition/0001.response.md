Example Answer:
The `candidate` variable is assigned the concatenated string of the elements in `perm`. The `perm` variable is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what `candidate` will be. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n**
