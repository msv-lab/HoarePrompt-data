Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, where `perm` is a variable that represents the permutation of the digits of the number. The value of `perm` is not provided, so the exact value of `candidate` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number n, `sub` remains the same as remembered substring of n.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number n, `sub` remains the same as remembered substring of n**
