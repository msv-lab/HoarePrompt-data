Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined as a string. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`**
