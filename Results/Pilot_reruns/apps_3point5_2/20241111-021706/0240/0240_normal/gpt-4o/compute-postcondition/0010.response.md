Example Answer: 
The code snippet yields the `candidate` value. The variables `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`**
