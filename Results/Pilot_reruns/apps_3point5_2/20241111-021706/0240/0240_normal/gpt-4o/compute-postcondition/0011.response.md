Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`. If the function `is_valid_number` returns true for the `candidate`, then the function yields the `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `chars` and `sub`.***
