Output State: 
- `chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, 
- `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`. 
- If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, then the code yields the `candidate` value. 
- If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to False, there is no change in the state of the program.
- The loop will not execute if the input `chars` is an empty string. In this case, there are no changes to the values of `chars` and `sub`.
