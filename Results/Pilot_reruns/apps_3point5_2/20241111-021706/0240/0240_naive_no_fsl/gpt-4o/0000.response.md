Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes the input string and the substring that Vasya remembers, then generates all possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring. It then checks if the generated number is valid (contains the remembered substring and has the correct length) and returns the smallest valid number. The logic seems to be correct and handles all possible cases as per the problem description. The program also uses Counter to efficiently handle character frequencies and itertools permutations to generate possible numbers. Overall, the program appears to be correct.
