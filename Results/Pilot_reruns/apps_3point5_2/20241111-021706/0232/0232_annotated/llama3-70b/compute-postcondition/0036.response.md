Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting the values, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` initialized to 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, `j` starts from `i+1` and goes up to `n-1`, `color` is determined by `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.***
