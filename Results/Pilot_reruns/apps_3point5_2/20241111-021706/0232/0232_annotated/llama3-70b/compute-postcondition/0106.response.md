Output State: 
- `colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `found` is either True or False, `window_counts` contains the pairs `color: count`, `j` is equal to `i + k` where k is the number of iterations done so far, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in `colors`. If color is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 1, otherwise, the count for that color is incremented by 1. 
- If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding target counts, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. 
- If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False. 
- If `colors` is empty, the loop also does not execute, and `found` remains False.
