Postcondition: ***colors is not empty, n is greater than i, found is either True or False, window_counts contains the pairs color: 1 and color: 0, j is equal to i + 1, color is assigned the value at index j in colors. If color is not in window_counts, window_counts[color] is assigned the value 1, otherwise window_counts[color] is incremented by 1. If all counts in window_counts are equal to their corresponding target counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks.***
