Postcondition: ***`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `found` is False, `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the pair `color: 0`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in `colors`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then the pair `color: 0` is added to `window_counts`.***
