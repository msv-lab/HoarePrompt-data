Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` initialized to 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, `j` starts from `i+1` and goes up to `n-1`, `color` is determined by `colors[j]`. If the `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then it is added and initialized to 0. All other variables maintain their initial values.***
