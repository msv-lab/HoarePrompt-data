Output State: 
If `colors` is empty, the loop will not execute. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop will not execute. If `counts` is empty, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `window_counts` will be a dictionary containing the count of each color in the specified range. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` will be True.
