Postcondition: ***`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in `colors`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now assigned the value 0. After executing the code snippet, the value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in the sorted `window_counts` values match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the variable `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program has checked for a specific condition within the specified constraints and updated the necessary variables accordingly.***
