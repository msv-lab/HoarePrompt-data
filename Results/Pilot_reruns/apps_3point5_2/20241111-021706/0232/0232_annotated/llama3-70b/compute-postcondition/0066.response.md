Postcondition: ***`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then the value at key `color` is set to 0 and incremented by 1. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.***
