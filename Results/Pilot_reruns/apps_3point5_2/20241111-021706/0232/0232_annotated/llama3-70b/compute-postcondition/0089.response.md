According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than `i` and `j` is equal to `i`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is equal to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `found` is either True or False, `window_counts` contains the pairs `color: 1` and `color: 0`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in `colors`**
