Example Answer: 
A key-value pair is added to the `color_counts` dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is `0`. Since the dictionary was initially empty and `color` is not defined in the initial state, the output state is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, and `color_counts` dictionary has a key-value pair added.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` dictionary has a key-value pair added**
