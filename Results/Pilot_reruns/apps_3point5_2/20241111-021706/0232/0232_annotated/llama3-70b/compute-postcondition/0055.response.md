Example Answer:
`window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, a new entry for `color` with a value of 0 is added to `window_counts`. The values of `colors`, `n`, `i`, and `counts` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then after the execution of the if statement, `window_counts` will have an entry for `color` with a value of 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.**
