Postcondition: ***Output State: colors is not empty, n is greater than or equal to j + 1, found is True, window_counts contains the pairs color: 2 and color: 0 if color was not in window_counts initially, j is equal to i + 2, color is assigned the value at index j + 1 in colors, color is assigned the value at index i + 2 in colors. If all counts in window_counts are equal to their respective targets, found is set to True and the loop breaks.***
