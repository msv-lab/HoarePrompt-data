According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Since the initial state does not guarantee that the loop will execute, the states need to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0 and `found` is True.
State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0**
