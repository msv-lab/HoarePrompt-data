Example Answer:
`window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
