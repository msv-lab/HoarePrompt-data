Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `color` can be any integer from the `colors` list, the value of `color_counts[color]` is set to `0`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color where the specific color mentioned in the code has been set to 0.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color where the specific color mentioned in the code has been set to 0**
