Example Answer:
The value in the `colors` list at index `right` is used as a key to increment the value in `current_counts` by 1. The states of `desired_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
