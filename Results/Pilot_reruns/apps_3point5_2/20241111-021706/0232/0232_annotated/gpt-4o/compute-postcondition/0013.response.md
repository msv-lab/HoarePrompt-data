According to the code, the loop can execute again if all `current_counts` for colors are greater than or equal to their corresponding counts in `desired_counts`. If there is at least one count in `current_counts` that is less than the corresponding count in `desired_counts`, then the loop needs to execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `current_counts` where at least one count is less than the corresponding count in `desired_counts`.
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where at least one count is less than the corresponding count in `desired_counts`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
