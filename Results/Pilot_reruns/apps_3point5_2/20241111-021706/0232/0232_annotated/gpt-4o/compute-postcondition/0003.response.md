According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
- `right` should be set to 0 to start the loop.
- `desired_counts` should have mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k.
- `current_counts` should be a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `left` should be set to 0.

State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
