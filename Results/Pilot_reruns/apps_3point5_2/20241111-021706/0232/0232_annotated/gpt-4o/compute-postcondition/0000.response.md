Example Answer: 
A dictionary `desired_counts` is created by zipping the range from 1 to m with the list `k`. The dictionary will have keys from 1 to m and corresponding values from the list `k`. Since m is a positive integer, the range will be from 1 to m inclusive. The list `k` has m integers. 
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k**
