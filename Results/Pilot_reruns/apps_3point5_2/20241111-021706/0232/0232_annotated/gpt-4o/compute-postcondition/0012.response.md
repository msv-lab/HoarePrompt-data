Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where at least one count is less than the corresponding count in `desired_counts`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all current counts are equal to their corresponding desired counts for all colors in the desired counts dictionary, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
