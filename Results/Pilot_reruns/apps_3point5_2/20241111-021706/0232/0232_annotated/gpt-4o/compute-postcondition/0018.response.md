Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list is increased by 1. All other counts remain at their desired values. 
Output State: **All current counts are equal to their corresponding desired counts for all colors in the desired counts dictionary, except for the count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list which is now equal to the desired count + 1.**
