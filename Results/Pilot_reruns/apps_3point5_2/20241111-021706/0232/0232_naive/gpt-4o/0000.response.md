Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to find if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the list of Jedi Knights and checks if the current interval satisfies the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found, otherwise it returns 'NO'. 

The implementation considers all possible cases and handles the scenarios where the desired counts are met within a contiguous interval. The logic of incrementing the current counts when a new knight is added and decrementing the counts when a knight is removed from the window is correctly implemented. Overall, the program covers all the requirements mentioned in the problem description.
