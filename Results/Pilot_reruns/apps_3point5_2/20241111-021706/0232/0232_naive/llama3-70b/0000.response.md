Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in appropriate variables. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the count of lightsabers of each color matches the desired counts. If such an interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a valid interval is found, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The logic of the program seems correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
