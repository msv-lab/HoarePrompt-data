Correctness: **True**

The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It iterates through the list of colors and updates the count of each color until the desired counts are met. If the condition for all colors is met, it returns 'YES'. If the loop does not execute at all, it returns 'NO' as expected. The code also handles the constraints provided in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
