Example Answer:
The function returns the string 'YES'. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` (m > 0) and values are taken from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` (m > 0) and values are taken from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0**
