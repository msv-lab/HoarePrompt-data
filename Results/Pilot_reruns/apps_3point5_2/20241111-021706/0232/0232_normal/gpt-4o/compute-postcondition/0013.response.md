According to the code, the loop will execute as long as all the values in `current_counts` for the keys in `desired_counts` are greater than or equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are NOT equal. Therefore, the values in `current_counts` need to be adjusted so that they are greater than or equal to the values in `desired_counts` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `m` and values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and the values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are greater than or equal to the values in `desired_counts`, `n` is greater than 0**
