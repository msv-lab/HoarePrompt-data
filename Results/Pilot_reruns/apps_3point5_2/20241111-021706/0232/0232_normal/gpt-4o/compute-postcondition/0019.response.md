According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` is updated with the value of `colors[right]` increased by 1. To execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` is updated with the value of `colors[right+1]` increased by 1**
