Example Answer:
The code snippet is simply returning the string 'YES'. Since the code does not affect any variables, the state of the initial variables remains the same.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `m`, values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are NOT equal**
