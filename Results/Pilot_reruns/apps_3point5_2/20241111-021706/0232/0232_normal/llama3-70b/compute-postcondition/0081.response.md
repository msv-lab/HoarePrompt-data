In order for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'j' is equal to the new value of 'i', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is equal to 'i' and 'n' is greater than or equal to 'i'**
