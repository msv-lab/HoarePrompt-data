Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, and `found` is True.
Output State: **color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, and `found` is True**
