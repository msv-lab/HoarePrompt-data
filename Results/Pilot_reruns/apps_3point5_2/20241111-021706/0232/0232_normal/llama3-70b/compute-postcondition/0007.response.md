Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers. `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color, initially set to 0 for all colors. `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color. If the color is not already in the `color_counts` dictionary, it is added with a value of 0. After the execution of the if statement, `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. All variables maintain their initial state, with the addition of the color to the `color_counts` dictionary if it was not present before.**
