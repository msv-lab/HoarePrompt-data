Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'j' is an integer within the range of 'i' and 'n', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is a dictionary with 'color' key and value equal to 1 if 'color' is found in the current window, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is equal to the new value of 'i'. If 'color' is not in 'window_counts', 'window_counts' is updated with 'color' key and value 0. If all the counts in 'window_counts' are equal to the corresponding targets in 'counts', then 'found' is set to True and the loop breaks. If 'i' is greater than or equal to 'n' before the loop starts, the loop does not execute and 'found' remains False, 'j' is equal to 'i'.***
