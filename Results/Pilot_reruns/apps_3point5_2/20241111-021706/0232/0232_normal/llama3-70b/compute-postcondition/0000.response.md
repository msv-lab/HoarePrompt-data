Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by mapping the integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n` and `m` are now determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers**
