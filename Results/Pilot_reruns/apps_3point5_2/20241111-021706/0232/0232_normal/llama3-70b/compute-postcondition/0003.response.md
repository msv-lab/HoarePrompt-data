Example Answer: 
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
