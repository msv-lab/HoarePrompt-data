Output State: **After the loop executes, 'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color. 'found' is True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts'. 'j' is equal to 'i' if 'i' is less than 'n', otherwise 'j' is equal to 'n'. 'color' is assigned the color at index 'j' from the 'colors' list. 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary. 'window_counts' is a dictionary containing the counts of colors encountered in the loop. 'i' is incremented by 1 each iteration. If the loop does not execute (i.e., 'i' is greater than or equal to 'n' initially), the state remains the same as the initial state with no changes.**
