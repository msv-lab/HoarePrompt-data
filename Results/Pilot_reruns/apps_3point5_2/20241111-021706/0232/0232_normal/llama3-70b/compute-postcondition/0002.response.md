Example Answer:
`counts` is assigned a list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The input is expected to contain multiple integers separated by spaces. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers**
