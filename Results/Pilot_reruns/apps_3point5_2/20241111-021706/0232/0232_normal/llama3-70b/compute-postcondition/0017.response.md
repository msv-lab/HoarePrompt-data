Output State: **If there are no colors in the 'colors' list, the loop won't execute, and 'color_counts' will remain an empty dictionary. If there are colors in the 'colors' list, the loop will iterate through each color, incrementing the count for each color in the 'color_counts' dictionary. After the loop executes, 'n' and 'm' remain positive integers, 'color_counts' is a dictionary with keys for each color in the 'colors' list, and the values represent the count of each color. 'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color.**
