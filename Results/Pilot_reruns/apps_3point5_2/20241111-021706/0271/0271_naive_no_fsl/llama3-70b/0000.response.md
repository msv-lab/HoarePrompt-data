Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly rounds the given number n to the nearest integer that ends in 0. It covers all cases as described in the problem statement. If n is already divisible by 10, it prints n. If the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder. If the last digit of n is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder. This logic covers all possible scenarios, hence the program is correct.
