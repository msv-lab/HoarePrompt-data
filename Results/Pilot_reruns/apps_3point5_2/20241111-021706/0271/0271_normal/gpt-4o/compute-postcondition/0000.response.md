Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the updated value of `n` will also fall within this range after the input is provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
