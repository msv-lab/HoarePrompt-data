Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9. If remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is equal to the subtraction of `n` and `remainder`. If remainder is greater than 5, the result is equal to the addition of `n` and (10 - `remainder`).***
