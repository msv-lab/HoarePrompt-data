Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input `n` and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, then based on the value of the remainder, it calculates the `result`. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding (10 - remainder) to `n`. The code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.
