Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the remainder will be the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`**
