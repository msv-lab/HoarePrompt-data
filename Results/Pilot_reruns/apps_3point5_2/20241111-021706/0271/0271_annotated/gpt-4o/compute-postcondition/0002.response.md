Example Answer:
`remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is assigned the value `n - remainder`. The value of `result` is `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, `result` is the result of `n - remainder`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, `result` is the result of `n - remainder`**
