The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from user input, calculates the last digit of `n`, and based on whether the last digit is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, adjusts the result accordingly by subtracting or adding the difference between 10 and the last digit. The function then prints the modified result.
