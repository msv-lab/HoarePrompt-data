Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the output will be the value of `n` itself. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the value of `n` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the value of `n` is printed**
