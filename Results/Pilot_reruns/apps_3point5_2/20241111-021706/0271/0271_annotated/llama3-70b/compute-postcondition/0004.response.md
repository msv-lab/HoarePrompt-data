Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Otherwise, the program prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This accounts for all possible cases and outcomes of the if else block.***
