Functionality: **The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user input. It then checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If it is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If not, it further checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. If this condition holds true, it prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Otherwise, it prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. The function handles all possible cases of `n` within the specified range of 0 to 10^9. The function does not return any value.**
