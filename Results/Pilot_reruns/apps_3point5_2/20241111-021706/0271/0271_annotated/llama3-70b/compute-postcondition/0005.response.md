Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is 0, the program prints `n`. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Otherwise, the program prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring the correct handling of edge cases within the specified range of `n`.***
