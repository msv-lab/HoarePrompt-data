Example Answer:
The values of x, y, and z are assigned by mapping integer inputs. The values of x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Therefore, the output state is: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
