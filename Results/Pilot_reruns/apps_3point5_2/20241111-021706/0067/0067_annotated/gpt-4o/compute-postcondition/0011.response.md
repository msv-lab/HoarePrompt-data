Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from input and checks if certain conditions are met. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
