Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= y <= 100, 0 <= z <= 100. `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z. If max_downvotes < min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
