The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. Then, based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, it prints out different symbols ('+', '-', '0', or '?'). The function does not explicitly return any value and operates under the assumption that `x`, `y`, and `z` are within the range of 0 to 100. The code does not cover all potential cases as mentioned in the annotations, where specific outputs are defined based on certain conditions.
