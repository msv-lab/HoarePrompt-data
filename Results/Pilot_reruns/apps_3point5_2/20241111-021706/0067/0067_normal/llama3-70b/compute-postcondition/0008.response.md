Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x is less than y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z equals 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y but z does not equal 0, the program prints '?'. If x does not equal y, the program prints '?' while maintaining the initial state of the variables x, y, and z within the specified range of non-negative integers from 0 to 100.***
