Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input. It then calculates `min_upvotes` as `x`, `max_upvotes` as `x + z`, `min_downvotes` as `y`, and `max_downvotes` as `y + z`. Depending on the values of these variables, it prints '-' if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, '+` if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, and '?' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
