Example Answer:
max_upvotes is assigned the value of x + z, where x is the minimum upvotes value. The values of x and z are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, after execution, max_upvotes will be in the range between x and x + 100 inclusive. 
Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; min_upvotes is assigned the value of x; max_upvotes is in the range between x and x + 100 inclusive**
