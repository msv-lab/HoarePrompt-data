Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), `i` is less than the half length of the string. If any character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program accurately checks for the palindrome property, covering all possible cases and edge scenarios.**
