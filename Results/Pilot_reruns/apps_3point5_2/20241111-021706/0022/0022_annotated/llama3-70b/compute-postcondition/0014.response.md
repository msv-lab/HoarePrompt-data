Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, and `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, the variable `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This condition covers all possible cases when the if statement is executed.***
