Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True**
