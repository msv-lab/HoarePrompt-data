`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value False. The value of `is_spalindrome` is already False, so there is no change. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 2**
