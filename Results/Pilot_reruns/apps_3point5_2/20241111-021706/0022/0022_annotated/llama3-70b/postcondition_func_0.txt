Functionality: The function reads a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, calculates if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end, and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It correctly handles cases where the string is empty, contains only one letter, or has an odd length by checking the characters symmetrically.
