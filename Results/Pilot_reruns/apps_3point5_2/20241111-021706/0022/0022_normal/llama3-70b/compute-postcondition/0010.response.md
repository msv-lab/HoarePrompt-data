Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` remains at the same value, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This condition covers all cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, guaranteeing that the program handles the edge cases where the palindrome property is violated.***
