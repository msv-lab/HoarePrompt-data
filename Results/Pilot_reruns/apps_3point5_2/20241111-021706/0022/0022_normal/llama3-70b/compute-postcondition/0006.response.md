Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True initially. After the execution of the if statement, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. `i` remains 0. This covers the cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, indicating that the string `s` is not a palindrome.***
