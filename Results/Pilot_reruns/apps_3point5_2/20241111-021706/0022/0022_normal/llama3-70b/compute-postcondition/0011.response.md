According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since the loop processes characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1`, the next value of `i` should be the current `i` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
