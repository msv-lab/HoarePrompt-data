According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of string `s`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, since the loop iterates over half the length of the string, `i` should start at 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
