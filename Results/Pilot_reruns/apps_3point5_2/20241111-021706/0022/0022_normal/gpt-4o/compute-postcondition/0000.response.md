Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of string `s`, which means `n` will hold the number of characters in the string `s`. Since the length of `s` can vary from 1 to 1000, the value of `n` will also vary accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string consisting of only English letters, and |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; n is the length of string s.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of only English letters, and |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; n is the length of string s.**
