The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of only English letters. The length of the string `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000. 

The function contains two cases:
Case_1: The function checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal. If any pair of characters doesn't match, it returns False. The loop continues until it reaches the middle of the string (n // 2). If the string has an odd length, the middle character will not be compared. If the string is empty or consists of the same character throughout, the loop does not execute. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it means the string is a palindrome.

Case_2: Similar to Case_1, the function checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal and follows the same logic. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` consisting of English letters, check if it is a palindrome, and return True if it is a palindrome and False if it is not.
