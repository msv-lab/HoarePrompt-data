Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 0. If the character at index i in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
