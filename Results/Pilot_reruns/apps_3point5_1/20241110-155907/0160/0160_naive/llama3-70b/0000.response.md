Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of list A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates through all possible divisors of the gcd and finds the maximum divisor that can divide every element in A. The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem description.
