Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements in A, then finds the divisors of the sum of A, and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of A after the operations. The program iterates through the divisors in descending order and prints the first divisor that meets the condition. This logic covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
