According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Additionally, if `x` is divisible by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, then `divisors` will also contain this divisor. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x))`**
