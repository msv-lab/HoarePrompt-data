According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1. Since the loop can execute again, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. 
State: **`divisors` is an empty set initially. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` starts at 1 and ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, where `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**
