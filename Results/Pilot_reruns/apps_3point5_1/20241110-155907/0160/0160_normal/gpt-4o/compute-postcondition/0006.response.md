Example Answer:
The code snippet adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors` in each iteration of the loop. Initially, `divisors` is an empty set. Since `i` starts at 1 and ranges up to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, where `x` is a positive integer, the loop will add values from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) to the set `divisors`. After the loop finishes, `divisors` will contain all the divisors of `x` up to its square root.
Output State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root**
