Example Answer:
The code adds the value `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The initial state specifies that `divisors` contains only 1, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. After executing the code, the value of `x // i` will be added to the set `divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains {1, x//1}.
Output State: **`divisors` is {1, x}**
