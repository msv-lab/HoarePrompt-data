Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1 and `divisors` is initially an empty set, after execution, `divisors` will contain the value 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is {1}, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1 is not empty.
Output State: **`divisors` is {1}, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1 is not empty**
