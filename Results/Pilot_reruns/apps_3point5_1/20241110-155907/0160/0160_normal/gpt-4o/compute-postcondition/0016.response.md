The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` must be an integer. The function calculates all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))` if applicable. The divisors are then sorted in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return a list containing all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))` if applicable, sorted in reverse order.
