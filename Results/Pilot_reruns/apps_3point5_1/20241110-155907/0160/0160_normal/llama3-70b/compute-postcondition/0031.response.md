Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `N` and `K`, then reads a list `A` of integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all integers in list `A`, assigns it to `max_divisor`, and then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. Finally, it prints the `max_divisor`. The function does not accept any parameters, and it operates based on the input constraints and relationships provided. **
