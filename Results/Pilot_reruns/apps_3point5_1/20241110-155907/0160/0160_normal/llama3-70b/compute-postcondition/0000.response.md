Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values using map(int, input().split()), which means that N and K are integers taken as input separated by a space. The values of N and K are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for i from 1 to N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for i from 1 to N**
