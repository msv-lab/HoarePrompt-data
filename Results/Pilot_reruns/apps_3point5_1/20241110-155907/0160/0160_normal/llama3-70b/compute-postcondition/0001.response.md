Example Answer:
The list A is assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input by spaces. The input is expected to contain N integers. The values in the list A range from 1 to 10^6. Therefore, after execution, the list A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6.
Output State: **List A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6**
