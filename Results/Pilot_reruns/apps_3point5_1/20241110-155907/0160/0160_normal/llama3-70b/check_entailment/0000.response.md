Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for `N` and `K`, then reads a list `A` of integers as described in the problem description.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all integers in list `A` and assigns it to `max_divisor`, which is in line with the problem description.
- It then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd, which is the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.
- The code handles the constraints on the input values for `N`, `K`, and `A` correctly.
- The output hints agree with the code in terms of its functionality and the logic followed to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A`.
