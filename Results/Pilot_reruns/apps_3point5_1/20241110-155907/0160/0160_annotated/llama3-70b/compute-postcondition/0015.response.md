Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and gcd // i.***
