According to the code, the loop can execute if `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. So, in order for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1**
