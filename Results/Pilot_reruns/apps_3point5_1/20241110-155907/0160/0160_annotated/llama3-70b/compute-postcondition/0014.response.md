Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, and `gcd // i` is a mathematical operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1.
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1**
