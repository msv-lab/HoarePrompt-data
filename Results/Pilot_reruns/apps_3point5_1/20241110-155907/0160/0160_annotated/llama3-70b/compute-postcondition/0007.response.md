According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list containing integers obtained from input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and `A[i]`, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 3.
State: **N is between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a non-empty list containing integers obtained from input, gcd is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and A[i], i is 3**
