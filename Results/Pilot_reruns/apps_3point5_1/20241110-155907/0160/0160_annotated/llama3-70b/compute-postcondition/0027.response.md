According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is 2 or greater, `K` is any integer, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, and the loop has been executed up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the loop condition `i < math.sqrt(gcd)` must still hold true. Since the loop is starting from 1, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, i is incremented by 1, and i is still less than the square root of gcd**
