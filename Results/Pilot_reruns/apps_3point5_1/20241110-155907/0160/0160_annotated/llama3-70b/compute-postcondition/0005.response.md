According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list containing integers obtained from input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and A[i], and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 2.
State: **N is between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a non-empty list containing integers obtained from input, gcd is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and A[i], i is 2**
