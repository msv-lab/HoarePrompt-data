Example Answer:
`divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, and `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`. The code snippet adds the result of `x // i` to the `divisors` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, and `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`**
