Example Answer: 
The value `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The variable `i` ranges from 1 to the square root of `x`, so multiple values may be added to `divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`**
