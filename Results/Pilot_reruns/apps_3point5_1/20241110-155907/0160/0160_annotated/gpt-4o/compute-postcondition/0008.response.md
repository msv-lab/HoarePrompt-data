Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`. If `x % i == 0`, then `divisors` is updated by adding both `i` and `x // i` to it, where `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1. All edge cases related to the division of `x` by `i` are handled, ensuring the correctness of the divisors in the set.***
