According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`, where `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current value of `i`. Additionally, if `x` is divisible by the current `i`, then `divisors` should be updated to include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by the current `i`, no changes are made to `divisors`.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`, where `i` is the next integer after the current square root of `x`, based on the divisibility of `x` by the current `i`.**
