Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` already contains at least one divisor of `x`, and `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`. After adding `i` to the set, the set `divisors` now contains more divisors of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`**
