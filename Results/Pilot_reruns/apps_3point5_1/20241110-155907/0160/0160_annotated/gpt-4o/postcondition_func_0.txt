The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function updates the `gcd_result` variable to the new greatest common divisor. If the list has only one element, `gcd_result` remains the same as the initial value at index 0 of `lst`.
