Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes, calculates the minimum wait time based on specific conditions, selects the route with the minimum wait time, and returns the index of the chosen route plus 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, resulting in `min_wait_time` remaining positive infinity and `chosen_route` staying as -1. The function handles scenarios where the time conditions for wait time calculation are met and covers edge cases related to bus route selection and wait time calculation.**
