Output State: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated, chosen_route is set to i + 2, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes, s_i, d_i are assigned the values of the next tuple in bus_routes, and wait_time is calculated as s_i - t.
