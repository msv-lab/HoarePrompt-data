Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. After the execution of the if-else block, min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time calculated. If wait_time is less than min_wait_time, min_wait_time is assigned the value of wait_time, chosen_route is set to i + 1, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, and d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the wait time calculation in the bus route scenario.***
