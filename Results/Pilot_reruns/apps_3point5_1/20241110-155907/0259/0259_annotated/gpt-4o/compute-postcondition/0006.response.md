Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The value of `d_i` is the destination of the first tuple, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` is the source of the first tuple. The calculation involves modulo operation and subtraction. The output state is not specified for other variables, so the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple, and wait_time is the calculated value.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple, and wait_time is the calculated value**
