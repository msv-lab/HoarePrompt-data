Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first tuple in the list `bus_routes`. The value of `i` is 0, so `s_i` and `d_i` will be the values of the first tuple in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple**
