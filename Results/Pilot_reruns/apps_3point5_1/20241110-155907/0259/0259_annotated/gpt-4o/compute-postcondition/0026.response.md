Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the next tuple in `bus_routes`. The value of `t` is used in the calculation. Other variables are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is set to i + 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `s_i` is the source of the next tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the destination of the next tuple in `bus_routes`, and `s_i, d_i` are assigned the values of the next tuple in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula mentioned.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated, chosen_route is set to i + 2, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes, and s_i, d_i are assigned the values of the next tuple in bus_routes, and wait_time is calculated based on the given formula.**
