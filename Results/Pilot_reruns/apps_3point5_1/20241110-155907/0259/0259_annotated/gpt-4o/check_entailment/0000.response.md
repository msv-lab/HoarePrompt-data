Correctness: True

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is clear that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the specified conditions and selects the route with the minimum wait time for Serval. The annotations provided also align with the logic of the code, covering scenarios where the time conditions for wait time calculation are met and handling edge cases related to bus route selection. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are valid and the code produces the correct output for each of them. Hence, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
