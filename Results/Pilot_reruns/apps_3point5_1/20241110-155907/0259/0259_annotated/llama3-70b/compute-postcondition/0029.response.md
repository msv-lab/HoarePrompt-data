Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the index of the minimum time value plus 1, `i` is 2, `s` and `d` are the values extracted from the third element of the buses list. If time is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, `ans` is set to 3, `i` remains 2, `s` and `d` retain their original values.***
