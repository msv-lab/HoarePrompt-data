Example Answer:
The variable `min_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The loop is supposed to read `n` pairs of integers entered by the user and append them as tuples to the `buses` list. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. Since no input is taken in this simulation, we can only determine that `min_time` is positive infinity.
Output State: **`min_time` is positive infinity**
