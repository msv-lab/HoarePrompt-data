Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the index of the minimum time value plus 1, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are the values extracted from the second element of the buses list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new time value, and `ans` is set to the index of the new minimum time plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `min_time` and `ans`.***
