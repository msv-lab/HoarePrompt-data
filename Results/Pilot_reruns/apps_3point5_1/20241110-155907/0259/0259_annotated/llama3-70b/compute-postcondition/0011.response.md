According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the next positive integer within the range of 2 to 100. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to the next positive integer within the range of 3 to 100. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is the next positive integer within the range of 3 to 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples of `(s, d)` entered by the user**
