According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to the next positive integer within the range. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is the next positive integer within the range of 2 to 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains two tuples**
