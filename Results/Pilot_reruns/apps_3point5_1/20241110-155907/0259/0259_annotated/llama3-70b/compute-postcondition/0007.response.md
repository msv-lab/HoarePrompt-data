Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input split into integers. Since `buses` initially contained one tuple, after this operation, it will contain two tuples. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains two tuples.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains two tuples**
