Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values by splitting the input. As the input values are unknown, the output state will be: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5**
