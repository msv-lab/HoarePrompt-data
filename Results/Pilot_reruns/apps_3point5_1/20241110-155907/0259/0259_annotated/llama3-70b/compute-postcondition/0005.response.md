According to the code, the loop will execute n times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`**
