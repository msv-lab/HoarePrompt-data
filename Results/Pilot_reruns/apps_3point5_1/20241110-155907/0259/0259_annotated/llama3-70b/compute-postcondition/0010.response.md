Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is created based on the user input values `s` and `d`, and this tuple is appended to the `buses` list. The variables `s` and `d` will hold values entered by the user. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the next positive integer within the range of 2 to 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples of `(s, d)` entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is the next positive integer within the range of 2 to 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples of `(s, d)` entered by the user**
