Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated for all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity while `chosen_route` remains -1. If the loop executes, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The variables are updated accordingly within the loop to maintain the integrity of the initial state.**
