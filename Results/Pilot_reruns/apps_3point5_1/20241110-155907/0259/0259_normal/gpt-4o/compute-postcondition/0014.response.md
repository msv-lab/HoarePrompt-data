Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The variables `s_i` and `t` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
