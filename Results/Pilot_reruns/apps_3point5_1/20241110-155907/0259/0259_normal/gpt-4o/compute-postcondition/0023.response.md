Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. The previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` are unknown, so after execution, `s_i` and `d_i` will take on the values from `bus_routes[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is the updated minimum of all `wait_time` values encountered, `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the updated minimum `wait_time` route, `n` remains greater than 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the updated minimum of all `wait_time` values encountered, `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the updated minimum `wait_time` route, `n` remains greater than 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration**
