Example Answer:
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity while `chosen_route` remains -1. If the loop executes, the loop iterates through `bus_routes`, updating `s_i` and `d_i` accordingly and calculating `wait_time` based on conditions specified in the loop code. Finally, the function returns the value of `chosen_route`.
Output State: **If `n` is less than or equal to 0, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1. Otherwise, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` have been updated based on the loop execution. The function returns the value of `chosen_route`.**
