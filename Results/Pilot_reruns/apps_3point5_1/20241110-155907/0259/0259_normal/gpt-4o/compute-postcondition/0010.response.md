Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is a positive integer. The value of `chosen_route` is now incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the new value of `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the new value of `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
