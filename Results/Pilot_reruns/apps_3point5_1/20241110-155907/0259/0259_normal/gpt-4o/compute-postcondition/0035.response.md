The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers: `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route respectively.

After executing the function body, if `n` is less than or equal to 0, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1. Otherwise, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` have been updated based on the loop execution. The function returns the value of `chosen_route`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the bus routes data. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route, updates the relevant variables, and returns the chosen route based on the calculations. If the number of bus routes is less than or equal to 0, it sets `min_wait_time` to positive infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
