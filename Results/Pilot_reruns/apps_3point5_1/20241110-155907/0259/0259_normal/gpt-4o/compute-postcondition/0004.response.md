Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
