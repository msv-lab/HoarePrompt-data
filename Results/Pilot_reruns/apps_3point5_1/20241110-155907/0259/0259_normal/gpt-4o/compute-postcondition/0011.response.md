Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If s_i >= t, `wait_time` is set to s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. After the if-else block executes, `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to the new value of `i + 1`. All initial conditions and edge cases are considered to ensure the correctness of the program variables.***
