Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is the updated minimum of all `wait_time` values encountered, `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the updated minimum `wait_time` route, `n` remains greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` based on the given formula.***
