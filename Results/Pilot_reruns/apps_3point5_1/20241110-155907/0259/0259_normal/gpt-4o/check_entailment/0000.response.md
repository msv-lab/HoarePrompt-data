Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. The code correctly handles the conditions where Serval arrives before the first bus of a route, when the wait time is zero, and when it is necessary to calculate the remaining wait time until the next bus arrives. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code's functionality, further confirming its correctness.
