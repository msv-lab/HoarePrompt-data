Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from splitting the input. The input is split into two integers representing the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station**
