Example Answer: 
The code is splitting the input into two integers `s` and `d` using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of the affected variables are n, t, and buses. After execution, the values of `s` and `d` are updated based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
