According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, ans is -1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the buses list must have at least 1 element, and i is 0, s and d are the values of the first tuple in the buses list.
State: **`ans` is -1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the buses list**
