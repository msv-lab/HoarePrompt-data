Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the `buses` list. `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. This ensures that after the if-else block executes, the program maintains the initial state with the updated values of `min_time` and `ans`, while other variables remain unchanged.***
