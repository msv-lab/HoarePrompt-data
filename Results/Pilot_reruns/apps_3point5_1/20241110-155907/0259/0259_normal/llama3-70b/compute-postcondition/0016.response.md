Example Answer:
The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `t` is not defined in the initial state. The initial values of `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the `buses` list. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the `buses` list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.
Output State: **`ans` is -1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the `buses` list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`**
