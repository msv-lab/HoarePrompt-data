Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list buses. The previous values of n, t, and the contents of buses are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer + 1, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is a positive integer + 1, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
