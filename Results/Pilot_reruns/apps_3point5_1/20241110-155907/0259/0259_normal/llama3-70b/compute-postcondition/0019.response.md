Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. In all cases, `ans` is 1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the `buses` list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.***
