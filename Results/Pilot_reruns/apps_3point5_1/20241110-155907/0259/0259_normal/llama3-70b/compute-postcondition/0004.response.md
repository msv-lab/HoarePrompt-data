Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list buses. The values of s and d are determined by input, so the exact values are unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, and the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, and the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
