The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates a multiplier based on the value of `k`, which can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Then, it multiplies `n` by the calculated multiplier and returns the result as `x`.
