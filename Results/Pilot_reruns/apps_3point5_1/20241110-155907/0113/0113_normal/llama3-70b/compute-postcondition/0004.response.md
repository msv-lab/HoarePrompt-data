Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` is `k + 1`, so after execution, `k` is further incremented by 1. As `k` is incremented, the value of `x` changes to the power of 10 based on the new value of `k`. Since `n % x != 0` condition holds true, the new value of `x` is still a power of 10 different from `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the incremented positive integer, `k` is `k + 2`, and `x` is a power of 10 based on the new value of `k` such that `n % x != 0`.
Output State: **`n` is the incremented positive integer, `k` is `k + 2`, and `x` is a power of 10 based on the new value of `k` such that `n % x != 0`**
