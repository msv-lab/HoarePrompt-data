Example Answer:
`n` is incremented by 1. As the initial value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, after the increment, `n` will be a positive integer between 2 and 10^9. The variables `k` and `x` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a power of 10 based on the value of `k`**
