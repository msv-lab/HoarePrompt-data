Output State: **if n is divisible by x the loop will not execute and n, k, x will remain the same. if n is not divisible by x, then n is the smallest positive integer greater than the initial n that is divisible by x, k is increased by multiples of 2 until n is divisible by x again, x is updated accordingly based on the new value of k.**
