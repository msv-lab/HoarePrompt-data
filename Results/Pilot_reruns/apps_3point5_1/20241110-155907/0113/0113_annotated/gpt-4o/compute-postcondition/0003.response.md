The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the function returns a positive integer `multiplier` ranging from 1 to 100,000,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return a positive integer `multiplier` within the specified range.
