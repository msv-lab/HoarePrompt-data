Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. Since the initial state specifies that `multiplier` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000,000, and `n` is not given, the specific calculation result cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000,000.
Output State: **`multiplier` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000,000**
