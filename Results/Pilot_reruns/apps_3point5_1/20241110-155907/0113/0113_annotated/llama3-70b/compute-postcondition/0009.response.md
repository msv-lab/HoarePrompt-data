Example Answer: 
The code prints the value of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `x`, the loop will execute and increase `n` until `n` is divisible by `x`. The final state will have `x` as a positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, `n` as the smallest multiple of `x` greater than the initial `n`, and `k` as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, the values of `x`, `n`, and `k` will remain the same as the initial state.
Output State: **output state**
