According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. If `n % x` does not equal 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is increased by 1. The value of `x` is not given, so it remains the same. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is a different positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, n is increased by 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
