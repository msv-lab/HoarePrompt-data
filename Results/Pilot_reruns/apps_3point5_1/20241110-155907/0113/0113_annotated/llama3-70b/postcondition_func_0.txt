The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input. It calculates the smallest multiple of 10 to the power of `k` greater than or equal to `n` and prints this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to find the smallest multiple of 10 to the power of `k` that is greater than or equal to `n` and output this value.
