Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input, calculates the multiplier (10^k), then calculates the k-rounding of n using the formula provided in the problem description. It then prints the k-rounding of n. The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and work correctly for all possible inputs. The program handles the case where k is 0 (no trailing zeros) by simply returning the original number n. Thus, the program is correct.
