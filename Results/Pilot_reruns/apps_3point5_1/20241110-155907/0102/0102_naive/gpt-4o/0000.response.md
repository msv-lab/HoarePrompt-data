Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the input is zero. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the input can be between 0 and 99, and for the input 0, the program should return "zero". However, in the current implementation, the program does not have a condition to handle the case when the input is 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
