Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly converts a given integer score into its corresponding English representation as described in the problem description. It handles cases where the score is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and greater than or equal to 20. The code uses predefined arrays `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` to construct the English word representation of the score. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code would fail to produce the correct output. The output hints also confirm that the code follows the problem description accurately.
