Example Answer:
The list `teens` is assigned a list of strings representing the names of numbers in the teens. The variables `s` and `ones` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged**
