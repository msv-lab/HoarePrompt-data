Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the combination of the tens and ones place of the input integer `s`. The value of `s` is used to index the `tens` list to get the corresponding string for the tens place. If the ones place is not 0, a hyphen and the corresponding string for the ones place from the `ones` list are appended. The output state is `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged**
