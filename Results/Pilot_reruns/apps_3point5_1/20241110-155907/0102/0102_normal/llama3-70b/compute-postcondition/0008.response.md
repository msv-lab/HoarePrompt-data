Postcondition: ***s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged. If s < 10, the program prints the corresponding value from the ones array. If s is between 10 and 19, the program prints the corresponding value from the teens array. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the concatenation of the corresponding value from the tens array with the value from the ones array separated by a hyphen if s is not a multiple of 10. All possible cases are covered, ensuring the correct output for any valid input s.***
