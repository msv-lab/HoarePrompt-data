Example Answer:
The list `ones` is assigned with a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine. The variable `ones` is the only affected variable, and its value is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']. Therefore, the Output State is: ones is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **ones is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine**
