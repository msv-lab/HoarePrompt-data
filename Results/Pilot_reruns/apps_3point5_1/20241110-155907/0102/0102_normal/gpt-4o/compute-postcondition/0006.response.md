Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representation of the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen. The value of `n` is used to index the `tens` and `ones` lists to get the corresponding strings. 
Output State: **`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety, and the function returns the concatenated string representation of the number `n`.**
