Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. This postcondition covers all edge cases including when n is any integer.***
