The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and returns different string representations based on the value of `n`:
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, it concatenates the `tens` value at index n // 10 with a hyphen followed by the `ones` value at index n % 10.
The function covers all possible scenarios for the input integer `n` within the specified range.
