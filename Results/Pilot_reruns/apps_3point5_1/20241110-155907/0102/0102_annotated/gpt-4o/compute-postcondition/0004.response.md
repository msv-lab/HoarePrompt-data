Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n - 10` from the list `teens`. Since `n` ranges from 0 to 99, the values of `n - 10` will range from -10 to 89. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, and the function returns the value at the index `n - 10` from the list `teens`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, and the function returns the value at the index `n - 10` from the list `teens`**
