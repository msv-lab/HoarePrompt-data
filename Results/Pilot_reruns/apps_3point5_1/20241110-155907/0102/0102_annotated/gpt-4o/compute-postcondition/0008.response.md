Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the value at the index n // 10 in the `tens` list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the value at index n // 10 in the `tens` list with a hyphen followed by the value at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. This covers all possible scenarios for the input integer `n` within the specified range.***
