The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. After executing the function body, the function follows different scenarios based on the value of `n`:
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the value at index `n` in the `ones` list.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the value at index `n - 10` in the `teens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the value at index n // 10 in the `tens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the value at index n // 10 in the `tens` list with a hyphen followed by the value at index n % 10 in the `ones` list.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return different values based on the specified conditions for different ranges of `n`.
