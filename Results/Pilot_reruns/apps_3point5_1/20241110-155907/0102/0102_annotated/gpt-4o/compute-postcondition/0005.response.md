Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `n` ranges from 0 to 99, `n // 10` will range from 0 to 9. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and the function returns the value at the corresponding index in the `tens` list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and the function returns the value at the corresponding index in the `tens` list**
