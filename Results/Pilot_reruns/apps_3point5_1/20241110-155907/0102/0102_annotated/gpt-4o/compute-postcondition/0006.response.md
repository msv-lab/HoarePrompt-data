Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the string at index n // 10 from the `tens` list, a hyphen '-', and the string at index n % 10 from the `ones` list. The value of `n` is used to access elements from the `tens` and `ones` lists. Since `n` ranges from 0 to 99, the output will vary based on the values in the `tens` and `ones` lists. 
Output State: **The output will be based on the values stored in the `tens` and `ones` lists for the given integer `n`.**
