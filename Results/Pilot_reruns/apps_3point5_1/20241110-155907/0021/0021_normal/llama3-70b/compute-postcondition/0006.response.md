Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a` and compares it with the distance between the last element and the nearest occurrence of 1 in list `a`. The output state will depend on the initial values of `max_dist` and `min_dist`. `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`, and `n - 1 - min_dist` calculates the distance between the last element and the nearest occurrence of 1 in list `a`. The final result will be the maximum of these two distances.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`, and the code prints the maximum of max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist**
