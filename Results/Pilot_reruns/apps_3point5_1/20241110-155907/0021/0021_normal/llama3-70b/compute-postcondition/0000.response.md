Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that n is an integer between 2 and 100, the value of `n` after input will also be an integer between 2 and 100. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)**
