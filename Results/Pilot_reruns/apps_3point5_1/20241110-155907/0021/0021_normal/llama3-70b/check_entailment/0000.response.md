Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The code calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements by considering the positions of 1 and n in the input list. However, the code does not handle a situation where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the list, and swapping them would not increase the distance. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
The code would output `5` as the maximum distance, but the actual maximum distance in this case is `5` and not `6` as the code suggests. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
