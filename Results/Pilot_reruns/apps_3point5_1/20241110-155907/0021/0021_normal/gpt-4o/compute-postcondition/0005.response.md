Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, where `n` is an input integer and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. The previous values of `n` and `max_pos` are known, so we can calculate `dist2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`**
