Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. The previous values of variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`**
