Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The output hints mention that the function calculates the maximum absolute difference between 0 and the index of the minimum and maximum values in the list, and between `n - 1` and the index of the minimum and maximum values. However, the code does not correctly determine the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
The code will output 5, but the correct output should be 4. One swap can be made between 6 and 1 to achieve the maximum distance of 4 between the minimum and maximum elements. This edge case demonstrates that the code is incorrect.
