Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It handles the edge cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array and adjusts the distance accordingly. The logic of finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculating the distances, and outputting the maximum distance is implemented correctly. The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
