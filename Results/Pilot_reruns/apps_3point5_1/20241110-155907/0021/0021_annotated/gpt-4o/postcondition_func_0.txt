The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of 1 and `n` from the edges of the list `a` and prints this maximum distance. The function does not return any specific output, only prints the maximum distance.
