Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an input of a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`, then calculates the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (`n`) after performing exactly one swap. It correctly finds the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, calculates the distances from the edges, and prints the maximum distance. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it maximizes the distance between the minimum and maximum elements with exactly one swap. The annotations provide a clear breakdown of the code logic, which aligns with the problem requirements.
