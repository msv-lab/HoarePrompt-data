Example Answer:
dist1 is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, where max_pos is n-1. Since max_pos is n-1, then dist1 is abs(0 - (n-1)) = abs(0 - n + 1) = abs(n - 1). Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1).
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1)**
