Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered through input after converting them to integers using the `map` and `int` functions. The length of the list `a` is `n`, and each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive).
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)**
