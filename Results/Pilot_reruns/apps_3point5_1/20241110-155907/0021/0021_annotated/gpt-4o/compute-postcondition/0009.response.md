Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(max_distance)` will output the value of `max_distance`, which is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The initial values are n as an input integer, a as a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos as the index of 1 in list a, max_pos as n-1, dist1 as the absolute difference between n and 1, dist2 as 0, dist3 as the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, dist4 as the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, and max_distance as the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 is the absolute difference between n and 1, dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, max_distance is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 is the absolute difference between n and 1, dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, max_distance is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4**
