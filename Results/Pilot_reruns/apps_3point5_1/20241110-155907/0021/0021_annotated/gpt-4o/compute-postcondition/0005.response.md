Example Answer:
dist2 is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, where max_pos is n-1. Since n is an input integer and max_pos is n-1, dist2 = abs(n - 1 - (n - 1)) = abs(0) = 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0**
