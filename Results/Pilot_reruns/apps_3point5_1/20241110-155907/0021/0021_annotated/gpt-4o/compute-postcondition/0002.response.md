Example Answer:
The index of the number 1 in the list `a` is found and assigned to `min_pos`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n, and 1 is included in the list, `min_pos` will be the index of 1 in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a**
