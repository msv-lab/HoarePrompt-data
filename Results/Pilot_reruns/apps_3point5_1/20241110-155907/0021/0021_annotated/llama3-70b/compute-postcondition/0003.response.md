Example Answer:
The code attempts to find the index of the input integer `n` in the list `a`. If `n` is present in the list, `posn` will be assigned the index of `n`. If `n` is not in the list, a ValueError will be raised. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised**
