Example Answer: 
`min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` subtracted by 1 and `n` minus 2. The value of `pos1` represents the index of 1 in list `a`. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance, `min_dist` is the calculated minimum distance.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance, `min_dist` is the calculated minimum distance**
