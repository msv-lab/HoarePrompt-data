Example Answer:
The maximum distance `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The value of `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised, and `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance**
