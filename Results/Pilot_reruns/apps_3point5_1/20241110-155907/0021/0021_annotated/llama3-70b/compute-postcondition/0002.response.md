Example Answer:
`pos1` is assigned the index of the value 1 in list `a`. The variable `a` is a list of integers, and `n` is an input integer. The value 1 may or may not be present in list `a`, so `pos1` will be the index of 1 if it exists, otherwise, it will raise a ValueError. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `pos1` is either the index of 1 in list `a` or a ValueError is raised**
