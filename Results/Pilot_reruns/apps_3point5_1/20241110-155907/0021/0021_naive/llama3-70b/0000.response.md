Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the array by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum distance by taking the maximum of the absolute difference between the positions of the minimum and maximum elements minus 1 and n-2. The code also calculates the minimum distance by taking the minimum of the same values. Finally, it prints the maximum of the maximum distance and n-1 minus the minimum distance, which gives the correct output as per the problem description.

The code handles all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.
