Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values. It then checks for the conditions mentioned in the problem description to determine the result. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints "-", if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints "+", otherwise it prints "?". This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
