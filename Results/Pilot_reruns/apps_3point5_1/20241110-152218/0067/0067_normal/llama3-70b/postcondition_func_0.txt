Functionality: The function reads three integers from user input and then compares them as follows:
- If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'
- If x is less than y, it prints '-'
- If x is equal to y, it further checks if z is 0 and prints '0' or prints '?' if z is not 0
- If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'
The function essentially performs comparison operations based on the input integers x, y, and z, and outputs specific characters accordingly.
