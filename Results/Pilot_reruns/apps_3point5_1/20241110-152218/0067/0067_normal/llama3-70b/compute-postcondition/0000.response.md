Example Answer:
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input split by space. The input is expected to contain three integers. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated accordingly based on the input. Since the initial state of `x`, `y`, and `z` is not specified, the output state will reflect the values entered by the user.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the user input**
