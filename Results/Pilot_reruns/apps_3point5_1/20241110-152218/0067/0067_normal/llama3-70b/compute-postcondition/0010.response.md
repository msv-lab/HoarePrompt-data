The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of the squares of the non-negative integers x, y, and z. The precondition specifies that x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of the squares of x, y, and z, where x, y, and z are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of the squares of non-negative integers x, y, and z, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.**
