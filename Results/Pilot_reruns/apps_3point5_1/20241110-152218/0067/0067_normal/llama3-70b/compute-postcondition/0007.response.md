Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the user input. If `x` is equal to `y`, then depending on the value of `z`, the program either prints '0' or '?'. If `z` is 0, the program prints '0' and updates `x`, `y`, and `z` based on user input. If `z` is not equal to 0, the program prints '?' and updates `x`, `y`, and `z` based on user input. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the program prints '?' and updates `x`, `y`, and `z` based on user input.***
