Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are variables updated based on user input. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the program prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the program prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the program prints '0'; if `z` is not 0, the program prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints '?'. In all cases, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on user input.***
