Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer. Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, the value of `min_upvotes` is within this range. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer within the same range as `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer within the same range as `x`**
