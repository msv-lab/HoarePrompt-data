Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes three integers as input representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown. It then calculates the minimum possible upvotes, maximum possible upvotes, minimum possible downvotes, and maximum possible downvotes based on the input values. Finally, it prints the result based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

The code correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description:
1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes, it prints "-".
2. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, it prints "+".
3. If there are an equal number of upvotes and downvotes, it prints "0".
4. If there are multiple possible results due to the unknown votes, it prints "?".

The annotations also align with the code logic and explain the purpose of each step in the program. Since the code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and the annotations provide a clear explanation of the code flow, the correctness of the code can be deemed as true.
