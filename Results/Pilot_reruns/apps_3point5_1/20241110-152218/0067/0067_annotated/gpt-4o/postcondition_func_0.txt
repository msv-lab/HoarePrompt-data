Functionality: The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input and then determines the appropriate output based on the following conditions:
- If `max_upvotes` (calculated as the sum of `x` and `z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (value of `y`), it prints '-'.
- If `max_downvotes` (calculated as the sum of `y` and `z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (value of `x`), it prints '+'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'.

Note: The function does not return any value directly, it only prints the output based on the conditions mentioned above.
