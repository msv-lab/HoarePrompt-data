Example Answer: 
The length of string `s` is calculated by `len(s)` and assigned to `n`. Since `s` has a length between 1 and 1000 consisting only of English letters, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
