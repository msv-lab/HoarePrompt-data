According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 2**
