Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It checks if the input string is a symmetric palindrome by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing characters from the beginning and end. If the characters do not match, it sets `is_spalindrome` to False. The code then prints 'TAK' if the string is a symmetric palindrome, and 'NIE' otherwise. The annotations provide a clear explanation of how the code works and the logic behind it. The code handles all cases where the input string is not a symmetric palindrome as per the problem description.
