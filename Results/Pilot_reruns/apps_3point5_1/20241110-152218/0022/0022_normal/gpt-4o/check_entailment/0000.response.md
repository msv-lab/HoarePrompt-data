Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing characters at symmetric positions. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns False. If all character pairs are equal, the function returns True. Additionally, the code handles the edge case of a string with a length less than 2 by not executing the loop. The logic is aligned with the problem description, and there are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
