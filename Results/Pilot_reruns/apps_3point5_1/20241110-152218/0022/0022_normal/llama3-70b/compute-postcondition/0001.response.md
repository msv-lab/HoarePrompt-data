Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is calculated and assigned to `n`. The value of `s` is provided by the user, so the length of `s` could be any non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`**
