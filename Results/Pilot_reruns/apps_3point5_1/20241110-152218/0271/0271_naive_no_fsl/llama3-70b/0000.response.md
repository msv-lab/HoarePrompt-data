Correctness: True

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the given number `n` ends with 0, in which case it prints `n` as the rounded number. If `n` does not end with 0, it calculates the nearest integer that ends with 0 by subtracting or adding the remainder from the division by 10 appropriately. The logic provided covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct rounded number.
