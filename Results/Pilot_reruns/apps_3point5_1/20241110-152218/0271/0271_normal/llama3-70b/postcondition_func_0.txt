The function reads an integer n from the user and prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of n. If n is a multiple of 10, it prints n. If n is less than or equal to 5 modulo 10, it prints the rounded down value to the nearest multiple of 10. If n is greater than 5 modulo 10, it prints the rounded up value to the next multiple of 10 greater than n. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
