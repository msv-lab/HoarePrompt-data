Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is a non-negative integer. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n` minus `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n` plus (10 - `remainder`).**
