Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can range from 0 to 10^9 based on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
