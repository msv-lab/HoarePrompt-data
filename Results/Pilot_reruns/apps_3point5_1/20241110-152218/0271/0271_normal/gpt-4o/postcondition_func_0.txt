The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, then determines `result` based on the value of this remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is calculated as `n` minus the remainder; otherwise, `result` is `n` plus (10 - remainder). Finally, the function prints the calculated result. The function does not explicitly return a value.
