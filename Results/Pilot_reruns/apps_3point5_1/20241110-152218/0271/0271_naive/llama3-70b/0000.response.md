Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by rounding the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If the number already ends with 0, it is considered already rounded. The program checks if the last digit of the number is 0, if it is, then it prints the number as is. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down the number to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up the number to the nearest multiple of 10. This logic covers all possible cases and correctly implements the rounding behavior described in the problem statement.
