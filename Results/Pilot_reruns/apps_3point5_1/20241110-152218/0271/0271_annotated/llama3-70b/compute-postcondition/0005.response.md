Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 is equal to 0, the program prints n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints a multiple of 10 obtained by subtracting the remainder from n. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the program prints n incremented by the difference between 10 and the remainder. This postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios and ensures the correct output based on the conditions specified for n.***
