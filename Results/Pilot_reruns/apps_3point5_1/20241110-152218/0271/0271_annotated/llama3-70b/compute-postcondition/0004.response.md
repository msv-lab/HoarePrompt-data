Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the result is a multiple of 10 given by n - n % 10. Otherwise, if n % 10 is greater than 5, the result is n + (10 - n % 10). This covers all possible scenarios for the program fragment, ensuring that the output meets the specified conditions for n.***
