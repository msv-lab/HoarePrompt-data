Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is obtained by subtracting `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is obtained by adding `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`. The result is printed.**
