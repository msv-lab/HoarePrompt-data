Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated by adding `n` with the difference between 10 and `remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9, the value of `result` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`**
