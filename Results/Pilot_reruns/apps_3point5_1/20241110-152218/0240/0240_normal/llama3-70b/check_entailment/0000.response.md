Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not handle the case where the input string `s` has leading zeros and the substring `t` contains one of those leading zeros. In such a case, the output will not be the smallest possible integer `n`.
- The code does not ensure that the order of the digits in `n` is preserved as they appear in `s`. It only appends the digits from `s` that are also in `t` followed by `t`. This may not result in the correct order of digits.
- The code does not consider the scenario where the substring `t` is not present in the original number `n`. In this case, the output should be an empty string, but the code returns a non-empty string.
