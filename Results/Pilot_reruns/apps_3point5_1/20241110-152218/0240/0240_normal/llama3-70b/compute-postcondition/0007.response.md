Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`.***
