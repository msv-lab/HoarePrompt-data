According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in string `s` and the unique characters in set `t_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has more characters left, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is updated with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be considered. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` should be updated with the value of `c` added to the end. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` should remain unchanged.

State: **`s` has more characters left, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is updated with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`.**
