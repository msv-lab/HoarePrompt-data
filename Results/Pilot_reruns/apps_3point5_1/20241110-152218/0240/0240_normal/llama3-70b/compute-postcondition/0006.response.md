Example Answer:
The value of `n` is modified by adding the character `c` to the end. The previous value of `n` is known to be a string. After adding `c`, the value of `n` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c`.**
