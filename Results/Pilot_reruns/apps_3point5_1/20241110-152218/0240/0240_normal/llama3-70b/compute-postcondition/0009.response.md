Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is updated by adding the value of `c` to it. If `c` is in `t_set`, then the value of `c` is added to `n`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more characters left, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is updated with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`.
Output State: **`s` has more characters left, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is updated with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`**
