Postcondition: ***`s` has more characters left, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is updated with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged after adding `c` if `c` is in `t_set`. The state of the program variables `s`, `t_set`, and `n` is maintained as described, covering all possible scenarios when the if condition is evaluated.***
