Postcondition: ***`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. Edge cases are handled where the validity of the number is checked before yielding `candidate`.***
