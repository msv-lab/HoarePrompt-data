Example Answer:
The string elements in the list `perm` are concatenated together and assigned to the variable `candidate`. The function `is_valid_number` checks if `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub`. The values of `perm` and the outcome of the validation check are not given, so the output state is: `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in `perm`**
