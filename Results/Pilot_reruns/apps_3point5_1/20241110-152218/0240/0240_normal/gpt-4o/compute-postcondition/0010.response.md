Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the current state of `candidate`, which is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation. The yield statement does not change the state, so the output state is `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation**
