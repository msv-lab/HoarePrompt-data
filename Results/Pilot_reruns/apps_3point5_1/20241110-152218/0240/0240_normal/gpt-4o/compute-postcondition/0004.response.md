According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the validation of the `candidate` string generated from the elements of `perm` using the `is_valid_number` function. If `candidate` passes the validation check, the loop will execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the elements of `perm`. To execute the loop again, the `candidate` string needs to pass the validation check with respect to `sub` using the `is_valid_number` function.
Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`**
