The function func_1 takes two parameters, s and sub, which are strings of digits. It calculates the difference in the number of digits between s and sub, counts the occurrences of each digit in s, generates the remaining characters after subtracting the counts of sub from s, creates possible numbers from the remaining characters, and finally returns the smallest number among the possible numbers. The function operates under the assumption that s and sub are strings of digits and may not handle cases where s or sub contain non-digit characters or special cases like empty strings.
