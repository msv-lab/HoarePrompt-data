Example Answer: 
The function converts the value of `n` to an integer and returns it. The value of `n` is a concatenation of characters from `s` that are in `t_set` along with `t` if applicable. If `n` is empty, it remains empty. Therefore, the output state is: `n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t` if applicable, otherwise `n` remains empty, and the function returns the integer value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t` if applicable, otherwise `n` remains empty, and the function returns the integer value of `n`**
