Postcondition: ***`s` has characters remaining, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the new first character of `s` if `c` is in `t_set`, otherwise `n` remains unchanged. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to include `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
