According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in string `s`. Before the loop starts, the key requirement is that `s` is not empty. Additionally, since `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, it doesn't directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be empty and `c` should be the first character in `s`.
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character in `s`**
