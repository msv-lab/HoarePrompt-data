Example Answer:
If `s` is not empty and at least one character in `s` is found in `t_set`, `n` will contain all the characters from `s` that are in `t_set`. If `s` is empty or no characters in `s` are found in `t_set`, `n` will remain empty. The value of `n` is then concatenated with `t`. 
Output State: **`n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t` if applicable, otherwise `n` remains empty**
