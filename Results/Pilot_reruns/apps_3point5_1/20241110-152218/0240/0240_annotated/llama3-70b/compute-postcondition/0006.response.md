Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so `n` will have the new first character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the first character removed, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the new first character of `s`, `c` is the new first character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` has the first character removed, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the new first character of `s`, `c` is the new first character in `s`**
