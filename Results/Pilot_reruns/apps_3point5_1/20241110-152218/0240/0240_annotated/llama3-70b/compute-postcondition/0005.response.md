According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string that may or may not contain the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`. If the first character of `s` is found in `t_set`, it is appended to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be processed. This means the first character in `s` should be removed and the next character in `s` should be considered. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` has the first character removed, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string that may or may not contain the new first character of `s`, `c` is the new first character in `s`**
