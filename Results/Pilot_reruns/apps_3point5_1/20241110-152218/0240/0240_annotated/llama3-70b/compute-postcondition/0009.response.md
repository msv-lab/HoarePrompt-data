Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by the character `c`. If `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will contain the new first character of `s`, otherwise `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has characters remaining, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the new first character of `s` if `c` is in `t_set`, otherwise `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`s` has characters remaining, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the new first character of `s` if `c` is in `t_set`, otherwise `n` remains unchanged**
