According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations to generate from the characters in `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. Since `candidate` is the next permutation after `perm`, it means there are still more permutations to generate.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `candidate` needs to be generated, so the states to adjust are:
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.**
