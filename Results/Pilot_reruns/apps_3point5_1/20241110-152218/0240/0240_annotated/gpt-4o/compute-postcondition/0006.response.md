Example Answer:
Since the code snippet uses `yield`, it means it's inside a generator function. The current `candidate` value is yielded, which is the same as `perm`. Therefore, the output state is `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`**
