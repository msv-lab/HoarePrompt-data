Functionality: **The function func_1 takes two string parameters, s and sub, representing sequences of digits. It calculates the smallest number that can be obtained by removing characters from s while maintaining the order of characters in sub. The function returns this smallest number. If the sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the smallest number based on the initial s parameter.**
