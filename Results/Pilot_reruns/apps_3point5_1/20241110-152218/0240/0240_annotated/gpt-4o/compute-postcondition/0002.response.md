Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`. Since `candidate` is initially the same as `chars`, it yields the sequence of digits represented by `chars`. The other variables `perm` and `chars` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`**
