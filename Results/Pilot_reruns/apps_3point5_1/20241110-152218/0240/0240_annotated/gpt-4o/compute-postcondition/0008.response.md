According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more permutations of the characters in `chars` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`. To execute one more time, the next permutation after `perm` should be considered, so `perm` needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as the updated `perm`.**
