Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
