According to the code, the loop can execute if the `chars` string contains at least one digit. In this case, we need to ensure that the `chars` string contains at least one digit. Additionally, the loop variable `perm` will take on the different permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, and `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in the `chars` string.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`**
