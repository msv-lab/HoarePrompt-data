Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the string created by joining the characters of `perm`. The previous state of `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit. Therefore, after execution, `candidate` holds the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`**
