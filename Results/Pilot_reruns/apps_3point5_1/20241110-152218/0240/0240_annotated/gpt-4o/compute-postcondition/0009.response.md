Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. Since `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars` and `candidate` is the same as the updated `perm`, the value of `candidate` will be the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
