Example Answer:
The characters in `perm` are joined together to form a string `candidate`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` will be the same as `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`**
