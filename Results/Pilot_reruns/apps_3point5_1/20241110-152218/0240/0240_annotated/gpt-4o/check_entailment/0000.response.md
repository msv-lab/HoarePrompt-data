Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the substring `sub` contains leading zeros. The problem description states that the substring `sub` can contain leading zeros, but the code does not account for this scenario. In such cases, the code may not generate the correct smallest integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate.
