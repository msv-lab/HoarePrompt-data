You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the difference in the number of digits between strings `s` and `sub
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the difference in the number of digits between strings `s` and `sub`, `s_counter` is the Counter object of string `s`
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the difference in the number of digits between strings `s` and `sub`, `s_counter` is the Counter object of string `s`, `sub_counter` is the Counter object of string `sub`
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n_len remains the difference in the number of digits between strings s and sub, s_counter is the updated Counter object of string s, and sub_counter is an empty Counter object.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    #State of the program here: Output State: If sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n_len remains the difference in the number of digits between strings s and sub, s_counter is the updated Counter object of string s, and sub_counter is an empty Counter object.
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    #State of the program here: Output State: If sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n_len remains the difference in the number of digits between strings s and sub, s_counter is the updated Counter object of string s, and sub_counter is an empty Counter object. `possible_numbers` is assigned the result of the function `generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)`.
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    #State of the program here: If sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n_len remains the difference in the number of digits between strings s and sub, s_counter is the updated Counter object of string s, and sub_counter is an empty Counter object. `possible_numbers` is assigned the result of the function `generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)`. `smallest_number` is updated to the smallest number from `possible_numbers`
    return smallest_number
    #State of the program after the return statement: Output State: If sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n_len remains the difference in the number of digits between strings s and sub, s_counter is the updated Counter object of string s, and sub_counter is an empty Counter object. `possible_numbers` is assigned the result of the function `generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)`. `smallest_number` is updated to the smallest number from `possible_numbers` and the function returns the `smallest_number`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 takes two string parameters, s and sub, representing sequences of digits. It calculates the smallest number that can be obtained by removing characters from s while maintaining the order of characters in sub. The function returns this smallest number. If the sub_counter is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the smallest number based on the initial s parameter.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #State of the program after the return statement: `num_str` is a string representing a positive integer, `sub` is a non-empty substring of num_str, `n_len` is the length of num_str
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `is_valid_number` takes in three parameters: `num_str`, a string representing a positive integer, `sub`, a non-empty substring of `num_str`, and `n_len`, the length of `num_str`. The function then checks if `sub` is present in `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that `sub` is a valid substring of `num_str`.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #- If `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the loop will execute to generate permutations of the characters in `chars`. 
    #- For each permutation, `perm` will be assigned the current permutation, and `candidate` will be the string formed by joining the characters in the permutation. 
    #- If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` in the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the loop yields `candidate`. 
    #- If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no action is taken.
    #
    #**If chars is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the loop generates permutations, checks their validity, and yields valid candidates. If chars is an empty string, the loop does not execute.**
#Overall this is what the function does:
Functionality: The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the function generates permutations of the characters in `chars`. For each permutation, it creates a candidate string and checks its validity using the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If the candidate passes the validation, it yields the candidate. If `chars` is an empty string, the function does not execute the loop.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
