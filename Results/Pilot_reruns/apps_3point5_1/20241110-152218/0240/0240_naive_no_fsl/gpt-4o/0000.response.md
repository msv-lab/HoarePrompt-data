Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The `generate_possible_numbers` function uses permutations to generate all possible numbers, but this approach does not guarantee the smallest possible initial number `n` as required by the problem description. The program should instead focus on rearranging the given string `s` to find the smallest number possible. 

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to ensure that it rearranges the string `s` in a way that produces the smallest possible initial integer `n` while still containing the remembered substring `sub`.
