Postcondition: ***n is at least 1. colors is a list of n integers ranging from 1 to m. k is a list of m integers. desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k. current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values initialized such that for each color in desired_counts, current_counts[color] is less than desired_counts[color. If all current_counts[color] are equal to desired_counts[color] for all colors in desired_counts, the function returns 'YES'.***
