Example Answer: 
The value of the color at index `right` in the list `colors` is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is at least 1, colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, k is a list of m integers, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values initialized, right is 0.
Output State: **n is at least 1, colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, k is a list of m integers, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values initialized, right is 0**
