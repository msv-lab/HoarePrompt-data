Example Answer: 
`left` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, k is a list of m integers, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, and current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values initialized**
