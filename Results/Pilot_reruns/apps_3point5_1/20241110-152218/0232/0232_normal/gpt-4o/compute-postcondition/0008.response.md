Output State: **n is at least 1, colors is a list of n integers ranging from 1 to m, k is a list of m integers, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values initialized such that for each color in desired_counts, current_counts[color] is less than desired_counts[color, right is 0 and the function returns 'YES'**
