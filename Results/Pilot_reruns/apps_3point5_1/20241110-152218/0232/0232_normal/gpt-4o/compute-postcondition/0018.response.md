Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in `colors` is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` and `desired_counts` have been adjusted to satisfy the condition, `right` is increased by 2, and the count of the color at index `right` in `colors` has been incremented by 1 in `current_counts` dictionary.
Output State: **`current_counts` and `desired_counts` have been adjusted to satisfy the condition, `right` is increased by 2, and the count of the color at index `right` in `colors` has been incremented by 1 in `current_counts` dictionary**
