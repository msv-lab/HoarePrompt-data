Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 0 if `color` was not already in the dictionary. The dictionary `color_counts` may contain mappings for other colors as well. This postcondition covers the case when `color` is the first color in the list and ensures that the dictionary `color_counts` is appropriately updated based on whether `color` was already present in the dictionary or not.***
