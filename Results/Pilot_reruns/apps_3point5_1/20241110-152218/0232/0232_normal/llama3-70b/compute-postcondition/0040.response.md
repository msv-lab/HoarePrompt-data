Postcondition: ***`found` remains True, `i` remains 0, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is updated to 0 if it was not present before, `j` is incremented by 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. In all cases, the program ensures that the color key is added to `window_counts` with a value of 0 if it did not exist previously.***
