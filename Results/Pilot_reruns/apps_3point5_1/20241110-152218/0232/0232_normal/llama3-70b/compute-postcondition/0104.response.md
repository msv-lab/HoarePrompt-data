Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is updated with the count of the new `color`, `j` is incremented by 1, `color` is assigned the value of the next `colors` element. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
