Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. The program handles the case where `color` is not in `window_counts` by initializing it to 0 in the dictionary.***
