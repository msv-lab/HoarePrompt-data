Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains 0. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color key has a corresponding value that represents the count of that color. `j` is equal to `i` at the beginning of each iteration and is incremented by 1. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` at each iteration. If `colors` is an empty list or the condition in the if statement is never met, `found` remains False. If `found` is True, the loop is terminated.***
