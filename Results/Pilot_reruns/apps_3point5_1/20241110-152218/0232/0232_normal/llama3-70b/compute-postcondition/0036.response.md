Postcondition: ***`found` remains True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains 0. `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` remains a dictionary with color keys and corresponding values. `j` is incremented by 1 and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
