Example Answer:
The list `counts` is created by mapping each input element to an integer. The values of the `counts` list are obtained from the input, which is already provided as a list of integers in the initial state. Therefore, the `counts` list will be the same as the initial `colors` list obtained from the input.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers containing the values obtained from the input, `counts` is a list of integers containing the values obtained from the input**
