Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each `color` encountered is mapped to its count (increased by 1 if `color` was already in `window_counts`). `j` is equal to `i + number of iterations`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + number of iterations]`. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
