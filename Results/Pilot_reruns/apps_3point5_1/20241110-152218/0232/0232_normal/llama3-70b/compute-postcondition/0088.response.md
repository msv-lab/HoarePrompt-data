Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains 1. `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` is updated with the count of the new `color`. `j` is equal to `i`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
