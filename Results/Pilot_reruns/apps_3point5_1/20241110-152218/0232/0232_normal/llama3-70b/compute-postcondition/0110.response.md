Output State: **If `colors` is empty or the condition in the if statement is never met, `found` remains False. If `found` is True, it means that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains the same throughout the loop iterations. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color key has a corresponding value that represents the count of that color. `j` is equal to the last value of `j` in the loop. `color` is assigned the value of the last `colors` element.**
