Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The dictionary will store the count of each color of lightsabers. Since no values are assigned to the dictionary, the output state is:
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with the total count being at least 1 and at most n; color_counts is an empty dictionary**
