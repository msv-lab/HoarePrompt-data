Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the key `color` with a value of 0. `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`, `j` remains 0. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]` based on the actual value at index 0 of the `colors` list. If the color is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The initial conditions of the variables remain unchanged, and the dictionary `window_counts` is updated only if the color was not previously present in it.***
