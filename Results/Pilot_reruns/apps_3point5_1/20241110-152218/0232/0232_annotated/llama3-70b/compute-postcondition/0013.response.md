Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0, where `color` is the first color in the colors list. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 3 colors, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m with the total count being at least 1 and at most n; color_counts is a dictionary containing the first color in the colors list with a value of 1, and the count of the specific color is incremented by 1 in color_counts, and color_counts[color] is 0.
