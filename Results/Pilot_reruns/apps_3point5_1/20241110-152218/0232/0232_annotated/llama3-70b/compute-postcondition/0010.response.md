Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 2 colors, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m with the total count being at least 1 and at most n; color_counts is a dictionary containing the first color in the colors list with a value of 1. If the color is not already in color_counts, it is added to color_counts with a count of 0.***
