Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing color counts, `i` remains 0, and `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`. If the loop breaks due to `found` being True after all counts match the targets, `found` remains True. However, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, indicating the loop did not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is False.***
