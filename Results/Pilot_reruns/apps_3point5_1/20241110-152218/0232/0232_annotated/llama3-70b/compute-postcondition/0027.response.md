Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary that contains the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary that now contains a key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
