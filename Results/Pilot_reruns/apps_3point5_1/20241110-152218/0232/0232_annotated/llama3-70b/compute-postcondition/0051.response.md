According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least equal to i, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `j` is now equal to `i`.
State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `i`**
