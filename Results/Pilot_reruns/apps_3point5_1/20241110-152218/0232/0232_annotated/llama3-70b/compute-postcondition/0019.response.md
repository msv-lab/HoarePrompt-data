According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. Since `color_counts` will contain the count of each color in the `colors` list after the loop executes, we need to ensure that `colors` is not an empty list for the loop to execute successfully. 

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary that contains the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0**
