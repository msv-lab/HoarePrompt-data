According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing color counts, `i` is 0, and `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary containing color counts, `i` is 1, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`**
