Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` dictionary contains a key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is incremented by 1, `found` is True, `color` is the color at index `j+1` in the `colors` list. The if statement checks if all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts in `counts`. If this condition is satisfied, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
