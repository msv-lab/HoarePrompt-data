According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `window_counts` needs to be modified to ensure the loop can execute. Additionally, since the loop starts at `i`, the state should reflect that `j` starts at `i`.

State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1**
