Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary that contains the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary that now contains a key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`. This ensures that the color count in `window_counts` is properly initialized, maintaining the integrity of the initial conditions.***
