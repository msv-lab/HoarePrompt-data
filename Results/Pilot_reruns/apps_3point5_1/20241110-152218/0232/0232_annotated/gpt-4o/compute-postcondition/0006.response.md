Postcondition: ***desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all values in current_counts for each color match the corresponding values in desired_counts, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
