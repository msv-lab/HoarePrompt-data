Example Answer:
The `desired_counts` dictionary is created by zipping the range from 1 to `m` with the list `k`. The range will be from 1 to the value of `m` which is a positive integer in the range 1 to 100. The list `k` contains `m` integers such that their sum is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the `desired_counts` dictionary will have keys ranging from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from the list `k`. 
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k**
