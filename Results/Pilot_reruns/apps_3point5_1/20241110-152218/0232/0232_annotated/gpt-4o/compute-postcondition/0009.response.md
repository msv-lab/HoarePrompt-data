Postcondition: ***desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, left is 0, right is 0, n is greater than 0, and at least one color has a value in current_counts that is less than the corresponding value in desired_counts. If all values in current_counts match the values in desired_counts for all colors, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not enter the else part and no changes are made to the state of the variables.***
