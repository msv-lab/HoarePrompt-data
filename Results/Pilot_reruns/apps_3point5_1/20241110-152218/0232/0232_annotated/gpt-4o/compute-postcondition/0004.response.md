Example Answer:
`current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `current_counts`, `colors`, `left`, `right`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
