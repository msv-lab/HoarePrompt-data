Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The values of `desired_counts` and `current_counts` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, `left` is 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values, `left` is 0**
