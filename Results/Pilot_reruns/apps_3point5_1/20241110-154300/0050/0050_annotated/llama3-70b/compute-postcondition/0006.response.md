According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions are met as `n` is between 1 and 30. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
