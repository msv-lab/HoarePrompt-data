Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is an integer, `i` is 2. If r >= s[i], `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i] where r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
