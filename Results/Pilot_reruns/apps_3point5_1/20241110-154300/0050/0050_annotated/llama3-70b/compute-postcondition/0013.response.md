Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is an integer, `i` is 1; `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i] and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`**
