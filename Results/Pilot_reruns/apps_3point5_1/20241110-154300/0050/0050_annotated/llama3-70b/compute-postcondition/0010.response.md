Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is an integer, `i` is 0. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated by the floor division result of r and s[i], and r is updated by the modulo operation with s[i]. If r < s[i], then the loop breaks.***
