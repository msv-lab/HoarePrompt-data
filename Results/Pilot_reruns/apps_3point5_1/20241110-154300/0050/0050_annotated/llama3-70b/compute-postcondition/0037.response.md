Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer greater than the current value of `i+1`, `r` is updated based on the conditions, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `s` is a list of integers. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If shares is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
