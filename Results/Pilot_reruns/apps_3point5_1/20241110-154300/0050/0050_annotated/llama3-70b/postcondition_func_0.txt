The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from the user input, then reads two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It sorts both lists, calculates the number of shares based on the values in list `s`, and updates the value of `r` accordingly. Then, it calculates a new value for `r` based on the shares and values in list `b`. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `r`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the user input.
