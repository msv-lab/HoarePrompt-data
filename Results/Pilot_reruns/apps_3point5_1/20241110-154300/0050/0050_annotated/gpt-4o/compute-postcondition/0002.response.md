Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the list of integers obtained from input by splitting the input string. The values of variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**
