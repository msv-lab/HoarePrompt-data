Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are updated by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split by whitespace, and the first value is assigned to `n`, the second to `m`, and the third to `r`. Since the input values are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000**
