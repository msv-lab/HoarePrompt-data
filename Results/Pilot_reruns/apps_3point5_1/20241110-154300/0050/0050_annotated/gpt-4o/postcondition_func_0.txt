The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input and two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum value from list `s` as `min_buy_price` and the maximum value from list `b` as `max_sell_price`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the modulus operation of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. The function does not return any value.
