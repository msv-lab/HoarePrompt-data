The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from lists `s` and `b` where `s` and `b` are lists of integers. The absolute difference between two elements `x` and `y` is calculated as `abs(x-y)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements from lists `s` and `b`.
