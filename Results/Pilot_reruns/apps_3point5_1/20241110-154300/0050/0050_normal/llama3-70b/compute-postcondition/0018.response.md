Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `b` are positive integers. `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], then shares is updated by adding the division of r by the element at index i in s. r is then assigned the remainder of r divided by the element at index i in s. The index i is incremented by 1. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. `i` is one more than the previous iteration.**
