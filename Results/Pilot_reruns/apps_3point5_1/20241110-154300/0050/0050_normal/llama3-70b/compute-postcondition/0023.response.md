According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are positive integers, `b` is sorted in descending order, and `s` is sorted in ascending order. The loop will iterate at least once. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are positive integers, `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order, `shares` is initialized, `i` is 0**
