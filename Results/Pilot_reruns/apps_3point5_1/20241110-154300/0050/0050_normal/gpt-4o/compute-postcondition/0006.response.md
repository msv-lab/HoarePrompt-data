Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`. Given that `r`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_shares` are positive integers, the result of the floor division `r // min_buy_price` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is a positive integer**
