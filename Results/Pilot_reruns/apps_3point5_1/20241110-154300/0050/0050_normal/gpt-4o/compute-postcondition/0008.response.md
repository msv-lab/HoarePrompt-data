Example Answer:
`total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and adding `remaining_bourles`. Given that `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are all positive integers, the calculation results in a positive integer value for `total_bourles`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_bourles` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`total_bourles` is a positive integer**
