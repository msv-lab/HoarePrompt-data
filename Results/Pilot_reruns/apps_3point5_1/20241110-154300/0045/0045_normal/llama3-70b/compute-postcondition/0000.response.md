Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so the output state is the new values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation.
Output State: **New values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation**
