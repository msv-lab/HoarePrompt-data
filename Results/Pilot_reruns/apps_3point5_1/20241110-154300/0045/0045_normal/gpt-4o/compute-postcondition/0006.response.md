According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is at least 1. The loop will iterate from `k - 1` to 0, so the loop can execute as long as `k` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, so we know that `k` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `i` will be `k - 1`, so the loop can execute with `k` being a positive integer.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of the subtraction, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1`.**
