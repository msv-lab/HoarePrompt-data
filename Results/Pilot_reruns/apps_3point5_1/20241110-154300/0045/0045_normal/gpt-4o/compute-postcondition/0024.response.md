The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case 1: If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` (min_sum) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.

Case 2: If min_sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates `d` by dividing `n` by min_sum, calculates `sequence` as a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. If at any point during the loop the remainder is 0, the loop breaks out. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. The function returns `sequence`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and if the sum of integers from 1 to `k` is greater than `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence based on the conditions described above and returns it.
