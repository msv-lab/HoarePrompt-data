According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range specified in the for loop statement, which means `i` should be -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
