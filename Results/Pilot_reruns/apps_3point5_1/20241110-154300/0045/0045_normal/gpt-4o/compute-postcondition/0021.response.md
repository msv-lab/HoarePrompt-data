According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is in the range from 0 to `k-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 3, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is -2. Since `i` is -2, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 3, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
