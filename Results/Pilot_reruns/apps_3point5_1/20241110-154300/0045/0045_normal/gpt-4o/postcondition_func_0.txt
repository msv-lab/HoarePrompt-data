The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence based on the conditions described in the code and returns it. Additionally, the function handles cases where `k` is less than 1 by not executing the loop and maintaining the initial values. The code accurately calculates the sequence and handles the edge case where `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop, breaking out of the loop.
