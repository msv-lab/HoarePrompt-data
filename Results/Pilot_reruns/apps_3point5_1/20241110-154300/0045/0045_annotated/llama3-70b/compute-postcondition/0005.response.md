According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `b` is true (non-zero). At the end of the last iteration, `a` is true (non-zero), `b` is true (non-zero). To ensure that the loop executes one more time, no states need to be adjusted as `b` is already true (non-zero).
State: **`a` is true (non-zero), `b` is true (non-zero)**
