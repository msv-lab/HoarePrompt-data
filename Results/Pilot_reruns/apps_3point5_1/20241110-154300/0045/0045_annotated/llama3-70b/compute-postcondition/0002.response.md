Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped with `b` becoming the result of `a % b`. Since `b` is true (non-zero), the new value of `b` is 0. The new value of `a` is the previous value of `b`, which is true (non-zero). Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is true (non-zero), `b` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is true (non-zero), `b` is 0**
