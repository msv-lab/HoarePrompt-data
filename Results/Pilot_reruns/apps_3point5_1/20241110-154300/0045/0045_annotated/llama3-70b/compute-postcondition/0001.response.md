According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable b. If b is true (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a and b have been updated accordingly. To make sure the loop can execute one more time, b needs to be true (non-zero) at the end of the last iteration.
State: **a and b have been updated accordingly, b is true (non-zero)**
