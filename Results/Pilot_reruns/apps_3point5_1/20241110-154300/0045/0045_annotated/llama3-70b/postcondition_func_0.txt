The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` by iteratively updating `a` and `b` within a loop until `b` becomes 0. If `b` is initially 0, the function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor. If `b` is not 0, the function continues updating `a` and `b` until `b` reaches 0. The final value of `a` is then returned. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine the greatest common divisor of the two input integers.
