Correctness: False

The provided code snippet defines a function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers `a` and `b`. However, the problem description requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor.

The code snippet does not generate the sequence of `k` positive numbers as required by the problem description. Instead, it focuses on calculating the greatest common divisor of two input numbers. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

An example where the code does not work correctly based on the problem description:
Input:
n = 6, k = 3
Expected Output: 1 2 3

The code snippet does not generate the sequence [1, 2, 3] for the input (6, 3) as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
