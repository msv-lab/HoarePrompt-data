Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to k and if the sum exceeds n, it returns -1. Then, it determines a sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The code handles the remainder properly and adjusts the sequence accordingly. All the provided examples are correctly handled by the code as well. The annotations also align with the code logic and help in understanding the flow of the program.
