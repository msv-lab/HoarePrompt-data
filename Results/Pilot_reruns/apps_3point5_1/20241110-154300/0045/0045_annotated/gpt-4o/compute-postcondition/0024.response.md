The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. The function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `k` and stores it in `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.

In Case 2, if the remainder is 0 before the loop starts, the sequence remains unchanged, and the remainder stays 0. If the remainder is not 0 before the loop starts, the sequence values may change during the loop execution, and the remainder becomes 0 after the loop finishes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range of 1 to 10^10, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, and return -1 if the sum is greater than `n`. The function also handles the sequence values and remainder based on the conditions mentioned in Case 2.
