According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is k-2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to k-3 so that it remains within the range of `k - 1` to `0`.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is k-3**
