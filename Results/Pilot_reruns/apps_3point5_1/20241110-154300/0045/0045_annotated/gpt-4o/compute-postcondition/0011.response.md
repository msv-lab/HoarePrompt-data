According to the code, the loop can execute again if the loop variable `i` is within the range specified by `range(k-1, -1, -1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of the subtraction. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program execution breaks. `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the loop variable `i` based on the current values. Since the loop is iterating from `k-1` down to 0, we should decrease the current value of `i` by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is the result of the subtraction, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is k-2**
