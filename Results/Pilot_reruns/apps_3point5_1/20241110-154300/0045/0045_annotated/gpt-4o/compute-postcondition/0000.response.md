Example Answer:
`min_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates this sum. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` is `(k * (k + 1)) // 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`**
