Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. The value of `n` and `k` remains the same, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`**
