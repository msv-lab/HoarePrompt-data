According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` starts from `k - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is the result of the subtraction, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
