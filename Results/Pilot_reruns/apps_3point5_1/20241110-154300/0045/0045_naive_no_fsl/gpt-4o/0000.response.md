Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two numbers n and k, where n is the positive integer and k is the number of elements in the sequence to be generated. It then calculates the minimum sum of the sequence using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If the minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor and generates the sequence accordingly. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists or -1 if not.

The program covers all potential cases and generates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor. The logic of the program is correct and it follows the problem description for all possible inputs.
