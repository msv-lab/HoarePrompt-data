Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Then it takes input for n and k.
3. If n is less than k, it prints -1.
4. Otherwise, it creates a sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the GCD is maximal.
5. It then prints the resulting sequence.
