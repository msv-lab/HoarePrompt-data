Correctness: False

The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the calculation of the numerator and denominator within the for loop. The code is supposed to calculate the probability by multiplying the remaining days for each person's birthday, but it does not do this correctly. Additionally, the GCD calculation and subsequent division are not sufficient to guarantee the correct probability calculation. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case as it does not accurately calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday.
