Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying its current value by `total_days`. Since `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, the `denominator` will be further multiplied by that result. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by (2^n) * (total_days - i), `denominator` is equal to the updated value after multiplying by `total_days`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.
