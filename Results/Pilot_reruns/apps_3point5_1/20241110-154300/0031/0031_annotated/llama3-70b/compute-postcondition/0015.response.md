Example Answer: 
The `numerator` is divided by `gcd` using integer division. The previous values of `numerator` and `gcd` are needed to calculate the result. After the division, the new value of `numerator` is determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of numerator divided by gcd, `denominator` maintains its previous value, `gcd` remains the same.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of numerator divided by gcd, `denominator` maintains its previous value, `gcd` remains the same**
