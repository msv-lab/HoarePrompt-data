Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is divided by `gcd` using the floor division operator `//`. The previous value of `denominator` and `gcd` are used in this operation. After execution, the value of `denominator` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of numerator divided by gcd, `denominator` is updated after floor division, `gcd` remains the same.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of numerator divided by gcd, `denominator` is updated after floor division, `gcd` remains the same**
