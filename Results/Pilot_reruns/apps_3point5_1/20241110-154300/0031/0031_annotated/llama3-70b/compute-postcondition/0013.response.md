Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the product of (2^n) multiplied by the values from total_days down to total_days - k + 1 for numerator, and updates denominator to the product of total_days for each iteration. If k is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and numerator remains 1, denominator remains 2^n.**
