The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The preconditions state that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 2 <= k <= 10^18. The constants `MOD`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. After executing the function body, if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the function prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `MOD`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `MOD`, `n`, and `k`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables MOD, n, and k.**
