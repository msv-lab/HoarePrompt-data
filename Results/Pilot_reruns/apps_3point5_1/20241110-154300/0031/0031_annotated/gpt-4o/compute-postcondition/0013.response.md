According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 2, `denominator` is updated to the new value after the calculation `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`**
