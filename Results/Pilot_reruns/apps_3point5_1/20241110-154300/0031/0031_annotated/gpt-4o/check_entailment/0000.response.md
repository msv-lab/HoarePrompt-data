Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days, as described in the problem statement.
2. The code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of A and B, ensuring that the final output is in irreducible form.
3. The code also handles cases where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 and 1 as specified in the problem description.
4. The code uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.
