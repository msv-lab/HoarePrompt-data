Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. The issue lies in the calculation of the numerator and denominator in the function `func_1`.

To illustrate the problem, consider the input:
```
n = 3
k = 2
```

In this case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland and ZS the Coder wants to interview 2 people. The correct probability is 1/8, as mentioned in the problem description. However, the program does not produce the correct result for this case.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
