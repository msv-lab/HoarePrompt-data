Example Answer:
The `denominator` is multiplied by the updated value of `total_days`. Since `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, the `denominator` will be further multiplied by 2^n. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n multiplied by (total_days - i), `denominator` is the result of multiplying the previous `denominator` by the updated `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n multiplied by (total_days - i), `denominator` is the result of multiplying the previous `denominator` by the updated `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
