According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n multiplied by (total_days - 2), `denominator` is the result of multiplying the previous `denominator` by the updated `total_days`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
