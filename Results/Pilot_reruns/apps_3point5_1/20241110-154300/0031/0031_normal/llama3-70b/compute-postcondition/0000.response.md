Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where `2 ** n` calculates the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, the result of this calculation can be quite large. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`**
