According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n, `denominator` is the result of multiplying the previous `denominator` by the updated `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n, `denominator` is the result of multiplying the previous `denominator` by the updated `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
