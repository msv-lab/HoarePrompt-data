According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is updated according to the calculation, `denominator` is updated according to the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
