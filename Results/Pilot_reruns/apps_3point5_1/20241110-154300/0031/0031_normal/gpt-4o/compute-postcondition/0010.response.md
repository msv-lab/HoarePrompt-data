According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. Therefore, only `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated according to the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
