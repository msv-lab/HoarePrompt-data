Example Answer: 
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, which is equal to `denominator`. The value of `p_shared` is unknown but is calculated using a formula. `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, which is equal to `denominator`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated using an unknown formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated using an unknown formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `denominator`**
