Example Answer:
The value of `p_shared` is assigned to `A`, but the calculation of `p_shared` is not provided. Without knowing the formula to calculate `p_shared`, we cannot determine the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated using an unknown formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated using an unknown formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`**
