The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It then updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the modulo operation if `b` is not 0. If `b` is initially 0, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop has finished executing.
