Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input non-negative integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them to determine which number is greater. The comparisons are done based on the actual numerical values of the integers, so the output will be correct for all cases. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
