The function `func` reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` and `b`, and compares them. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on user input for `a` and `b`. The function handles cases where `a` and `b` have leading zeros removed and have up to 10^6 digits.
