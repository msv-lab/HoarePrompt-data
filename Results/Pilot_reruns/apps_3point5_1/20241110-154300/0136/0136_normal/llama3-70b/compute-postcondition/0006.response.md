Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'.***
