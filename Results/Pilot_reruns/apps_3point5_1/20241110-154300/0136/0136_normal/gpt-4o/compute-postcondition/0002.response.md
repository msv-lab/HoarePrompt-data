Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` after removing leading zeros. The values of `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `data`, the exact value of `b` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits**
