Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the string '0'. The value of `a` is now '0'. The state of the other variable `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is '0', `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits**
