Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Upon initial assessment, the code seems to be following the problem description. The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with at most 10^6 digits. It then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The code handles the cases where `a` or `b` may contain leading zeros by stripping them before comparison. The code seems to cover all potential cases and aligns with the problem description.

The output hints also confirm that the code is correct. The hints describe the same logic that the code is implementing, and there are no discrepancies between the hints and the code. Thus, it can be concluded that the code is correct for all potential cases.
