The function func_1 reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. This function handles very large numbers represented as strings, ensuring correct comparison even with leading zeros removed.
