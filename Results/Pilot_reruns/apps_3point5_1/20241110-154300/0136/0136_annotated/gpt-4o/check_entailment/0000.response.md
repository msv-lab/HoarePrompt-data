Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. It correctly determines which number is greater or if they are equal, as per the problem description. The annotations also align with the code logic, describing the state of the program at different points and the comparison process. All the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the program is correct and returns the expected output for all potential cases.
