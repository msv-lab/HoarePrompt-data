Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. If `b` is an empty string, it is considered as '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='.***
