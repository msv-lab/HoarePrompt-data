Example Answer:
The input is accepted as a string and leading zeros are stripped off from the string. The variable `a` is assigned the modified input value. The other variable `b` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits**
