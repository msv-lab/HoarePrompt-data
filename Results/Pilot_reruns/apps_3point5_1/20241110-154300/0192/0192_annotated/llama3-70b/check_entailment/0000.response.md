Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. 

For example, in the case of Input 6 3, the expected output should be 4 as per the problem description, but the code will output 3 (6-3 = 3).

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y.
