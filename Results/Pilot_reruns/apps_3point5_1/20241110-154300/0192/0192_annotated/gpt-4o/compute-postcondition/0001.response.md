Example Answer:
The expression calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Since x and y are integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the value of (x - y) will always be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, (x - y) // 2 will always result in a positive integer, and (x - y) % 2 will be either 0 or 1. The final result will be the sum of these two values. The initial values of x and y are not affected by the code. 
Output State: **No change in the initial state, the output of the expression is a positive integer.**
