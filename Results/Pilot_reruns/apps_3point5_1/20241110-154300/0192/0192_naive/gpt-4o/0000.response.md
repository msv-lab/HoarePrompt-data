Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The logic used in the program is correct. It calculates the absolute difference between x and y, divides it by 2, and adds the remainder if the difference is odd. This correctly represents the minimum number of steps required to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y.

For all potential cases, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output.
