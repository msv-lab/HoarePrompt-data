Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes in the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths as input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and then prints the result. The logic used in the code is correct as it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting side length x. 

For all the given test cases, the program produces the correct output as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
