Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs()` function and prints the result. The initial values of `x` and `y` satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the absolute difference between `x` and `y` will always be a positive integer. 
Output State: **The absolute difference between x and y is printed.**
