Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integer values x and y from the input, calculates the absolute difference between x and y, and prints the result. The problem description clearly states that Memory wants to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x by modifying the length of a single side such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle with integer side lengths. The code achieves this by calculating the absolute difference between the two side lengths, which represents the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
