Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
- It then calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2), which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
- The code accurately follows the problem description and the provided examples, as it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to reach the desired equilateral triangle length. 
- The output hints were also accurate in summarizing the code functionality and did not provide any contradicting information, hence strengthening the correctness of the code.
