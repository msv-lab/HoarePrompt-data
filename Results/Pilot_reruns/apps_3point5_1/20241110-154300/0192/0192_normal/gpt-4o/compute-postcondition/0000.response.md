Example Answer: 
`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split by space. Since the input is not provided here, the values of `x` and `y` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: Precondition: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **Precondition: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
