Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if the remainder is already in the set 'seen'. If it is, then it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, if all remainders are distinct, it prints 'Yes'. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if all remainders are distinct.
