Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if all the remainders are distinct by keeping track of seen remainders in a set. It returns "No" if the number of remainders is greater than or equal to the input k. Otherwise, it iterates through all remainders and checks if they are distinct, returning "No" if a duplicate is found. Otherwise, it returns "Yes". 

The program covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
