Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. If the `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
