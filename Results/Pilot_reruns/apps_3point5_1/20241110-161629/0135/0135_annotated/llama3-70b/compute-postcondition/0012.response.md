Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1. `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`, where `i` is 2. `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.***
