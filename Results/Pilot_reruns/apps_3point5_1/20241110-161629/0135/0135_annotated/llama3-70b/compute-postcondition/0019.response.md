Example Answer: 
`remainder` is added to the `seen` set. If `remainder` is present in the `seen` set, then the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in the `seen` set, no action is taken. The states of `n` and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2**
