Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is k + 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is k + 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i**.
