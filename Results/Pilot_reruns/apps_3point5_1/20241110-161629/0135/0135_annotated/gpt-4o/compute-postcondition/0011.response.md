According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to k. At the end of the previous iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is k + 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than or equal to k, so `i` needs to be adjusted to k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is k, `remainder` is the result of `n % k`**
