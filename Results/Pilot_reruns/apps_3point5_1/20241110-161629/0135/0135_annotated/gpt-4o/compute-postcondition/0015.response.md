Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, which are integers in the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function iterates over values from 1 to k inclusive, calculates the remainder of n divided by each value, and checks for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate is found, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, the function returns 'Yes'. If k is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and seen_remainders remains an empty set. **
