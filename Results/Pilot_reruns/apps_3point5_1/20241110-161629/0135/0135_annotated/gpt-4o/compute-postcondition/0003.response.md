According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` being an empty set does not directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `seen_remainders` is an empty set and `k` is a positive integer.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer**
