Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No' as expected. Then, it iterates over values from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by each value, and checks for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The code also handles the case where k is less than or equal to 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and seen_remainders remains an empty set.

The annotations provided also accurately describe the state of the program at different points and explain the logic behind the code. They mention the conditions under which the function returns 'No' and describe how the set seen_remainders is used to keep track of unique remainders.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations provide additional clarity on the program's behavior.
