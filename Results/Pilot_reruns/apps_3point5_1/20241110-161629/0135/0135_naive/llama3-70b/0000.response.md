Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input values for n and k, then iterates through all integers from 1 to k to calculate the remainder of n divided by each integer. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases where there might be duplicate remainders. It ensures that for every pair of integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k, the remainders n % i and n % j are distinct. Therefore, the program is correct.
