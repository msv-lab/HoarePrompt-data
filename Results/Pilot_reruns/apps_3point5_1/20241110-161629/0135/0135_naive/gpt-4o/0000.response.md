Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and k.
2. The function `func_1` correctly checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No' as there would be no distinct remainders.
3. The program then iterates through all values of i from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if this remainder is already in the set of seen remainders.
4. If the remainder is already seen, it returns 'No' as there are duplicates. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
5. If the program completes the loop without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.
6. The program outputs the correct result based on the input values provided.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines whether all remainders are distinct for a given n and k.
