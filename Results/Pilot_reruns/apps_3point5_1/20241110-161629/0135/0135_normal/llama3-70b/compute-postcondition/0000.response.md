Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts space-separated inputs and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `k`, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
