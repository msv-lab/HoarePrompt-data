Example Answer:
`remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. The initial state has `seen` as a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is added to `seen`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains the updated values of `remainder`.
Output State: **`seen` contains the updated values of `remainder`**
