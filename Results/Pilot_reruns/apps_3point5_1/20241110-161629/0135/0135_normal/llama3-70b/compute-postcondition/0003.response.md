Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by taking the modulus of `n` divided by `i`. The states of `seen`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`seen` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
