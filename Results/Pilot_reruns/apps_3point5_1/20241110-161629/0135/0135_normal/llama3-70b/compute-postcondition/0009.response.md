Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is divided by `i` and the remainder is stored in `remainder`. The initial values of `n` and `i` are not provided, so the output state will be: `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
