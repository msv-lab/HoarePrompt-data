According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to `seen`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to `seen`**
