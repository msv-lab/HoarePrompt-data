According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` being an empty set does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` needs to be set to 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
