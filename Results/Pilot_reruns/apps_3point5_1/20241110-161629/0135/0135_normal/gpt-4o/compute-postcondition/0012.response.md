Output State: **If `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The loop checks if the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is already in `seen_remainders` set. If it is, the function returns 'No'. After the loop finishes, `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the division of `n` by `i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.**
