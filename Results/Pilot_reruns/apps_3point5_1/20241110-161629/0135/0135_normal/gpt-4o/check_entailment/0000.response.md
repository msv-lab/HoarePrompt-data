Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers n and k as input.
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No' as mentioned in the problem description.
- The function then iterates through values from 1 to k, storing remainders of n divided by i in a set.
- If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No' as specified in the problem description.
- If the loop completes without duplicates and k is positive, the function returns 'Yes' as expected.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code, ensuring that the code is correct.
