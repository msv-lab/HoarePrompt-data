Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values of n, m, k, a, and b. Then it calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments. After that, it calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering the distance between blocks and floors. The calculations for the minimum block time and minimum floor time are correct based on the problem description. The program handles the scenario of moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the building to find the shortest path correctly. Additionally, it correctly outputs the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Since the program addresses all the cases and logic as described in the problem statement, it can be considered correct.
