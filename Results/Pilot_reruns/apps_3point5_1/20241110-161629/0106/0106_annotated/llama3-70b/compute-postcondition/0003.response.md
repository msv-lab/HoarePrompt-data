Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are provided as inputs, and `a_floor` is the floor value of `a` within the range of `1` to `m`. After calculation, the value of `a_block` will be determined based on the provided values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k`.
Output State: **`n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k`**.
