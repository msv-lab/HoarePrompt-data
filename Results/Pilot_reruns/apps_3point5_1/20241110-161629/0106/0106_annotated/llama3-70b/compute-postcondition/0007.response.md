Example Answer:
`min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated values, so we need to substitute their formulas in the equation to calculate `min_floor_time`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range; a is the first input integer; b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k; b_floor is the calculated value based on the formula (b - 1) % m + 1; b_block is the calculated value based on the formula provided; min_block_time is the minimum block time calculated based on the formula provided; min_floor_time is calculated based on the values of a, b, m, and k.`
