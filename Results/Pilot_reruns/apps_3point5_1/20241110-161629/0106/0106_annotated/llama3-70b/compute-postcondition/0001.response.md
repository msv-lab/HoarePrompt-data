Example Answer:
The values entered through input are split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The first integer is assigned to variable `a` and the second integer is assigned to variable `b`. Since the initial state does not mention the values of `a` and `b`, the output state will be: `n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer`.
Output State: **`n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer`**
