Example Answer: 

`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `b` is the second input integer, so after execution, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k, b_floor is the calculated value based on the formula (b - 1) % m + 1; b_block is the calculated value based on the formula provided.`
Output State: **`n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k, b_floor is the calculated value based on the formula (b - 1) % m + 1; b_block is the calculated value based on the formula provided.`**
