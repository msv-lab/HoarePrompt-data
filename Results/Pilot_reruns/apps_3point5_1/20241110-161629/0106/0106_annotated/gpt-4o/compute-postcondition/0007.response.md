Example Answer:
The minimum walking time is calculated by taking the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. No other variables are affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` are determined based on the initial values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `n`.
Output State: **`block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` are determined based on the initial values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `n`**
