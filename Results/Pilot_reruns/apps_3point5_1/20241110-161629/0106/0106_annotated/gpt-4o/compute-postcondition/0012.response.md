Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates `time_to_target_floor` based on a formula and then computes `total_time` as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The function returns the calculated `total_time`. However, the annotations mention that certain variables remain unchanged throughout the function, which might not accurately reflect the code's behavior. The function should handle edge cases where the input parameters do not meet the specified conditions, and missing functionality includes error handling for invalid inputs.**
