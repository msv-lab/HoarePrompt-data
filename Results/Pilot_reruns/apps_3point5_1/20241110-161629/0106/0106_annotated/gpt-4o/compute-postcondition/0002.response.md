Example Answer: 
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1 to it. The value of `floor_within_block` is dependent on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial state is not provided for these variables, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor`. Therefore, the output state is: `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the given values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k.
Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated based on the given values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
