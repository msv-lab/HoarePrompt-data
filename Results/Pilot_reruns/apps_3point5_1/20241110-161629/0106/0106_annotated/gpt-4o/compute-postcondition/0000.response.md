Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are given in the precondition, and based on those values, the value of `block` can be calculated. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **`block` is calculated based on the given values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the given values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
