Output State: **`block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` are determined based on the initial values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `n`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.**
