Functionality: ** The function `get_location` takes an integer parameter `apartment` and calculates the block and floor within that block based on the given values of `m` and `k`. The function returns a tuple containing the block and floor numbers. The code correctly computes the block and floor within the block as described in the annotations. However, it lacks information on the ranges or constraints for `m` and `k`, and it does not handle potential edge cases where the input values might not satisfy the assumptions made in the annotations. **
