Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately calculates the total time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given inputs and the constraints provided in the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` work together to correctly determine the block and floor within that block for each apartment, as well as calculate the time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment considering the various factors such as current floor, direct walk time, reverse walk time, and target floor. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided, ensuring that the time taken is accurately calculated for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, it can be concluded that the code is correct.
