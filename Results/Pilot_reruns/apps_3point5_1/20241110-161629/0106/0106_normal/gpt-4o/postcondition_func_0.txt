The function `func_1` takes integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` satisfying the constraints 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. It calculates the time to reach the target floor `b` based on various factors such as current floor, direct walk time, reverse walk time, and target floor. The total time taken to reach the target floor is then returned. The function accurately calculates the total time based on the provided parameters and conditions. However, it lacks handling edge cases where certain parameters might not be within the specified constraints, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
