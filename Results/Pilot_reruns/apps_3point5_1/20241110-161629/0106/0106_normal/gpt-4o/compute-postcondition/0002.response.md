Example Answer: 
`floor` is calculated based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `k` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`.
Output State: **block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`**
