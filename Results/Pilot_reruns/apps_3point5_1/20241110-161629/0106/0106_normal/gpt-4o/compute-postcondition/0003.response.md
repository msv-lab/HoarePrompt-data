Example Answer:
The variables `block` and `floor` are returned as they are without any modifications. The values of `block` and `floor_within_block` are not provided, so the output state is: block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`.
Output State: **block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`**
