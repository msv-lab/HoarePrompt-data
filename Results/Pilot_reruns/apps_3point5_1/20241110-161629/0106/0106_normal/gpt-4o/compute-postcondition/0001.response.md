Example Answer: 
`floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The value of `block` is not directly used in this calculation, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation.
Output State: **block is a positive integer, floor_within_block is calculated based on the equation**
