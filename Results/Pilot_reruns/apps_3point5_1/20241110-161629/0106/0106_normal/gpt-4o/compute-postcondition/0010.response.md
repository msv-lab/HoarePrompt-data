Example Answer:
The function returns `total_time`, which is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. Therefore, the output state is `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and the function returns `total_time`.
Output State: **`time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and the function returns `total_time`**
