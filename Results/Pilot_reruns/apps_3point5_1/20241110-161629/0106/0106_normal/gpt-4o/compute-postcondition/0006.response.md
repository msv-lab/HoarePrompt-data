Example Answer:
`reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula provided using the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`. The calculation involves finding the distance between `block_a` and `block_b` in a circular manner within the range of `n`. The output state is not explicitly mentioned to change any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, k, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k; block_a and floor_a are updated based on the value of a; block_b and floor_b are updated based on the value of b. If floor_a equals 1, time_to_exit is set to 0. Otherwise, time_to_exit is calculated as 10 + (floor_a - 1); direct_walk_time is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; reverse_walk_time is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.
