Example Answer:
`total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The value of `time_to_target_floor` was calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. Therefore, after execution, the `total_time` will be the sum of these three values.
Output State: **`time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`**
