Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input values for n, m, k, a, and b within the specified ranges. It then calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments. The code correctly determines the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering the time taken to move between blocks and floors. The calculations are in line with the problem description, and the provided examples also match the expected output. Therefore, the code seems to be correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
