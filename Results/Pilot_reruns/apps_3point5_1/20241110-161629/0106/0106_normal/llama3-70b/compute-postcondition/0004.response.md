Example Answer: 
`b_floor` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` is an input integer and `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The value of `m` is unknown, so the value of `b_floor` cannot be calculated precisely. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`**
