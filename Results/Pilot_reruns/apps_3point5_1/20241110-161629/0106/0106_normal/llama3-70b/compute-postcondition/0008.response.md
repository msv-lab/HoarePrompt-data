Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum time between two blocks, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`**
