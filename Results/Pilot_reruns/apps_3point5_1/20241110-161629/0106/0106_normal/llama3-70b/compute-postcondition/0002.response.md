Example Answer:
`a_floor` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` and `m` are input integers. The value of `a_floor` depends on the input values of `a` and `m`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`**
