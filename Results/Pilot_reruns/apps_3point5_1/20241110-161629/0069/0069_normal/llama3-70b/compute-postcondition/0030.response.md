Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n and x are assigned values based on user input, cnt0 and cnt1 are updated counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, s is the user input string. If balance is equal to x, then print n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, then print -1. Otherwise, print ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all scenarios including cases where division by zero or negative results might occur, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the program's behavior after execution.***
