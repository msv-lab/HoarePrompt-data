Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned values based on user input, s is assigned the user input value, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance == x, then n is incremented by 1 and printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This encompasses all scenarios where the program correctly processes the given input and provides the appropriate output.***
