Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `s` are based on user input, so the counts of '0' and '1' will depend on the user input string. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned values based on user input, s is assigned the user input value, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned values based on user input, s is assigned the user input value, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string**
