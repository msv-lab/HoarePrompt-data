Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function reads the input test cases and calculates the balance of 0s and 1s in the string `s`. It then determines the number of prefixes of the infinite string `t` with a balance equal to `x` as specified. The code handles the cases where the number of prefixes can be infinite and prints the correct output accordingly. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
