Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code and indicate that there can be cases where the code might not handle the logic correctly. Specifically, the code may not correctly handle cases where the balance of the prefix is 0 and the desired balance is in the prefix balances. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the balance is 0 and the desired balance is not in the prefix balances. These cases are not in line with the problem description, making the code incorrect.
