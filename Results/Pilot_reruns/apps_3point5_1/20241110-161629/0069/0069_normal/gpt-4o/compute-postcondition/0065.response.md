State: **data is a list with a length of at least index + 4 + 12, n is an integer value at index position + 3 + 12 in data, x is an integer value at index position + 4 + 12 in data, index is increased by another 12, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 + 12 where each element prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), and count is assigned the value 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0**
