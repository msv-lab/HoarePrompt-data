Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length greater than 1 based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count` is 1 if both ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied. After the execution of the if statement, if the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are met, `count` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships. Ensure all edge cases, including the boundaries of the conditions, are considered.***
