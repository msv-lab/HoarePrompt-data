Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length greater than 2 based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If both ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied, `count` is increased by 1. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes covers the scenario where `count` is incremented by 1 if the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) hold true.***
