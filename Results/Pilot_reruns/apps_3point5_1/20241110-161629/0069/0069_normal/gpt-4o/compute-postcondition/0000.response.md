Example Answer:
The `input` function reads input from the standard input (stdin). Since there are no other variables affected, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of 0-s and 1-s.**
