Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in the list. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is true, then `count` is increased by 1. This increment occurs under the condition that the result of the division between (x - b) and `balance` is a non-negative integer. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
