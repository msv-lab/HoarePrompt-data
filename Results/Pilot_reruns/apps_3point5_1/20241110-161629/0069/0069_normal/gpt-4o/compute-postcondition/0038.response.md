Example Answer: 
The value of `index` is unknown, but in order for the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least `index + 1` elements. `data` should be a list with a length of at least `index + 1`. If this condition is met, `n` is assigned the integer value at the `index` position of `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`**
