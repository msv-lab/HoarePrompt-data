Output State: **If n is at least 1, the loop will execute and print out the elements in the results list. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. If balance is 0 and x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to results, otherwise 0 is appended. If balance is not 0, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances that satisfy the conditions. If prefix_balances is empty or the conditions are not met for any element, count remains 0.**
