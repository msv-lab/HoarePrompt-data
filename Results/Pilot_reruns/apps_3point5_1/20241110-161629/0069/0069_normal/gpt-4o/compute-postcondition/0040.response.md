Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value at index position `index + 2` in the `data` list. The value of `index` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`**
