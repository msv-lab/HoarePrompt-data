According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, which means the loop has completed its iterations. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the length of `prefix_balances` needs to be increased by 1 to accommodate the new element.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 3` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), and each element is updated based on the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, where `i` is equal to `n + 2`**
