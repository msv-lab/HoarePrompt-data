Output State: If `n` is at least 1, after the loop executes, `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`, `n` is an integer value at index position + 3 in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`, `index` is increased by 6, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` where each element `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1). `x` is assigned the value of integer at `data[index + 1]`.
