Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of at least 1 based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `balance` is 0, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, an additional -1 is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, 0 is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` is not 0, for each valid `b` in `prefix_balances` where both ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) hold true, `count` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. The `results` list contains the appended value of `count`.***
