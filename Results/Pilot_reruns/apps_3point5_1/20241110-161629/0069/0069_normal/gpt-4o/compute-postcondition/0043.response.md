Example Answer:
`prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the integer value at the index position in `data`. The value of `n` is known but `x` and `index` are not utilized in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
Output State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
