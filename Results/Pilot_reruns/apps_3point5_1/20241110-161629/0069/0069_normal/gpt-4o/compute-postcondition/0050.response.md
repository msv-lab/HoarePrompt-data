According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the key states are as follows:
- `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`
- `n` is an integer value at index position + 5 in `data`
- `x` is an integer value at index position + 6 in `data`
- `index` is increased by 6
- `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` recalculated

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `index` needs to be increased by 6 again to reflect the increment for the next iteration
- `n` needs to be increased by 1 to allow for the next iteration to occur
- The calculation of `prefix_balances` needs to be updated based on the updated `n` value

State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`, `n` is an integer value at index position + 6 in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 7 in `data`, `index` is increased by 6, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` recalculated**
