Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the string $s$ and determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$ as per the problem description. It handles the case where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the current balance of the string $s$ is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in $s$. If it is not divisible, it calculates the number of prefixes accordingly. The logic seems to be correct for all potential cases.
