Output State: **T is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n and x are assigned values from the input, s is the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed.**
