According to the code, the loop will execute T times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance, cnt0, cnt1 are maintained. To execute the loop one more time, the value of T needs to be adjusted to T + 1.
State: **T + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance, cnt0, cnt1**
