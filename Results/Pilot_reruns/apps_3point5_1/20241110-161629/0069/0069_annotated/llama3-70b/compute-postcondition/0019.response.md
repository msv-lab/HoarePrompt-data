Postcondition: ***T, n, x are integers greater than or equal to 0. s is the input value. cnt0 is the count of '0' in s. cnt1 is the count of '1' in s. balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. Covers the case where the division is exact with a remainder of 0 as well as the case where the division produces a non-zero remainder.***
