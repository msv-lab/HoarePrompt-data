Example Answer: 
Initially, the values of the variables are unknown. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute and `results` will have `-1` appended to it. The other variables will be updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the variables will remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the value of `n`.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `n`**
