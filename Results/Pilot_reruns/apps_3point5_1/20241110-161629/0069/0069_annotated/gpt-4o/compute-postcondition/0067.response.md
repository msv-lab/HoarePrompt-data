Example Answer:
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The previous value of `count` is retained, and `results` will now contain the value of `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied and `results` contains the value of `count`.
Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied; `results` contains the value of `count`**
