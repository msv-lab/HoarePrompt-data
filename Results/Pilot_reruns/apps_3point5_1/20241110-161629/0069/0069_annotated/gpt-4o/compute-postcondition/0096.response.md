Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the next element in the `prefix_balances` list. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. This accounts for all possible scenarios considering the constraints of the variables involved.***
