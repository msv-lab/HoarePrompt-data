Postcondition: ***If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If balance is 0, then if x is present in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to results; otherwise, 0 is appended. If balance is not 0, count is the number of elements in prefix_balances for which the difference between x and the element is divisible by balance and the division is non-negative. If prefix_balances is empty, count is 0. The value of count is appended to results.***
