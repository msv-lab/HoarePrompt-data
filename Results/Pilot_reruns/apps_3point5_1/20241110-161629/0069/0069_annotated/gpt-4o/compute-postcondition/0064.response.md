Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of balances with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list. If the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. Ensure that all variables maintain their initial conditions.***
