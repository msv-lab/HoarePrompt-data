Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the new value of `count` is incremented by 1. This does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in the list.
Output State: **`count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in the list**
