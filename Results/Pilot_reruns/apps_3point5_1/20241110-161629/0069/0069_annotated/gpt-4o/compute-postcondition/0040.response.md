Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `data` is a list, `index` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2].
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2]**
