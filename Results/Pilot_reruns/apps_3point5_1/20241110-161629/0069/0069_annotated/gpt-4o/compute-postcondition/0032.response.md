Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. This incrementation occurs for all valid combinations of `x`, `b`, and `balance` that satisfy the condition.***
