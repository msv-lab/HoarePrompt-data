According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and become 4.
State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an integer + 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous element with 1 if the corresponding character in `s` is '0' and -1 if it's '1', `i` is 4, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated according to the expression `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
