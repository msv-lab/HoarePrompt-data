According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the `prefix_balances` list should still be non-empty and the loop variable `b` should move to the next element in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the next element in the `prefix_balances` list**
