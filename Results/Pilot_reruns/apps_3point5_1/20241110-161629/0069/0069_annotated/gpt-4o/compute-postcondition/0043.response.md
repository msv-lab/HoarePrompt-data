Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` of size `n + 1` is created, initialized with zeros. The variables `data`, `index`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list, `index` is an integer + 3, `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of size `n + 1`.
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an integer + 3, `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of size `n + 1`**
