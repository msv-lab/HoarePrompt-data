Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of integers and `index` is the current index. Since `index` is 0, `n` is assigned the value of the first element in the `data` list. The value of `T` is greater than 0, so there is at least one element in the `data` list. Therefore, `n` is assigned the first element of the list. The `results` list is still empty. 
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of the first element in the `data` list**
