Example Answer:
The input is split into a list named `data`. The list `data` will contain the elements as strings. No specific variable is mentioned to be affected, so the output state will be: T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string s, x is an integer representing the desired balance such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9. The binary string s consists of 0s and 1s, and the total sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Output State: **T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
