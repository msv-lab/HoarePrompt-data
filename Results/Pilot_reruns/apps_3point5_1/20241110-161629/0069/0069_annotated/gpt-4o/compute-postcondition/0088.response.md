According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
