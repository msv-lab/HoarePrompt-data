Example Answer:
The value of `r_index` is added to `n` and then appended to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is unknown, but the length of `r_queue` increases by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` may be empty or have some indices, `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R', `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the index of the first employee who voted 'R' and the length of `r_queue` increases by 1.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` may be empty or have some indices, `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R', `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the index of the first employee who voted 'R' and the length of `r_queue` increases by 1**
