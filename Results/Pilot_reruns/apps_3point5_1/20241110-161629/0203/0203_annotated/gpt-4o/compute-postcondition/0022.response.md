Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index` is incremented by `n` and added to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_index` remains unchanged and the length of `r_queue` increases by 1. `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R'.***
