Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, and the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then the value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, the value `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.***
