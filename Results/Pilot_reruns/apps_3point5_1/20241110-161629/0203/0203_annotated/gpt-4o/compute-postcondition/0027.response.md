Example Answer: 
`r_index` is appended to `r_queue` after adding `n` to it. The length of `r_queue` decreases by 1. The previous values of `n`, `votes`, and `r_index` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1**
