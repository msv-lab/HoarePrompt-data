According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then the value `d_index + n` should be appended to `d_queue`.
2. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, then the value `r_index + n` should be appended to `r_queue`.

State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the conditions mentioned above.**
