Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n. If the second character in the `votes` string is 'D', then `d_queue` contains 0 based on the first character in the `votes` string and `i` is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1. If the second character is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains 0 based on the first character in the `votes` string and `i` is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1. In all cases, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will have values based on the conditions specified in the `votes` string, and `i` will be updated accordingly.***
