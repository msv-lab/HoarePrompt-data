Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input value after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input represents the votes of 'D' (Democrats) and 'R' (Republicans) for each employee. The length of the string is equal to the number of employees represented by `n`, a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
