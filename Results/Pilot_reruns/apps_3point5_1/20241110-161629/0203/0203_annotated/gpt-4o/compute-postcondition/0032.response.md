Example Answer:
`d_index` is appended to `d_queue` after adding `n` to it. The value of `d_index` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`**
