Postcondition: ***If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty initially, the loop will execute and after its execution, one of the queues will be empty based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The values in `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be appropriately updated based on the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index`. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and their values will remain unchanged.***
