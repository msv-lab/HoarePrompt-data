Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` either decreases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue`, or increases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `r_queue` based on the conditions mentioned above. `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`. The postcondition covers all edge cases where `d_index` is less than `r_index` and where `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.***
