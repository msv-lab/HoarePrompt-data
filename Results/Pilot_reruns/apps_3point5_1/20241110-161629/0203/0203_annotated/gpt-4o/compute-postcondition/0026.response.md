Example Answer:
The value `d_index + n` is appended to the `d_queue`. The length of `d_queue` increases by 1, and the value `r_index` is popped from the `r_queue`, decreasing its length by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`**
