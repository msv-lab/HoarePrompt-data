The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the total number of employees and a string `fractions` containing 'D' and 'R' characters representing the fractions of employees. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the input string and prints 'D' if the number of 'D' fractions is greater than the number of 'R' fractions; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not have an explicit return value and operates based on the provided inputs.
