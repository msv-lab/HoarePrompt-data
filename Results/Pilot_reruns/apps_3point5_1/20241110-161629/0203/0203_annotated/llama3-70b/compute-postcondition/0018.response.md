Output State: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by the total number of 'D' fractions in the input string, and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by the total number of non-'D' fractions in the input string. In both cases, `fraction` remains the last fraction processed in `fractions`. If the input string does not contain any 'D' or non-'D' fractions, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.
