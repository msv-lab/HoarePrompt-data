Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user. If the input string contains 'D' fractions, `depublicans` is incremented by the total number of 'D' fractions, and `remocrats` remains 0. If the input string contains non-'D' fractions, `remocrats` is incremented by the total number of non-'D' fractions. In both cases, `fraction` stores the last processed fraction. If the input string does not contain any 'D' or non-'D' fractions, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. After the if-else block executes, the program prints 'D' if the number of 'D' fractions is greater than the number of non-'D' fractions (depublicans > remocrats), otherwise it prints 'R'. The overall state of the program post-execution includes the updated values of `n`, `fractions`, `depublicans`, `remocrats`, and `fraction` based on the described logic.***
