Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`. If `n` is 0, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. After the loop executes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will contain the remaining indices of 'D' or 'R' in `votes`, respectively, and `d_index` and `r_index` will hold the values of the last popped indices. If `d_queue` is empty, the loop will end, if `r_queue` is empty, the loop will also end.
**If d_queue is empty after the loop, d_queue is empty, r_queue contains the remaining indices of 'R', d_index holds the value of the last popped 'D' index, r_index holds the value of the last popped 'R' index. If r_queue is empty after the loop, r_queue is empty, d_queue contains the remaining indices of 'D', d_index holds the value of the last popped 'D' index, r_index holds the value of the last popped 'R' index. If both queues are empty after the loop, both d_queue and r_queue are empty, d_index and r_index hold the values of the last popped 'D' and 'R' indices, respectively. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty.**
