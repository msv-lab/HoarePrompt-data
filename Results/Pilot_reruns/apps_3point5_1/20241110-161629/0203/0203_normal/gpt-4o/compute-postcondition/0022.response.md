Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`. If `n` is 0, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. After the if else block executes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is appended with the value of `(d_index + n)` or `(r_index + n)` respectively based on the comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`.***
