According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the index `i` is less than the length of the `votes` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `v` is the second character in the `votes` string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next index.
2. Update `v` to be the character at the next index in the `votes` string.
3. If the updated `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` should contain [0]. If the updated `v` is 'R', then `r_queue` should contain [0].

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `v` is the character at the third index in the `votes` string. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [0]. If `v` is 'R', then `r_queue` contains [0].**
