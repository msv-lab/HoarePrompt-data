Postcondition: ***Output State: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` with the new appended value if `d_index` < `r_index`, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes` with the new appended value if `d_index` >= `r_index`, and `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`. If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` with the new appended value of `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `d_index` >= `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes` with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, and `r_index` remains unchanged. `d_index` is the first index popped from `d_queue`. After executing the code, `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue` and the variables maintain their respective states.***
