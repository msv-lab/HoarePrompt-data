Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`. The value of `r_index` is unknown, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the output state is: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`, and `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`, `r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`.
Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`, `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`**
