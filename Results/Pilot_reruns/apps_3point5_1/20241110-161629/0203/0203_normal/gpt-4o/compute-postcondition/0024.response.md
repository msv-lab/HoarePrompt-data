Example Answer: 
The code pops the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The value of `d_index` is the index of 'D' in `votes`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`.
Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`**
