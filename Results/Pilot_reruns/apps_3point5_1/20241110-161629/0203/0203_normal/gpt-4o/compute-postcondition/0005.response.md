Example Answer:
`i` is added to the end of the `d_queue` list. The previous values are `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string, and `i` is added to the `d_queue` list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string, `i` is added to the `d_queue` list**
