Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, after the execution of the if else block, if d_queue is empty, d_queue will be empty, r_queue will contain the remaining indices of 'R', d_index will hold the value of the last popped 'D' index, and r_index will hold the value of the last popped 'R' index. If r_queue is empty, r_queue will be empty, d_queue will contain the remaining indices of 'D', d_index will hold the value of the last popped 'D' index, and r_index will hold the value of the last popped 'R' index. If both queues are empty, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index and r_index will hold the values of the last popped 'D' and 'R' indices, respectively. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty.***
