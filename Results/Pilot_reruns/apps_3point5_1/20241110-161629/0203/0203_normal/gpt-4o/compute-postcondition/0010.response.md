Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `r_queue`, where `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains 0**
