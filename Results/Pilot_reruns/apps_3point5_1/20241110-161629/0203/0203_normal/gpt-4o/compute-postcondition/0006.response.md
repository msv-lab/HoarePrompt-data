Example Answer:
The value of `i` (which is 0) is appended to the list `r_queue`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains 0**
