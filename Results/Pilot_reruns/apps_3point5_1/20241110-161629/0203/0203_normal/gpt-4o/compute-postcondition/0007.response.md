Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string. If the first character in `votes` is 'D', then `i` is added to the `d_queue` list. Otherwise, if the first character is 'R', `i` is added to the `r_queue` list.***
