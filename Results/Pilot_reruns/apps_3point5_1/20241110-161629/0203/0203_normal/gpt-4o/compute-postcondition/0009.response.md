Example Answer:
`i` is added to the end of the list `d_queue`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `d_queue` is initially empty, after execution, `d_queue` will contain [0]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string, `d_queue` contains [0].
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string, `d_queue` contains [0]**
