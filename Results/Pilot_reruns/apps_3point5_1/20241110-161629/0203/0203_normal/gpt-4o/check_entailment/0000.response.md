Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description accurately. It considers the voting process step by step, ensuring that employees who are denied the right to vote do not participate in the subsequent rounds. The code correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining eligible voters. Additionally, the output hints align with the code, confirming that it handles cases where both parties have equal votes and outputs the winning party based on the minimum number of vote changes needed. Overall, the code is correct and functions as expected.
