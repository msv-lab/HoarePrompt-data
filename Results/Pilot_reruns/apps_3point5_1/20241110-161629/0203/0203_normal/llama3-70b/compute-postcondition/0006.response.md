Example Answer:
The value of `remocrats` is increased by 1. The previous values of the variables are `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the `fractions` list. After execution, the new state is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the `fractions` list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, `fraction` is the first fraction in the `fractions` list**
