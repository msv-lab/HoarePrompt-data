Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `depublicans` was not specified, the new value of `depublicans` will be 1, and `remocrats` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
