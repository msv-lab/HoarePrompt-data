Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the number of employees and their fractions.
- It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' fractions.
- Finally, it prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'.
- The voting process is accurately represented in the code as described in the problem description.
- The code handles all possible scenarios of employee statements and voting outcomes, leading to the correct determination of the winning fraction.
