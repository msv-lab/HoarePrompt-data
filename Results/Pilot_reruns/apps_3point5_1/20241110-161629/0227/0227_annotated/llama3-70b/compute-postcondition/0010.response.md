According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2. Since the loop starts at 1, `i` will be 1 at the beginning of the next iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` should be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3**
