Example Answer: 
`m` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2**
