Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input values split by spaces to integers. The input is taken as a list of integers separated by spaces. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input**
