The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers. It sorts the list and then iterates through the elements to count how many do not satisfy the condition `a[i] = a[i - 1] * 2`. The function then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.
