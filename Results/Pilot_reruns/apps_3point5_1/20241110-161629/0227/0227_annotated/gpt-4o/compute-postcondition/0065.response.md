Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It iterates over the elements in `a` to determine the count of elements that cannot be formed by a pair of assigned elements. It also identifies elements in `a` that can be formed by a pair and indicates if each element can be formed by a pair in the assigned elements. The function returns the count of unpairable elements. **

The function functionality does not explicitly mention handling invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `a` not being a list, or `a` containing non-integer values. This missing functionality could lead to unexpected behavior and should be addressed to ensure robustness and accuracy in the function.
