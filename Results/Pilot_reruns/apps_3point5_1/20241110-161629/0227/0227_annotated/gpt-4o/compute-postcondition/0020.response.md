Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if a[i] - x is found in `assigned`, otherwise False. The loop terminates after setting `can_form` to True and breaking out of the loop. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False.**
