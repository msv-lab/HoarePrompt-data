Example Answer:
The variable `assigned` is assigned an empty set. Since `assigned` is a new variable, the previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is an empty set.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is an empty set**
