Postcondition: ***`assigned` is not empty. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, including when `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. The value of `m` is not changed, and `x` is updated to the next element in `assigned`.***
