According to the code, the loop can continue executing if `can_form` remains False. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 4 elements of `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `x` is the third element of `assigned`. To execute one more time, `can_form` needs to be False. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 4 elements of `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is False, `x` is the third element of `assigned`**
