Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first two elements of `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2 based on the condition, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. The program will exit the loop or if statement after setting `can_form` to True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.***
