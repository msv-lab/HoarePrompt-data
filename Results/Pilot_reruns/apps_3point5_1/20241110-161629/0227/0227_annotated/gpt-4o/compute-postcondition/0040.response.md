Postcondition: ***If `assigned` contains at least one element and `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, the loop breaks, and `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False, and `m` is not changed. The loop will not execute and `can_form` will remain False if `assigned` is empty or `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`.***
