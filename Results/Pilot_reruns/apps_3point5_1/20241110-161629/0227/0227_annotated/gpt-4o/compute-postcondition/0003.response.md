Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value 1. The value of `m` is now 1, and the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, and `m` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, and `m` is 1**
