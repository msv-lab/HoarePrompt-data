Correctness: **False**

The code provided is incorrect. The logic in the code does not match the problem description for every potential case. The code does not correctly determine the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations.

An example where the code fails to provide the correct output is as follows:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

The expected output is -1 because it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations with the given sequence of numbers. However, the code will output 2 for this input, which is incorrect.

The annotations in the code do not accurately reflect the logic implemented in the code. The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect outputs.
