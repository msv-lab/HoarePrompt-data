Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is directly assigned the boolean value `True`, so the value of `can_form` is set to True. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`assigned` contains more than two elements, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True**
