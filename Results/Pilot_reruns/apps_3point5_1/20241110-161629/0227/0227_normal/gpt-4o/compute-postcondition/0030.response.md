Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since this assignment does not affect the initial state variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+2' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 1, and there are still elements left in the `assigned` list**
