According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `a[i] - x` being found in `assigned` is not satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the first 'm+3' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `m` is either 2 or 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`. 
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `assigned` after the current `x`. 
State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+3' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `m` is either 2 or 3, `x` is the third element in `assigned`**
