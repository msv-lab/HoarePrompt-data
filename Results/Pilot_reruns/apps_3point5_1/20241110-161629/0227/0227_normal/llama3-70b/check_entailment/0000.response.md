Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input integers and sorts them.
- It then iterates through the list to find the longest increasing subsequence where each element is twice the previous element.
- The code correctly calculates the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations.
- The code handles the case where the sequence cannot be performed by outputting -1.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
- Therefore, the code is correct.
