Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of `n` and the elements in the list `a` are unknown. After sorting, the list `a` is rearranged in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
