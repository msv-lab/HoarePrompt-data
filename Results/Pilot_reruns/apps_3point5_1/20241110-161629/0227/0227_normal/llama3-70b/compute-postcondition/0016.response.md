The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The function should adhere to the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given sequence of positive integers, while considering the constraints on the input parameters.
