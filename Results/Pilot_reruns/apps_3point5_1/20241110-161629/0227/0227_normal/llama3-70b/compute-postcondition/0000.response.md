Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. Since the input is constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 23, the output state is: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence.** 
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence.**
