Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence of numbers and then iterates through the list to check if each number can be generated from the previous number by multiplying it by 2. If not, it increments the count of variables needed. The program then prints the minimum number of variables required or -1 if it exceeds 23. The logic is sound and the program produces the correct output for the given problem description.
