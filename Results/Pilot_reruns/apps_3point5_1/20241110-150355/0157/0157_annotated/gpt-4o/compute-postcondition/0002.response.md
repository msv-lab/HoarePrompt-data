Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial states of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
