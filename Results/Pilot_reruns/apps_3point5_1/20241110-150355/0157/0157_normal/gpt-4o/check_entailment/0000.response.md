Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay has.
- It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. This ensures that Nikolay maintains the 1:2:4 ratio for the compote.
- Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons with 1, 2, and 4.
- Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote.
