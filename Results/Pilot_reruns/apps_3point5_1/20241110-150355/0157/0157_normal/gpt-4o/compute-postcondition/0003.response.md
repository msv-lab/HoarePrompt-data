Example Answer:
The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The maximum number of lemons that can be bought is limited by the least available resource among the capacity of the bag (`b // 2` lemons) and the capacity of the cart (`c // 4` lemons), and the maximum number of lemons available (`a`). Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b // 2, c // 4.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b // 2, c // 4**
