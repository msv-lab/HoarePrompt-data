Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It calculates the minimum amount of fruit Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the ratios given in the problem description (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). It then calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote by multiplying the minimum value by 1, 2, and 4, respectively.

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases:
1. If Nikolay has enough lemons, apples, and pears to follow the 1:2:4 ratio, the code will calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote.
2. If Nikolay does not have enough of any one type of fruit to follow the ratio, the code will correctly output 0, indicating that Nikolay cannot cook the compote.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
