According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, and `dp[n, k]` is updated**
