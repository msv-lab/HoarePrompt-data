According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the values of n, k, and dp do not guarantee the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the values need to be adjusted to `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `dp` is a dictionary with dp[n, k] = 9.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary with dp[n, k] = 9**
