Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if the pair (n, k) is already present in `dp`, then the function returns the value stored in `dp` corresponding to the pair (n, k). Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `k`, and `dp`. If n is less than 10 ** k, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If k is 0, the function returns 0. If k is 1, dp[n, k] is 9. Otherwise, after the loop executes, dp[n, k] is updated based on the provided formula, where i is less than k and dp[n, k] is updated accordingly.***
