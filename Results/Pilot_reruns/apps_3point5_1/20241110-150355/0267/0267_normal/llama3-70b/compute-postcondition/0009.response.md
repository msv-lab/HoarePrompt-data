Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are used in the calculation. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is less than `k`, and `dp[n, k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is less than `k`, and `dp[n, k]` is updated**
