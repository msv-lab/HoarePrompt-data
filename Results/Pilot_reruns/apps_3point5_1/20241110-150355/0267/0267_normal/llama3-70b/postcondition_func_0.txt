The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k` within the specified constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the result of the subtraction of the count of values less than or equal to `r` divisible by `k` minus the count of values less than `l` divisible by `k`, all modulo some constant MOD. The function relies on a helper function `count` which is not explicitly defined in the given code. However, the code should include the implementation of the `count` function to correctly calculate the final result.
