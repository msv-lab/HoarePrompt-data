Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the function `func_1` which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
- The function `count` correctly calculates the count of values less than or equal to `n` divisible by `k`.
- The code handles the edge cases specified in the problem description (1 <= l <= r < 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10).
- The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of how the functions work.
- The examples provided in the problem description are valid and the code correctly calculates the sum for those examples.
