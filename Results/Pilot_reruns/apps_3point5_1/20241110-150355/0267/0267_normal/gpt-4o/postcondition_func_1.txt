The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It iterates through numbers in the range [l, r], checks if they satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, and updates the total sum accordingly by taking the modulo MOD. The function returns the final total sum of numbers that meet the condition. If l > r, the function returns 0. If l = r, it evaluates `func_1(l, k)` once to determine the total sum.
