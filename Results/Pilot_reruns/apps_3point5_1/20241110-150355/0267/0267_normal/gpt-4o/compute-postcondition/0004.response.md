According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. If the current number `num` is within this range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18. This means that the current number `num` is within the specified range. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next number `num` should be considered. Since the loop is iterating over consecutive numbers, the next number after `num` will be `num + 1`. Therefore, the new state should reflect the next number in the range.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true, where `num` is equal to `l + 1`**
