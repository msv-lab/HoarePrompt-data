Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is an integer. Then `total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The values of `total_sum` and `num` are affected, but the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true, where `num` is equal to `l + 1.
Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true, where `num` is equal to `l + 1**.
