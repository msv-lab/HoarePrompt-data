Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum` and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Since `num` is equal to `l`, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated according to the mentioned formula, `num` is equal to `l`**
