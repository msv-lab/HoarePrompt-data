Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` which are used to check if a number contains at most `k` different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` meeting the condition, respectively.
2. The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number contains at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to eliminate duplicate digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
3. The `func_2` function iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and adds the numbers meeting the condition to the `total_sum` variable, taking the modulus `MOD` after each addition to prevent overflow.
4. The program then reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result, which is the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` meeting the condition modulo `998244353`.
5. The program handles the given constraints and accurately calculates the sum of numbers meeting the condition for all potential cases within the constraints.
