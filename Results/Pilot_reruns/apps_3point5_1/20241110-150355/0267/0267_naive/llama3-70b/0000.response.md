Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.

The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a recursive approach to count the numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most $k$ different digits.

The function calculates the count of valid numbers in the range $[l, r]$ by subtracting the count of valid numbers in the range $[1, l-1]$ from the count of valid numbers in the range $[1, r]$.

Since the implementation uses a recursive approach and memoization to store intermediate results, it ensures efficiency in calculating the result for large values of $l$ and $r$.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
