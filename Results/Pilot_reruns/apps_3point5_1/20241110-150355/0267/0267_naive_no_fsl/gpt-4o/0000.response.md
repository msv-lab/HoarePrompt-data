Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `func_1` which checks if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting it to a string and checking the length of the set of digits.
2. The program correctly defines a function `func_2` which iterates through the numbers in the range `[l, r]` and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits to the total sum.
3. The program correctly calculates the total sum modulo `998244353` and prints the result. 
4. The program follows the problem description for all possible cases as specified in the input constraints.
