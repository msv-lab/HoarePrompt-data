You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    #State of the program here: `dp` is an empty dictionary
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the return statement: `dp` is an empty dictionary
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k and calculates the result of the subtraction of the count function applied to the values of r and l-1 with k, utilizing an empty dictionary dp. The result is then taken modulo MOD.

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #State of the program after the return statement: Precondition: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table. The function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: Precondition: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table. The function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of n, k, and dp after the execution of the program fragment.
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #State of the program after the return statement: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table. If the tuple (n, k) is present in dp, then the function returns the corresponding value from dp. Otherwise, no changes are made to n, k, and dp.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
        #State of the program here: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        #State of the program here: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table with the tuple (n, k) having a value of 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If k is greater than 1, then after the loop executes, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value calculated based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i is the value that the loop ends with. If k is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and dp retains its initial value of 9.
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        #State of the program here: If k is greater than 1, then dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value calculated based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i is the value that the loop ends with. If k is 1 or less, dp retains its initial value of 9.
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
        #State of the program here: If k is greater than 1, then dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value calculated based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i is the value that the loop ends with. If k is 1 or less, dp retains its initial value of 9.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: If k is greater than 1, then dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value calculated based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i is the value that the loop ends with. If k is 1 or less, dp retains its initial value of 9.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table. If n < 10
    return dp[n, k]
    #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary representing the memoization table
#Overall this is what the function does:
Functionality: The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer; `k`, a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10; and `dp`, a dictionary representing a memoization table. It first checks if k equals 0 and returns 0 in that case. Then, it looks for the tuple (n, k) in the memoization table dp. If found, it returns the corresponding value. If not found, it calculates the value based on certain conditions and stores it in dp. Finally, it returns the value associated with (n, k) in dp. The function's purpose is to provide a calculated value based on n, k, and dp for different scenarios, ensuring proper memoization.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
