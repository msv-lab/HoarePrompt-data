Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table. If n < 10 ** k, dp[(n, k)] is set to the value of n. Otherwise, dp[(n, k)] is updated according to a series of calculations involving n, k, and i. If k is greater than 1, dp[(n, k)] is modified based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i represents the loop index. If k is 1 or less, dp[(n, k)] retains its initial value of 9. The final value of dp[(n, k)] is calculated based on the conditions mentioned in the if else block, covering all edge cases and ensuring the proper state of the program variables after execution.***
