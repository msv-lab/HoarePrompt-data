According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 999999999, i is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 999999999, i is 2**
