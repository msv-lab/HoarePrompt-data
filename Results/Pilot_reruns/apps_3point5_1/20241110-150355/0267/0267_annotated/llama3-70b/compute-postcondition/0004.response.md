Example Answer:
The key (n, k) is assigned the value of n in the memoization table dp. If the tuple (n, k) is already present in dp, then the function returns that value. Otherwise, the key (n, k) is added to dp with the corresponding value of n. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing the memoization table**
