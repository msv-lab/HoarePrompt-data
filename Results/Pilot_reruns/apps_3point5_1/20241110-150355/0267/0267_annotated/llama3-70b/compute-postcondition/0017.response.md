Example Answer:
The function returns the value stored in the memoization table `dp` at key `(n, k)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and `dp` is a dictionary representing the memoization table. If `n` is less than 10, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary representing the memoization table.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary representing the memoization table**
