Example Answer:
The function returns the value stored in the dictionary `dp` at key (n, k). No changes are made to the state of n, k, and dp after the execution of this program fragment. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary representing memoization table**
