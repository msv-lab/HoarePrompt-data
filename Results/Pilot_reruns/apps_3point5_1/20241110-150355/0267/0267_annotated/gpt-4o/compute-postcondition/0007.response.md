According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This means the loop will execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **total_sum is updated based on the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD, num is equal to l, and l is less than or equal to r.**
