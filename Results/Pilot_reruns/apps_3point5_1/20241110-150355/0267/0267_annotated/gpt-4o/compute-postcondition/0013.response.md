The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function updates the `total_sum` based on a given formula and conditions. If `l` is greater than `r`, the `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns the final `total_sum` value after processing the input parameters according to the specified constraints and formula.
