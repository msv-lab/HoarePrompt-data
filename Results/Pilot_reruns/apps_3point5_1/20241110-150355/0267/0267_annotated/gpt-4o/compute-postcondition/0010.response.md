According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop will execute again if `num` is less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, `r` are all integers. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r`**
