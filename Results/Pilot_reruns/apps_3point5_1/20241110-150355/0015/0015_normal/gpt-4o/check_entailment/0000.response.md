Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers from the input and checks conditions to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the relationship between the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES', which follows the problem description.
- If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO', which is also in line with the problem description.
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', as expected based on the problem description.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
