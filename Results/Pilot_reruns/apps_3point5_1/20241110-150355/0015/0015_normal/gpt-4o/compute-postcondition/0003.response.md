Example Answer: 
The code prints 'YES' to the console. The variables a, b, and c are integers obtained from splitting the input, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input, and the program prints 'YES'.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input, and the program prints 'YES'**
