Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. This guarantees that the program handles scenarios where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, leading to the output 'YES'. For all other cases, including when the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO', ensuring comprehensive coverage of the potential outcomes.***
