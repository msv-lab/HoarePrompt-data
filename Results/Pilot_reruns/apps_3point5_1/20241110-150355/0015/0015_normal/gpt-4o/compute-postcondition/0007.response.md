Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES', ensuring coverage of scenarios where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. For all other cases, including when the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO', providing a comprehensive overview of the potential outcomes.***
