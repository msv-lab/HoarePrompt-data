Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers from the input and then checks conditions to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the relationship between the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, as it reads input within the function.**
