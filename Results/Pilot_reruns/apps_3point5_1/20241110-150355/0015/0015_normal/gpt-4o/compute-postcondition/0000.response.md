Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown until input is provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
