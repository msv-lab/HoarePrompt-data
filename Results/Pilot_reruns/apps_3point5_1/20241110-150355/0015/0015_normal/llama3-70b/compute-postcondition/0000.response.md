Example Answer:
`a, b, c` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `a, b, c` can be any integers within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
