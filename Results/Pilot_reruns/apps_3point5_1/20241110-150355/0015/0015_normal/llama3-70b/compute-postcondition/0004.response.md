Example Answer:
The code snippet does not affect the values of variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` remain integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` remain integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
