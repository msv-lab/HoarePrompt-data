Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values as extracted from the input. If c is equal to 0, the code prints 'YES' if a is equal to b; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, the code prints 'YES' if the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios based on the input values of a, b, and c, ensuring a clear understanding of the program's behavior.***
