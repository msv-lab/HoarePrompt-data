Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values extracted by splitting the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now known based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values as extracted from the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values as extracted from the input**
