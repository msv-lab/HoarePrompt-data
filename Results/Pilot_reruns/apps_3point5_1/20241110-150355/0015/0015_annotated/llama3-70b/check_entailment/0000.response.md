Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the problem description, the provided Python program, and the annotations, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately determines whether Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence `s` based on the conditions provided. The program covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description:
1. If the difference (`c`) between neighboring elements is 0, the program checks if the first element (`a`) is equal to Vasya's favorite number (`b`). If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the difference (`c`) between neighboring elements is not 0, the program calculates whether Vasya's favorite number (`b`) can be reached from the first element (`a`) by adding multiples of the difference (`c`). If this condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The annotations provide clarity on the state of the program at different stages and explain the decision-making process behind printing 'YES' or 'NO'. The program handles all possible scenarios correctly, making it align with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
