Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Upon reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the problem description. The program first reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. It then checks if `b` is equal to `a` and prints 'YES' in that case. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it further checks if `c` is 0 and prints 'NO' if that condition is met. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied. If the condition holds true, it prints 'YES', indicating that `b` appears in the sequence based on the defined properties. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES', which aligns with the requirement that Vasya's favorite integer is the first element of the sequence.
2. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO', as specified in the problem description.
3. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not 0, the program checks if `b` can appear in the sequence based on the difference between `b` and `a`. It handles cases where the difference is evenly divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, printing 'YES'. For all other cases, including when the division result is negative or the difference is not divisible by `c`, 'NO' is printed.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and covers all potential cases, making the correctness **True**. The annotations were helpful in understanding the flow of the program and the conditions being checked, but the actual code implementation aligns with the problem description accurately.
