Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program handles cases where the difference between `b` and `a` is evenly divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, printing 'YES'. For all other cases, including when the division result is negative or the difference is not divisible by `c`, 'NO' is printed.***
