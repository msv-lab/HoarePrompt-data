Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is evenly divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. In all other cases where the conditions are not met, 'NO' is printed. The program handles various edge cases, ensuring a comprehensive output based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` after the execution of the if else block.***
