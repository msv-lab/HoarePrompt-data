Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input string and iterates through each character of the alphabet, replacing occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. If the resulting string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order, it prints the result, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program seems correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
