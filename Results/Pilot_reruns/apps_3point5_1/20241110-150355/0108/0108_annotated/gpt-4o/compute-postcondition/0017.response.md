Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of the variable `target`. The other variables `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains all characters in `target` in the same order, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is 26. If not, `i` is the length of `s` or `j` is the target length, whichever is reached first.
Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in `target` in the same order, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is 26. If not, `i` is the length of `s` or `j` is the target length, whichever is reached first.**
