According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`, and the lengths of `s` and `target_len`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 3, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `s` and `j` should be less than the length of `target`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 3, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target`**
