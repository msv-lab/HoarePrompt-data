According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 4 and `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `s` minus 4 and `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` minus 4, `j` is less than `target_len`**
