Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` is the length of `s` and `j` is 26. If `s` does not contain all characters in `target` in the same order, then either `i` is the length of `s` or `j` is the target length, whichever is reached first. After the execution of the if else block, the program prints the target if `j` is equal to target length, otherwise it prints -1.***
