Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is between 0 and 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. The state of the program after the execution includes the updated values of `j` based on the comparison between the characters in `s` and `target`.***
