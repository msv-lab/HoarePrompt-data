Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads a string `s` and checks if it contains all characters in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the same order. If it does, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', otherwise it prints -1. The code uses a while loop to iterate through `s` and `target`, checking if the characters match in order. If all characters match, it prints the target string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description provided. The annotations also accurately describe the flow of the program and confirm that it is correctly implemented.
