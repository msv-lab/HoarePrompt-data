Example Answer: 
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The value of `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, so the first occurrence of that character is replaced with the next character in the alphabet. After execution, `res` will have the next character in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` will have the first character removed, and `char` will be updated to the next character in `alphabet`.
Output State: **`res` has the next character in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first character removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`**
