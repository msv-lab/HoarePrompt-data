Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`. Since `char` represents the first character in `alphabet` that is different than 'b' in string `s`, `char` will be added to `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the original string with the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b', `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is updated by adding the first character in `alphabet` where the first character in `alphabet` is different than 'b' in string `s`.
Output State: **`s` has the original string with the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b', `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is updated by adding the first character in `alphabet` where the first character in `alphabet` is different than 'b' in string `s`**
