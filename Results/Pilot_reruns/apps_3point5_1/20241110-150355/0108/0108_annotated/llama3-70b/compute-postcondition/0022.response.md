Example Answer: 
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The values of `res`, `alphabet`, and `char` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` has the next four characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and `char` is in `s`**
