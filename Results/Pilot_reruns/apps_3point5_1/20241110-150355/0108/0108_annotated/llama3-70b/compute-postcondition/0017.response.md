According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has the next character in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first character removed, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` has the next character in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first character removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`**
