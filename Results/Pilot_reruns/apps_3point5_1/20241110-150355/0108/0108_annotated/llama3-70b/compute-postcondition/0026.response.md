Example Answer:
The character `char` is concatenated to the string `res`. The `char` is the next lowercase English letter in the alphabet after the last processed one. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `res` contains at least one character from 'alphabet', 'alphabet' has at least one unprocessed lowercase English letter, 'char' is the next character in 'alphabet' after the last processed one.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one character from 'alphabet', 'alphabet' has at least one unprocessed lowercase English letter, 'char' is the next character in 'alphabet' after the last processed one**
