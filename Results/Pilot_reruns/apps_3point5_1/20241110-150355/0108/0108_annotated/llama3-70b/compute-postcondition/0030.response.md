Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The `ord` function gets the ASCII value of the character, increments it by 1, and then converts it back to a character using the `chr` function. The `replace` function then replaces the first occurrence of `char` with this new character. The rest of the string remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the added character `char`.
Output State: **`res` contains the added character `char`**
