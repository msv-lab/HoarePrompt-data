Example Answer: 
The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. Since `char` contains the added characters `charchar`, the first occurrence of `char` in `s` will be replaced with the character that comes after `c` in the ASCII sequence, which is `d`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be `dhar`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`res` contains the added characters `charchar`, `s` is `dhar`**
