Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an input string 's' and a target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It then iterates through the input string and checks if it contains all the letters of the target string in order. If it does, it prints out the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. 

The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It checks if the input string contains all the letters of the alphabet in order and prints the target string if it does. If the input string is shorter than the alphabet or does not contain all the letters in order, it prints -1. 

The code and the problem description align perfectly, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
