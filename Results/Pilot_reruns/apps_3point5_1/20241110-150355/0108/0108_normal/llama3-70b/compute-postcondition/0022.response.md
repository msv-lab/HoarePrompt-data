Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'char' in 's' with the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char'. 'char' is the last replaced letter, so it will be updated to the new value in 's'. The 'alphabet' variable remains unchanged. The replaced 'char' values are concatenated in 'res'. 
Output State: **'s' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
