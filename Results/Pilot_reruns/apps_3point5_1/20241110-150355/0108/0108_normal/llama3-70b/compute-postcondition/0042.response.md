Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It then iterates through the alphabet, replacing each character in `s` with its next alphabetical letter while concatenating the replaced characters into a string `res`. If the length of `res` becomes 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any specific output. **
