Example Answer: 
'res' is concatenated with 'char', where 'char' is the last replaced letter in 's'. The previous values of 'res', 's', and 'char' are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: If 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'.
Output State: **If 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
