Example Answer: 
`res` is concatenated with `char`, which is 'a'. After execution, `res` will be 'aa'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with 'bar' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'bar' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
