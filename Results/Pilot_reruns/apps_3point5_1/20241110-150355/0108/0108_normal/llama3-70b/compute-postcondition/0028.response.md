According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables 'char' and 's'. If 'char' is present in 's', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **If 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
