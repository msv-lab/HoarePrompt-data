Output State: 
If 's' is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. The loop will replace each character in 's' with its next alphabetical letter, concatenating the replaced characters in 'res'. 'char' will be the last replaced letter in 's'. If 's' is empty, the loop does not execute. In both cases, 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
**If 's' is not empty, 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced characters in 's', 's' contains the updated string after replacements, 'char' is the last replaced letter. If 's' is empty, 'res' is empty, 's' remains unchanged, 'char' is 'a'**
