Example Answer:
The character 'a' in the string `s` is replaced with the character 'b' by using the `replace` method with a maximum of 1 replacement. The string `s` now becomes 'bbr'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 'bbr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is 'bbr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
