Example Answer:
The value of 'char' is added to the end of 'res'. Since 'char' is the last replaced letter in the updated 's', it represents the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char'. Therefore, 'res' will contain all the replaced 'char' values in order. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **'s' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter and 'char' is in the updated 's'**
