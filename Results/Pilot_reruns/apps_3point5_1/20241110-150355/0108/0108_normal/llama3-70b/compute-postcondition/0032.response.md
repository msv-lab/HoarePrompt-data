Example Answer:
The value of 'char' is appended to the end of 'res' using concatenation. The updated 'res' now contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order. The state of 's' is also affected as the last replaced letter 'char' is updated in 's'. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'char' is present in the updated 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'.
Output State: **If 'char' is present in the updated 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
