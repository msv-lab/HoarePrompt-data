Example Answer: 
The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. Since no value is assigned to `res` based on the given code snippet, the value of `res` remains an empty string. The states of `s` and `alphabet` are not affected by the code snippet.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string**
