Postcondition: ***If 's' is not empty, 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced characters in 's', 's' contains the updated string after replacements, 'char' is the last replaced letter. If 's' is empty, 'res' is empty, 's' remains unchanged, 'char' is 'a'. If the length of 'res' is 26, the function prints 'res', otherwise it prints -1.***
