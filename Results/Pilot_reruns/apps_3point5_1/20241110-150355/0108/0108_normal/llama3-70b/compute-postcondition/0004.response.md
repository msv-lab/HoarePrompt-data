Example Answer: 
`res` is concatenated with `char`, where `char` is 'a'. After execution, `res` will be 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
