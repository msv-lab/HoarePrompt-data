Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through the input string `s` and tries to match it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' by incrementing the index `j` of the target string whenever a match is found. If the program successfully matches the entire target string, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic ensures that the output will either be the target string or -1 as required by the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if it is possible to obtain the target string as a subsequence.
