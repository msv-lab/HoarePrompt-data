Correctness: **False**

The code does not entirely follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` does not handle cases where the number of cube faces is less than the number of digits provided, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if Masha has only one cube with digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the function may incorrectly return True for the number 45, even though it's not possible to form 45 with a single cube. This inconsistency indicates that the code may not always produce the correct output as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
