Functionality: The function `can_form_number` accepts a list of integers `num` and iterates through the elements of the list. It checks if the corresponding cube face can be used and if the digit is present on that cube face. If a suitable cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True. If no suitable cube face is found for any digit, the function returns False. 

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `num` is an empty list, the function will not execute the loop and will return False.
- If the loop does not start due to `n` (number of cube faces) being 0, the function will not execute the loop and will return False.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the number of cube faces is less than the number of digits provided in `num`. This could lead to unexpected behavior and should be addressed for full functionality coverage.
