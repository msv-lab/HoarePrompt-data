Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the first element set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first character in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[i]` is True if the condition in the if statement is met. If the condition in the if statement is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial conditions and relationships.***
