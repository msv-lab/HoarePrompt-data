According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values, `digit` is the first character in the list, and `found` is `False`.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values, `digit` is the first character in the list, `found` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
