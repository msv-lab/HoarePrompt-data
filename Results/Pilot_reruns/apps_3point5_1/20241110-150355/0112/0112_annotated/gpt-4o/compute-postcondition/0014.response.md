According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the first element set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first character in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is True if the condition in the if statement is met.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `used_cubes[i]` should be True if the condition in the if statement is met for the next iteration.
- No other states need adjustment.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the first element set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first character in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[i]` is True if the condition in the if statement is met.**
