According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values, suggesting that the loop can execute as long as `digits` has at least 1 character. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character and `digit` is the first character in the list.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values, `digit` is the first character in the list**
