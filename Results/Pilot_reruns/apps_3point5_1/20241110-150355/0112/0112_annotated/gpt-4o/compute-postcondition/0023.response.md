According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop has not found a suitable cube face, `found` will be False. To execute the loop one more time, the loop must not have found a suitable cube face for the current digit. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **The loop iterates through `n` times, checking if the `i-th` cube face has been used and if the `digit` is in that cube face. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop completes without finding a suitable cube face, `found` remains False, for the next iteration `found` needs to be False as well.**
