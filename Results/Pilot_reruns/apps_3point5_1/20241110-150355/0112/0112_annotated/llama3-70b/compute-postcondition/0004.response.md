Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated with the string representation of each `digit` in the `cube` set. As `cube` is non-empty, the loop iterates over each `digit` in `cube`. The `digits` set is updated with these string representations. The `cubes` set remains unchanged.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the `cube` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set**
