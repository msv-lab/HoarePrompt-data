According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If cubes is a non-empty set, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cubes` is a non-empty set. 
State: **`digits` is an empty set, `cubes` is a non-empty set**
