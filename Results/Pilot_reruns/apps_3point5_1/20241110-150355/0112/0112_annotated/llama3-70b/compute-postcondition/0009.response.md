According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the availability of cubes in the `cubes` set. If there is at least one cube available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set with one less cube available. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` set must still have at least one cube available, and `digits` should be updated to contain the string representations of digits from the next cube in the set.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set with at least one cube available**
