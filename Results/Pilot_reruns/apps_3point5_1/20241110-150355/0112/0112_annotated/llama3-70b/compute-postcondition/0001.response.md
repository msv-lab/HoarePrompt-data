Example Answer:
The code reads the input for `n` cubes, where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers. After execution, the list `cubes` will contain `n` lists of 6 integers each representing the faces of each cube.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3). Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the number on the j-th face of the i-th cube.**
