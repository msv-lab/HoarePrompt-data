According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cubes` being non-empty. If the set is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the `cube` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set. Since the set `cubes` is already non-empty, no adjustment is needed for it. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` set should be updated to include the string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set**
