Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated with string representations of each `digit` in the `cube` set. The `cube` set has one less cube available, so the `digits` set will contain string representations of digits from the next cube in the `cubes` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set with one less cube available.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set with one less cube available**
