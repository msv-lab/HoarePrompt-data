Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all the cubes in the `cubes` set, excluding '0'. If '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed. If `cubes` is an empty set, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. `max_num` is the integer value obtained by joining the sorted `digits` set in descending order.**
