Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube and adds its string representation to the set `digits`. The set `digits` is updated with the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube. The variables `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
