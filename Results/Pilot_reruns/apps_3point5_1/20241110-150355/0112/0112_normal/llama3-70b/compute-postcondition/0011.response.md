Example Answer:
The element '0' is removed from the set `digits`. The set `digits` contains unique string representations of all digits in the cubes combined. If '0' was present in any of the cubes, it is now removed from the set. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing unique string representations of all digits in the cubes combined without '0', `cube` is the last cube in the list.**
