According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cubes`. If the list has at least one more cube, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `cubes` must have at least one more cube, and the `cube` should move to the next cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the next cube, `cube` is the next cube in the list**
