Example Answer: 
A list of lists `cubes` is created by taking input `n` number of times where each input is split by space, converted to integers, and stored in a separate list. The variable `n` is an input integer, so after execution, the `cubes` list will contain `n` lists of integers based on the inputs provided.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers**
