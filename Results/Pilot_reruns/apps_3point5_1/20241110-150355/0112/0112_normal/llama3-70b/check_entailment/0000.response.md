Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program does not account for the fact that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may incorrectly consider 6 and 9 as interchangeable, leading to incorrect results. The code does not handle this specific case as described in the problem description.
