The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube. The function iterates with increasing values of `x` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the condition of the `can_form_number` function. If no such integer is found, it returns 0 as the value of `x`. The function then returns this calculated value of `x`.
