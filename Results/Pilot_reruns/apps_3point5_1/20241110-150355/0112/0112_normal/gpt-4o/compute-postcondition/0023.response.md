According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list and the value of `found`. If `found` is True, the loop does not execute again. If `found` is False, the loop will continue iterating through the digits. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute again. If the list `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
