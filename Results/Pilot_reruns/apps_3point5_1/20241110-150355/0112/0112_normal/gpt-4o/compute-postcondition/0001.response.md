Example Answer:
`used_cubes` is initialized as a list of `False` values with a length of `n`, where `n` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values**
