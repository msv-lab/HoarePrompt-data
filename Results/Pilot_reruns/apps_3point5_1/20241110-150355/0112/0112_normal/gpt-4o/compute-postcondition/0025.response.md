According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more digits in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the list should be available. Therefore, the `digit` should be the next digit in the list, and `found` should remain False.
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
