The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a list of digits representing a number. The function iterates through each digit in the list `digits` and checks if it can find a cube face that has not been used yet and contains the digit. If such a cube face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True and `found` is set to True. If `found` remains False after iterating through all cube faces, the loop returns False, indicating that a cube face for a digit was not found. If `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a list of digits `num` representing a number and determine if each digit can be formed by a unique cube face. The function returns True if each digit can be represented by a unique cube face, and False otherwise.
