According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be less than the new `n` value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
