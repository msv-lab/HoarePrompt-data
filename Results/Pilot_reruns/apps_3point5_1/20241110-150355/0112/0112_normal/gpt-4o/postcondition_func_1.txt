The function `can_form_number` takes a list of digits `num` representing a number and iterates through each digit to check if it can be formed by a unique cube face. If a corresponding cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True. If a cube face for a digit is not found or if the list `digits` is empty, the function returns False. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `n` is 0, and it should consider this edge case to provide a complete functionality summary.
