Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a given balance $x$. It handles the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes by checking if $x$ is in the prefix balances. The program also correctly calculates the prefix balances and counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
