Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the balance is not equal to x but still results in an infinite number of prefixes. For example, if n = 2, x = 0, and s = "01", the program should output -1 because the balance of the string is 0, but the number of prefixes will be infinite. However, the program will output 1 in this case.
