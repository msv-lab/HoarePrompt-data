Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. 

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the count of prefixes with the desired balance. The program is using a brute force approach to iterate through all prefix balances and check if the difference between the desired balance and the current prefix balance is a multiple of the balance of the string $s$. This approach does not cover all possible cases and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 0
101
```
The expected output should be 2, as there are two prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with balance 0: "1" and "101". However, the given program may not produce the correct result for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
