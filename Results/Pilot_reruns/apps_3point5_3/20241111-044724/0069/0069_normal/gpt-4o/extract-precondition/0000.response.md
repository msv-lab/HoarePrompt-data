**Precondition**: 
- The input consists of T test cases.
- For each test case, the input consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and -10^9 <= x <= 10^9.
- The input also contains a binary string s of length n such that each character si is either '0' or '1'.
- The total sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
