According to the code, the loop can execute if T is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to `T` is greater than or equal to 1, and the loop variable `_` should be set to 1.
State: **`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 1**
