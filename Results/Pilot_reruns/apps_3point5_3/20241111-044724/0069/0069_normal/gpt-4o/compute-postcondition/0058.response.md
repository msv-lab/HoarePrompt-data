Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` remain unchanged, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is not assigned a value yet, `s` is not assigned a value yet, `balance` is not calculated yet, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
