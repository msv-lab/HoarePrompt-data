Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` list has at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, `i` is incremented by 1, `count` is 2. If (x - b) % balance is equal to 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1.***
