Output State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string `s` up to a certain index and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. Therefore, the output state is that `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index.**
