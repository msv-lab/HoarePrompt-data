Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `prefix_balances` is updated according to the given formula, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is set to `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to the `results` list; otherwise, `0` is appended. In the scenario where `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of n+1. This postcondition captures all possible outcomes and edge cases of the if-else block.***
