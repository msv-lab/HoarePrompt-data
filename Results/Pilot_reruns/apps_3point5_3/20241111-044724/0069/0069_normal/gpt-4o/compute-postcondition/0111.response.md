The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and x, and a binary string s. The constraints for n and x are 1 <= n <= 10^5 and -10^9 <= x <= 10^9. The binary string s has a length of n, where each character si is either '0' or '1'. The total sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function does not have a specified return value.
