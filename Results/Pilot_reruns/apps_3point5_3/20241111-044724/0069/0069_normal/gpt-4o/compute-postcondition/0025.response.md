Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in the list.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in the list**
