Postcondition: ***`count` may be increased by 1. `prefix_balances` remains unchanged with a list of zeros of length 2 or more. `results` remain unchanged. `T` is greater than the current iteration count. `x` remains unassigned. `s` remains unassigned. `balance` is not calculated yet. `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
