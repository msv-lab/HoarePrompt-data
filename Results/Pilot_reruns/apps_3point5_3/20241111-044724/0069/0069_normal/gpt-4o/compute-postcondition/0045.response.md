Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, and `balance` is calculated as described**
