According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in `results`. To execute the loop one more time, `results` must have at least 4 elements, and `result` should be the fourth element in `results`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in `results`**
