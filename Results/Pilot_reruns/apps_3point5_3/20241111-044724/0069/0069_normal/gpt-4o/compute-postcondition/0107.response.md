According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 3 elements, and `result` should be the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
