According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. This ensures that the loop will execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_balances` is updated according to the provided formula, `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, and `balance` is calculated as described**
