Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer that may be increased by 1. `prefix_balances` remains unchanged with a list of zeros of length 2 or more. `results` remain unchanged. `T` is greater than the current iteration count. `x` remains unassigned. `s` remains unassigned. `balance` is not calculated yet. `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1.***
