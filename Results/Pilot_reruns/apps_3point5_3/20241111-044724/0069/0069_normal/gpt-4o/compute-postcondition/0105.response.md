According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 elements, and `result` should be the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
