According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in `results`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
