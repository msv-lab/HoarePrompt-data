Output State: **`prefix_balances` list has at least n elements, `b` is the nth element in `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, `i` is incremented by 1, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, results list has the updated count value.**
