Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string `s` up to a certain index and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, then after the if-else block executes, `prefix_balances` remains a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index. If `x` is already in `prefix_balances`, then `results` appends -1. Otherwise, `results` appends 0. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the states of `prefix_balances` and `results` remain unchanged.***
