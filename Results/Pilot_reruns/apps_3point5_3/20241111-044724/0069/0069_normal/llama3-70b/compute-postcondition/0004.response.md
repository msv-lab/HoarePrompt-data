Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s` respectively. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown, as they depend on the input string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
