Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `n` and `x` are dependent on user input, so no specific values can be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers**
