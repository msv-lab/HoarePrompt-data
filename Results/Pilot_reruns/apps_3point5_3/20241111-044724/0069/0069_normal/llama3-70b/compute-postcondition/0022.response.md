Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The previous values of `n` and `x` are positive integers. Therefore, the output state is: `T-1`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1, and `s` is assigned the input string, `n` and `x` are positive integers from the input.
Output State: **`T-1`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1, and `s` is assigned the input string, `n` and `x` are positive integers from the input**
