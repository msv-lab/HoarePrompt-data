Postcondition: ***`T-1`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1, and `s` is assigned the input string. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) based on the values of the input variables and their relationships.***
