The function `func_1` reads input data for multiple test cases, processes each case to calculate the sum of integers based on a binary string's representation, where '0' corresponds to adding `x` and '1' corresponds to subtracting `x`. The function then determines the final sum of integers and prints the results. However, the code has a potential issue with the `if x in prefix_balances` condition, as it checks for exact equality instead of considering the sum. Additionally, there could be edge cases where the division by `balance` results in a floating-point number, which is not explicitly handled in the code.
