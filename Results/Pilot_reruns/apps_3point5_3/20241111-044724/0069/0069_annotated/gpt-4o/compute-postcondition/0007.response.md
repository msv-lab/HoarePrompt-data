Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 1. Since `index` is 1, `data[index + 1]` refers to the value at index 2 of the list `data`. Therefore, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 2 of the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the list `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the list `data`**
