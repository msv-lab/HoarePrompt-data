Example Answer:
The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list, `index` is an updated index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an updated index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`**
