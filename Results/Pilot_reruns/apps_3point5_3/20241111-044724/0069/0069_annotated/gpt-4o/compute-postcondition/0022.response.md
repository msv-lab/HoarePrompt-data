Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain -1. Otherwise, `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros, and `results` will have an additional element with the value 0.***
