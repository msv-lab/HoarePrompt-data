The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the sum of integers based on the input constraints. The function takes the inputs n, x, and s as described in the constraints. It then calculates the sum of integers based on the binary representation of s, where each '0' in the binary string corresponds to x and each '1' corresponds to -x. The function returns the final sum of integers. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of integers based on the binary representation of a given string s, where each '0' corresponds to x and each '1' corresponds to -x. The function returns the final sum of integers.**
