According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is already equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time.
No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 
State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an updated index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction of counts of '1's and '0's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of n + 1 zeros, `i` is n + 1**
