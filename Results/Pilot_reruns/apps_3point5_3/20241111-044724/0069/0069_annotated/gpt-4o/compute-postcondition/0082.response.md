According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to n + 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to n + 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an updated index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction of counts of '1's and '0's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of n + 1 zeros, `i` is n + 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`
