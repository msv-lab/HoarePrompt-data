Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is unknown. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `count` is an incremented integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list.
Output State: **`count` is an incremented integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list**
