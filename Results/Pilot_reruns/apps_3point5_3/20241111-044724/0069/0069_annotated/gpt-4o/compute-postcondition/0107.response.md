According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list, `results` has at least one more element, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition, `prefix_balances` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list should have at least one more element than the current state.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list, `results` is a list with at least two more elements, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition, `prefix_balances` is not empty**
