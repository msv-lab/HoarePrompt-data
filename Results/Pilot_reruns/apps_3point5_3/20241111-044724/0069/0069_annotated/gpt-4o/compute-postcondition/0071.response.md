Example Answer:
The value of `index` is used to access the element at `index + 1` in the list `data`. If `index` is a valid index and the element at `index + 1` can be converted to an integer, `x` will be assigned that integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`.
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`**
