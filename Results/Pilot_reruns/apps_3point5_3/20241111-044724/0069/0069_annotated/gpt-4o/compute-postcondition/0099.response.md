Example Answer:
If the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied, then `count` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, there will be no change in the state of the variables. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. Therefore, after executing the code `results.append(count)`, the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list.
Output State: **`count` is increased by 1 or remains 0 based on the conditions, and the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list**
