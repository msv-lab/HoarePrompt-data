According to the code, the loop executes `T` times. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `n` is greater than 0, adjust `prefix_balances` to contain the cumulative sum of balances calculated for each element in the `s` list.
- If `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the division result is non-negative, increment `count` by 1.
- Increase `index` by 3 after the loop.

State: **Adjust the states based on the conditions mentioned above to maintain the consistency and readiness for the next iteration.**
