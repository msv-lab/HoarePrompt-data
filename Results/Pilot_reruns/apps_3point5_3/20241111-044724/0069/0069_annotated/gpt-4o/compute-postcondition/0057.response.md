Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` is 0, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of balance calculated for each element in the `s` list, `count` is 1**
