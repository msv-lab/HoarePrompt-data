Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least 3 elements, `count` is an incremented integer.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least 3 elements, `count` is an incremented integer**
