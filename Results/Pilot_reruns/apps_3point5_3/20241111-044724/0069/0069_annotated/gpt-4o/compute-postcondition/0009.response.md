Example Answer:
The value of `index` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `index` is 1. After execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the list `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the list `data`, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the list `data`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the list `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the list `data`, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the list `data`**
