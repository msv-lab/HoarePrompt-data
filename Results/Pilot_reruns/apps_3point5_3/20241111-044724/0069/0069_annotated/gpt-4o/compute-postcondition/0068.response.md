Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes and updates `prefix_balances` based on the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. The `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` is appended. `index` is increased by 3 after the loop. If `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of balances calculated for each element in the `s` list. During the loop, if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the division result is non-negative, `count` is incremented by 1. The final state includes all the described scenarios and maintains the consistency of the initial conditions specified in the precondition.***
