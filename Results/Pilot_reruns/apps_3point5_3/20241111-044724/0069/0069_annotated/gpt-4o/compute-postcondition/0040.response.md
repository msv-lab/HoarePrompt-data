Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the element at index `index + 2` in the list `data`. The variables `prefix_balances` storing the cumulative sum of balance for each element in the list `s` and `balance` remain unchanged. The variable `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`. The variable `n` remains an integer greater than 0. 
Output State: **`prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list, `balance` is 0, `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 0**
