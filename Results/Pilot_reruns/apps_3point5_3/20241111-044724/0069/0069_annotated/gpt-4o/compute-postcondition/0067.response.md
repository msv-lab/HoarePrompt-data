Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: If n is greater than 0, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of balances calculated for each element in the s list. If (x - b) is divisible by balance and the division result is non-negative, count will be incremented by 1 after each iteration. If n is 0 or negative, prefix_balances will remain a list of zeros with a length of (n + 1), and the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list.
