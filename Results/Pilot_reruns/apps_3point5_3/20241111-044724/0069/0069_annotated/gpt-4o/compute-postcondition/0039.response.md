Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is not given, so the exact value of `x` cannot be determined. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list, `balance` is 0, `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 0.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list, `balance` is 0, `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 0**
