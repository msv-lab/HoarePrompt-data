Example Answer: 
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from input.
Output State: **`T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from input**
