Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x`, `s` are input integers. `cnt0` contains the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` contains the count of '1' characters in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including the edge cases where the denominator is 0 or the result of the division is an integer.***
