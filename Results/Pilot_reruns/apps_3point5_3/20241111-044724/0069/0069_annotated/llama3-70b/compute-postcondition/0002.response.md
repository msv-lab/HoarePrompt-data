Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input provided. If the input is "3 5", then `n` will be 3 and `x` will be 5. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **`T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
