Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, n and x are input integers, s is a string from input, cnt0 contains the count of '0' characters in s, cnt1 contains the count of '1' characters in s, balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program calculates ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) and prints the result. The program handles all edge cases including the scenario where the denominator (cnt0 - cnt1) becomes zero, ensuring the program does not encounter division by zero error and provides meaningful output.***
