The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, then iterates `T` times. In each iteration, it reads integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`, and determines a balance. Based on the balance compared to `x`, it prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is zero, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The program accounts for potential division by zero cases. The function does not explicitly return any value.
