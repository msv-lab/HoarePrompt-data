According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` have elements. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_queue` may have elements remaining, and `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, the value of `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` and `r_index` have been updated based on the condition.**
