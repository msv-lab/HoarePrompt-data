Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are initially non-empty, the loop will continue until one of them becomes empty. After each iteration, d_index and r_index are updated based on the popped values from d_queue and r_queue respectively. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is appended with d_index + n, otherwise r_queue is appended with r_index + n. The loop will stop when either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty.**
