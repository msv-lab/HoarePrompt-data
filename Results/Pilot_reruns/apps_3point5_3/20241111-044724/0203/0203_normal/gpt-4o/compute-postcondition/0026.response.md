Example Answer:
The value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. The previous state of `d_queue` may have had elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified, and `votes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified, `votes` remain unchanged, and the value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified, `votes` remain unchanged, and the value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`**
