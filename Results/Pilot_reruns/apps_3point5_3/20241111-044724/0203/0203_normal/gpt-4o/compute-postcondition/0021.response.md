Example Answer: 
The value of `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. The previous state of `r_queue` depends on its initial elements and the value of `r_index + n`. The state of `d_queue` remains the same, and `votes` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` is modified with the appended value of `r_index + n`, `votes` is unchanged.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` is modified with the appended value of `r_index + n`, `votes` is unchanged**
