Example Answer: 
If the second element in the `votes` list is 'D', then 0 is appended to `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains empty. If the second element in the `votes` list is not 'D', then 0 is appended to `r_queue`, and `d_queue` remains empty. In either case, `votes` list has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `v` is the second element in the `votes` list. After executing the code `r_queue.append(i)`, the value of `i` which is 1 is appended to `r_queue`, so `r_queue` will now contain [1].
Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` contains [1], `votes` list has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `v` is the second element in the `votes` list**
