Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` list and assigns it to `d_index`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error will occur. The states of `r_queue` and `votes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` is unchanged, and `votes` is unchanged.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` is unchanged, and `votes` is unchanged**
