Example Answer: 
The code pops the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. If `r_queue` had elements, `r_index` would be assigned the first element, and `r_queue` would have one less element. However, if `r_queue` was empty, an error would occur. The state of `d_queue` and `votes` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` is modified, `votes` is unchanged**
