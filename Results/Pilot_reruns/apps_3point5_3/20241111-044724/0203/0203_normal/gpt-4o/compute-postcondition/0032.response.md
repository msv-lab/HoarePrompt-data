Example Answer:
The value of `d_index` is added with `n` and then appended to `d_queue`. The previous state of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `n` are not provided, so the output state is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`**
