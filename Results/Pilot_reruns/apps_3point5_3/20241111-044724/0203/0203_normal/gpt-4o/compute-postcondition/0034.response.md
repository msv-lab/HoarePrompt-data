Postcondition: ***`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.***
