Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the second element in the `votes` list is 'D', then 1 is appended to `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains empty. If the second element in the `votes` list is not 'D', then 1 is appended to `r_queue`, and `d_queue` remains empty. In either case, `votes` list has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `v` is the second element in the `votes` list.***
