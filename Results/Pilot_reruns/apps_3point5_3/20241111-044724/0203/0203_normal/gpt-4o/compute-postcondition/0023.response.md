According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` have elements. For the loop to execute one more time, the postcondition provided indicates the scenarios based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. 

If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is updated with `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged and `votes` is still the same. Therefore, for the next iteration, `d_index` should be less than `r_index`.

If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is modified with the appended value of `r_index + n`, `d_queue` may have elements remaining, and `votes` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the next iteration, `r_index` should be greater than `d_index`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining with the new appended value based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is updated with `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged and `votes` is still the same. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is modified with the appended value of `r_index + n`, `d_queue` may have elements remaining, and `votes` remains unchanged.**
