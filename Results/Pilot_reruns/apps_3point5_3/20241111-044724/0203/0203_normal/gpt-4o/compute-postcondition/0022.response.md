Postcondition: ***`d_queue` may have elements remaining with the new appended value based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is updated with `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged and `votes` is still the same. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is modified with the appended value of `r_index + n`, `d_queue` may have elements remaining, and `votes` remains unchanged. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the state of the program variables is clearly defined.***
