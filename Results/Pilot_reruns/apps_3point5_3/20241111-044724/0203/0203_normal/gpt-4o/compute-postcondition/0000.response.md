Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000. votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fraction of each employee.**
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000. votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fraction of each employee.**
