Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly simulates the voting process where employees from different fractions take turns denying each other the right to vote until only one remains. The code handles the scenario where an employee skips their turn if they no longer have the right to vote. Additionally, the code correctly determines the winning party based on the index of the remaining employee in the string of votes. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
