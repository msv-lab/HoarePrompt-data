According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 element (fraction), the loop executes. At the start, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee, depublicans is 0, and remocrats is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the fractions list must have at least 1 element, and the fraction being iterated on is the first fraction in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0, fraction is the first fraction in the list**
