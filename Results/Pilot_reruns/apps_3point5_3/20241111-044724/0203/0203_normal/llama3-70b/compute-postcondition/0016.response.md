According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If there are more fractions left in the string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `fractions` is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element with the next fraction in line. If the fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1. If the fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more fraction left in the `fractions` string. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is the fraction pointer in the `fractions` string.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element with the next fraction in line (pointer moved to the next fraction)**
