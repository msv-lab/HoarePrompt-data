Example Answer:
The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is increased by 1. Since the code snippet does not mention any change in `depublicans`, it remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element, remocrats is incremented by 1, and depublicans remains 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element, remocrats is incremented by 1, and depublicans remains 0**
