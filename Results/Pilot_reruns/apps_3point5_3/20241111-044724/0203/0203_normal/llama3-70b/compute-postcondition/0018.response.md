Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element. If the fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by the total count of 'D' fractions encountered so far, and remocrats remains 0. If the fraction is not 'D', remocrats is incremented by the total count of non-'D' fractions encountered so far, and depublicans remains 0. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute and depublicans and remocrats remain 0.**
