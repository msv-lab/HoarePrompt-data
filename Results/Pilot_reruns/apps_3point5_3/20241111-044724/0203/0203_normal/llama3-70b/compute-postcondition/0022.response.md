Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and an input string representing the fraction of depublicans and remocrats among employees. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the input string and prints 'D' if the count of depublicans is greater than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. If the input string is empty, it prints 'R'.**
