Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the number of employees and their fractions correctly. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the input string and prints 'D' if the count of depublicans is greater than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it accurately predicts the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of the employees. The code also handles the case where the input string is empty by printing 'R', as specified in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code and they do not provide any examples that contradict the code's functionality.
