Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains an empty list. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains an empty list. If the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string in the order they appear, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in the `votes` string in the order they appear. After executing the code `d_index` is assigned the value that is popped from the front of the `d_queue` list, and `r_index` is assigned the value that is popped from the front of the `r_queue` list. `d_queue` is appended with the value `d_index + n`**
