Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If the next character in `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` is appended with the index of the last character processed in the previous iteration + 1. If the next character in `votes` is 'R', `r_queue` is appended with the index of the last character processed in the previous iteration + 1. In all cases, the rest of the variables maintain their initial states as described in the precondition.***
