Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, a new element is added to `d_queue` with the value `d_index + n`, and `d_index` is updated to `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, a new element is added to `r_queue` with the value `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is updated to the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. In all cases, `r_queue` contains the value `r_index + n` after the if-else block executes.***
