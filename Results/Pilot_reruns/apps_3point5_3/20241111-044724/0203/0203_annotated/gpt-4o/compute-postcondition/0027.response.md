Example Answer: 
The value of `r_index` is added to `n` and appended to `r_queue`. Since the values of `r_index`, `n`, and `r_queue` are unknown, the output state after this operation is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`**
