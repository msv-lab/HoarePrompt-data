According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to have at least one element in them. Additionally, if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then a new value needs to be appended to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then a new value needs to be appended to `r_queue`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` both have at least one element, `d_index` and `r_index` are updated based on popped elements and new values are appended accordingly**
