Example Answer:
The value of `d_index` is added to `n` and then appended to the `d_queue`. Since the initial state of `d_index` is popped from `d_queue`, the value of `d_index` itself is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is not empty and has the new appended value, `r_queue` is not affected, `d_index` and `r_index` are popped elements.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is not empty and has the new appended value, `r_queue` is not affected, `d_index` and `r_index` are popped elements**
