Example Answer: 
The code pops the first element from the `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` is not empty, the value popped is valid. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`**
