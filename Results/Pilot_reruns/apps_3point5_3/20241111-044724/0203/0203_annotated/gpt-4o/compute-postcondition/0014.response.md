Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `r_queue`. The value of `i` is not provided, so the exact values in the `r_queue` are unknown. The length of `r_queue` will increase by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1, length of `r_queue` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1, length of `r_queue` is increased by 1**
