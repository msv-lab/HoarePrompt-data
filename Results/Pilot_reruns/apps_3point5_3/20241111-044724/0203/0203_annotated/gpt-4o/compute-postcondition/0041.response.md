Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then simulates an election process where 'D' represents Democrats and 'R' represents Republicans. The function rearranges votes between 'D' and 'R' based on indices and prints the winner of the election. If there is a tie in the number of votes, the function prints "Tie". However, there seems to be missing functionality in the code implementation related to the rearrangement of votes based on comparisons between indices, so the actual winner determination might not be accurate.**
