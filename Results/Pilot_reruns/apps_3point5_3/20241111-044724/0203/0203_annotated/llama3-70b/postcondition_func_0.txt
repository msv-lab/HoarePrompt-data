The function accepts user input for the number of employees and a string representing the fractions of employees as 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. It then calculates the counts of depublicans and remocrats and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, 'R' if there are more remocrats than depublicans, and 'R' if they are equal. If the input string is empty, it prints 'R'.
