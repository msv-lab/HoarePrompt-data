Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
