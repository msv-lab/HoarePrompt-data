Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is either 1 or 0, so after execution, `depublicans` will be either 2 or 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, `depublicans` is either 2 or 1, `remocrats` is either 1 if the next fraction is not 'D' or 0 if it is.
