Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, `remocrats` is increased by 1**
