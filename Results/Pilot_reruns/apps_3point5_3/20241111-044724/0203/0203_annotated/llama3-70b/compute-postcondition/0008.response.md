According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more fractions to iterate through in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list, `depublicans` is either 1 if the first fraction is 'D' or 0 if it's not, `remocrats` is either 1 if the first fraction is not 'D' or 0 if it is. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next fraction in the list needs to be accessed.
State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, `depublicans` is either 1 if the next fraction is 'D' or 0 if it's not, `remocrats` is either 1 if the next fraction is not 'D' or 0 if it is**
