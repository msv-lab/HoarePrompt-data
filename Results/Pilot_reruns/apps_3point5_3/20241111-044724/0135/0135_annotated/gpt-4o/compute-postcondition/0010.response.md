Example Answer: 
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state. Since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine the value of `remainder`. The state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
