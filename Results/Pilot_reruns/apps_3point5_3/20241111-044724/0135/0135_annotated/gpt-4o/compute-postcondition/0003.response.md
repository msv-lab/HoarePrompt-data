According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range has elements (i.e., k is at least 1). Before the loop starts, seen_remainders is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, you need to update the state to `seen_remainders` is an empty set and `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
