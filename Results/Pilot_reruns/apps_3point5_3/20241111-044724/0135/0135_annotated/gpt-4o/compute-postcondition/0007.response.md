According to the code, the loop will iterate from 1 to `k` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
