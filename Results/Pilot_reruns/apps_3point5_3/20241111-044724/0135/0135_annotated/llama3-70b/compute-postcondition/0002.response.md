According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. The loop iterates over the range 1 to k+1, so for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `seen` is an empty set. So, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and `seen` is an empty set.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set**
