Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set**
