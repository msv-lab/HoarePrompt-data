Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is the input integer and `i` is adjusted to `k + 1`. The value of `k` is given to be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1**
