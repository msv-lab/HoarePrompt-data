According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and `seen` is a set containing the added `remainder` value. 

To execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1`**
