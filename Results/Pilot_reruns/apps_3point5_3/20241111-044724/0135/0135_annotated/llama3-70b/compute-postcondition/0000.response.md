Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. Since the input is specified to be integers, `n` and `k` will hold integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
