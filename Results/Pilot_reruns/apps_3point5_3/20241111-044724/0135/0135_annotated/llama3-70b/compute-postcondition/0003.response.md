Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `remainder`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set**
