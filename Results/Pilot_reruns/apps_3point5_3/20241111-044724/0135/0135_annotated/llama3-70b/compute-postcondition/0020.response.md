According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1. If the `remainder` is present in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k + 2`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is `k + 2`**
