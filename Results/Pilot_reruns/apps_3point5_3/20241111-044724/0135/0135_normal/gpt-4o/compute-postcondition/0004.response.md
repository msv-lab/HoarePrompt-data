Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is an integer and `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the remainder of `n` divided by 1 is always 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer, k is an integer, n > k, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, i is 1, remainder is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, n > k, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, i is 1, remainder is 0**
