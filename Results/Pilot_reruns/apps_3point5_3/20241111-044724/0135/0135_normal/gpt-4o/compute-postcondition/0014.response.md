The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 

Case 2: If k is less than n, the function continues without any changes to the variables n and k. After the loop executes, n and k are integers such that n > k, k is between 1 and 10^18, i is between 1 and k, and remainder is the result of n % i. If the remainder is in the list of seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'.

Case 3: The function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers n and k, ensure that n > k, and return 'Yes' if certain conditions are met, 'No' otherwise.
