Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n and k are integers such that n > k, k is between 1 and 10^18, i is between 1 and k, and remainder is the result of n % i. If the remainder is in the list of seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'.**
