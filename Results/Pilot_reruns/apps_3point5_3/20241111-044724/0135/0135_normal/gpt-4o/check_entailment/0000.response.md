Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to match the problem description. It takes two integers `n` and `k`, ensuring that `n > k`, and then checks for unique remainders of `n` divided by `i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'. The function correctly determines if there are any duplicate remainders when `n` is divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, as required by the problem description. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that the code indeed follows the specified logic.
