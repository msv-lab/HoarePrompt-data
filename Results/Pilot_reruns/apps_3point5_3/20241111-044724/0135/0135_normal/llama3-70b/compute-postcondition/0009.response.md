Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set. Since `i` is 2, the `remainder` will be the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. The output state will be that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
