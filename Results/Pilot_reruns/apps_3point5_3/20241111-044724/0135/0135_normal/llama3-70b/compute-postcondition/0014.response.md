According to the code, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the value of `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and reach a value less than or equal to `k` in the next iteration. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set**
