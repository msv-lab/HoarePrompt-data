Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks whether all the remainders of division of a number n by all integers from 1 to k are distinct. It covers all potential cases where the remainders might not be distinct and returns "No" in those cases. The program also handles the case when k is greater than or equal to n. 

For example:
- Input: 4 4
  Output: No
  Explanation: The remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Input: 5 3
  Output: Yes
  Explanation: All the remainders are distinct.
