Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct as required. It iterates through each integer from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if that remainder has been seen before. If it has, it prints "No" and exits. If no duplicate remainders are found, it prints "Yes". The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the remainders are distinct.
