The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of the elements in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the sum of the elements in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the sum of the elements in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.**
