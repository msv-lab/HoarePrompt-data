According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 3, i is 2. If a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i-1], then m is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, and the condition a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i-1] must be true. 
So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 3, i is 3**
