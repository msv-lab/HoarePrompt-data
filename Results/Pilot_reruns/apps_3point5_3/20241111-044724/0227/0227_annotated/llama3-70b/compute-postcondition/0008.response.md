Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `m` is 2. After execution, `m` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 3, i is 2.
Output State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 3, i is 2**
