Output State: **If `assigned` contains an element that can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element in `assigned` after the loop executes. If `assigned` is empty or no element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]`, `can_form` remains False and `x` will be the last element in `assigned`.**
