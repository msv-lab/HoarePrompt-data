The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9). After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and contains elements from list `a`, `m` is the number of times an element in `a` cannot be formed by subtracting any element in `assigned`, `i` is the index of the last element processed in list `a`, `can_form` is True if an element in `a` can be formed by subtracting any element in `assigned`, `x` is the last element in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. The function returns `m`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers. It processes the elements in `a`, checks if they can be formed by subtracting any element in `assigned`, and returns the number of times an element in `a` cannot be formed by subtraction.**
