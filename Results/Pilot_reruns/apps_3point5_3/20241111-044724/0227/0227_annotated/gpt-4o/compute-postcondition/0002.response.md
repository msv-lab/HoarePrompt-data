Example Answer:
`assigned` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, which is the first element of list `a`. Since the list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`**
