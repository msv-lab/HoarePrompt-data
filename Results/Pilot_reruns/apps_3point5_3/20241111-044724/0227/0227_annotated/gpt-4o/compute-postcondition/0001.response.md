Example Answer:
`assigned` is initialized as an empty set. There are no changes to the values of `n` and `a`, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set**
