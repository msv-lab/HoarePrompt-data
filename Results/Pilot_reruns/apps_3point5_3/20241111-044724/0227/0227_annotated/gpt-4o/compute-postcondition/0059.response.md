Postcondition: ***If the new element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, and the loop is terminated. The values of `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met for any element in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty or does not contain an element that can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. In all cases, `m` is increased by 1 after the if statement executes.***
