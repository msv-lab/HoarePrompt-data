Output State: **If `assigned` contains an element that can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and has a new element added, `m` is 3, `i` is 2, and `x` is the last element in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty or no element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]`, then `can_form` remains False, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and has a new element added, `m` is 3, `i` is 2, and `x` is the last element in `assigned`.**
