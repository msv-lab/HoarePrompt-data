According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. The loop will iterate over each element in `assigned`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `assigned` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element in `assigned`**
