Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem. The program first reads the input, sorts the sequence of numbers, and then iterates through the sequence to check if the current number is exactly double the previous number. If it is not, then it increases the count of variables required. Finally, it outputs the minimum number of variables needed. 

The program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
