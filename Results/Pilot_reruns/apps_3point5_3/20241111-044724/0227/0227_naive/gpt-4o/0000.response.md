Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values, sorts them, and iterates through each value to check if it can be formed using the previously assigned values. If it cannot be formed, a new variable is added. This logic ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations is calculated accurately. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines the minimum number of variables required.
