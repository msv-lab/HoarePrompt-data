Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 4. The states of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 4, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 4, `i` is 2**
