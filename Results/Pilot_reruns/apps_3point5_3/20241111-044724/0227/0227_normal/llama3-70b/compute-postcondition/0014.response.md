Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is the number of elements in list `a` that are not twice the previous element. `i` is the index of the current element being checked. If no elements in `a` violate the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` remains 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute.**
