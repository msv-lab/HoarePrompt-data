Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is not specified, the values of the list `a` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers from the input**
