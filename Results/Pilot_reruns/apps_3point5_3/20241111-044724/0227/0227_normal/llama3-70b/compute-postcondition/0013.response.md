According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 3 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 4, `i` is 3**
