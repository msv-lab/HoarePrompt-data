The function func_1 accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the elements in list `a`, adding them to the `assigned` set based on certain conditions. If during the iterations of the loop, there is no element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1. The function returns the final value of `m` after the loop execution.
