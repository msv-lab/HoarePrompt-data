Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The set `assigned` and the element `a[i+1]` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: The element `a[i+1]` is added to the `assigned` set, `can_form` is False.
Output State: **The element `a[i+1]` is added to the `assigned` set, `can_form` is False**
