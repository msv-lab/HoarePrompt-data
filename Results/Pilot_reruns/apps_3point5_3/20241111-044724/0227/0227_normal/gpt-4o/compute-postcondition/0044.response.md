According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If the assigned list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `can_form` is False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list.
State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is not incremented, `assigned` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned` list**
