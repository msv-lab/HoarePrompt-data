Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable that remains True if `a[i] - x` is found in the `assigned` list during any iteration of the loop. `m` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned` throughout the loop's execution, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `can_form` as False and `m` remains unchanged.**
