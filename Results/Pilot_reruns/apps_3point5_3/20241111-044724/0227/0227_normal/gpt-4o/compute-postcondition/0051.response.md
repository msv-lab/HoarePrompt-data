Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, `m` is not incremented, `assigned` has at least 1 more element after `x` is removed, and the new `x` is the first element in the adjusted `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, no changes occur.***
