Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence and then iterates through it to check if each element is equal to the previous element multiplied by 2. If not, it increments the count of variables needed. The program then prints the final count if it's less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic used in the program is sound and covers all possible cases, making it correct.
