Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided problem description. It considers the time for Edward to exit his apartment, the time to walk around the circular building either clockwise or counterclockwise, and then the time to reach Natasha's apartment. The logic for calculating the time based on the block, floor, and specific apartment numbers is implemented correctly. Additionally, the program handles the edge cases of Edward being on the first floor of his block and calculates the time accordingly. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
