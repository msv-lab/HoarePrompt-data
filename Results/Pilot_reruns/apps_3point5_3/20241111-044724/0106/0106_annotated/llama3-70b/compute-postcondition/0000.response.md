Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. Since the initial state does not specify the exact input values, the output state will depend on the user input within the specified constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified constraints provided by the user input**
