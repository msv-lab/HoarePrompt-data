The function `func` reads input for positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates various values based on the input and conditions provided. The function computes `min_block_time` based on certain conditions and calculates `min_floor_time` based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Finally, it prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The function does not return any specific value.
