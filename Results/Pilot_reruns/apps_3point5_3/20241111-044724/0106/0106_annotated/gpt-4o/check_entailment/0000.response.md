Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` work together to determine the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given conditions. The code handles the calculation of time for moving between apartments, blocks, and floors as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the code considers the special case when Edward is already on the first floor of his block.

Furthermore, the annotations in the code provide insights into the state of the program at different stages, helping to understand the flow of calculations and decisions made by the code. The provided examples in the problem description align with the expected output calculated by the code, confirming its correctness.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, the problem description, and the provided examples, the code can be deemed correct for all potential cases.
