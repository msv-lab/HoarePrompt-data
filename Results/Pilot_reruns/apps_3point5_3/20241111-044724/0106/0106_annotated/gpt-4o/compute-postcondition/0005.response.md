Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the block and floor numbers based on the provided formulas. The function assumes constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as specified. It returns the calculated values for `block` and `floor`. The function does not handle cases where the constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not met, which could lead to unexpected results.**
