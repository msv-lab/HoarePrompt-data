Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` and `m` are input integers. The value of `a_floor` will be between 1 and `m` based on the formula. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`**
