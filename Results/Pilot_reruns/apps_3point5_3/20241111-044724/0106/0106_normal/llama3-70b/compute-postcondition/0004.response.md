Example Answer:
`b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `b` is given as an input integer, and `m` is a positive integer. Therefore, `b_floor` will be in the range from 1 to `m`. Other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is a positive integer, `b_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`.**
