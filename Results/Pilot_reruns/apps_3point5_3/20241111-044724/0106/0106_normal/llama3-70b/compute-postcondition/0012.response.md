Functionality: **The function reads three positive integers n, m, and k, followed by two input integers a and b. It then calculates various values based on the input and prints the sum of min_block_time and min_floor_time. The min_block_time and min_floor_time are calculated based on the formulas provided in the code. The function does not return anything but performs calculations and prints the final result.**
