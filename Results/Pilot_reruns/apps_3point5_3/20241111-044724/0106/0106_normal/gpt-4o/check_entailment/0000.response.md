Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering various factors such as block and floor distances, time to exit the current block, time to walk directly to the target block, time to walk in reverse to the target block, and time to reach the target floor. The `func_1` function takes into account different scenarios based on the initial and target apartment locations, and calculates the total time accurately. The `get_location` function correctly determines the block and floor numbers for a given apartment. All the provided examples are valid and the program outputs the correct minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in each case.
