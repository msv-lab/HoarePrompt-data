Example Answer: 
`floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` using the formula `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` determine the result of the calculation, which will be the value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k.
Output State: **The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
