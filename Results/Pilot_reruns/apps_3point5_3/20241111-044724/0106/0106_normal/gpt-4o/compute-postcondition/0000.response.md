Example Answer:
The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is used to calculate `block`. Since the initial state does not provide values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, the output state will be in terms of these variables.
Output State: **The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**.
