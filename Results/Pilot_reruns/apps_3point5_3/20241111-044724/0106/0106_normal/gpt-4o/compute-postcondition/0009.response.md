Example Answer: 
If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
After executing the code, `total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
Output State: **The variables `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged. `time_to_exit` and `time_to_target_floor` are updated based on the given conditions. `direct_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `total_time` are calculated accordingly.**
