The function `get_location` accepts parameters `apartment`, `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `block`. `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `block` are integers used to calculate the `floor` where the apartment is located. The `floor` is calculated based on the values of `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `block`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to calculate and return the `floor` where the apartment is located based on the provided parameters.
