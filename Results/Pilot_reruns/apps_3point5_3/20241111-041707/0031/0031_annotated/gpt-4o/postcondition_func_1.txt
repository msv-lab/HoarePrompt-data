The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 left shifted by n, the function prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates values for total_days, numerator, and denominator based on the loop with range k. It then computes p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g using these values. Finally, it updates A and B, prints the values of A and B modulo MOD, and there is no change in the state of the program variables if the initial condition is not met.
