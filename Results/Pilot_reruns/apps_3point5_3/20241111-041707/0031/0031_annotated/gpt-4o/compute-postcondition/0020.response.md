Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, where `p_total` retains its previous value, `p_no_shared` is not mentioned, `MOD` retains its previous value. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` retain their previous values; `i` is 0, `k` is the original value, `total_days` remains unchanged, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as described.
