Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` will be updated based on the previous calculations. If k is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` will remain the same as `numerator`. All other variables remain unchanged as follows: `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` will retain their previous values; `i` will be 0, `k` will be the original value, `total_days` will remain unchanged.**
