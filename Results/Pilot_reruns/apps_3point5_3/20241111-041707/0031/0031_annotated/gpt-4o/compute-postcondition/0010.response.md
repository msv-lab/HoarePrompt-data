According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `numerator` has been updated according to the formula, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
