Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i)` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The initial values are `MOD` is 1000003, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. After execution, the new value of `numerator` is calculated based on the initial values and the formula provided. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `numerator` has been updated according to the formula, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
