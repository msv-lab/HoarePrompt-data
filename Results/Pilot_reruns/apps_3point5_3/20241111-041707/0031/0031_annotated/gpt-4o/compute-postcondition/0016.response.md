According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 0. This means the loop can execute one more time. 
The only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `numerator` is updated according to the formula, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` and then taken modulo `MOD`**
