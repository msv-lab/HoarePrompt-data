According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `numerator` has been updated according to the formula, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` and then taken modulo `MOD`**
