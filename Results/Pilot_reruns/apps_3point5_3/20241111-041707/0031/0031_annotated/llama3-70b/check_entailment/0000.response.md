Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incorrect according to the problem description. The main issue lies in the calculation of the probability. The code calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday, but it does not handle the case where all k people have different birthdays.

For example, if n = 3 and k = 3, the output should be 0 1 (since it is guaranteed that all three people have different birthdays). However, the code does not account for this case and always calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness false. The annotations did not influence this conclusion as they do not cover this specific scenario.
