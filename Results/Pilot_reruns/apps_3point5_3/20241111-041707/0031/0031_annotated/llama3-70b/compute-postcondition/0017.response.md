Example Answer: 
The function returns the remainder of numerator divided by (10 ** 6 + 3) and the remainder of denominator divided by (10 ** 6 + 3). The values of numerator and denominator have been updated by executing `numerator //= gcd`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator //= gcd` has been executed, `denominator` is updated accordingly, and the function returns the remainders.
Output State: **`numerator //= gcd` has been executed, `denominator` is updated accordingly, and the function returns the remainders**
