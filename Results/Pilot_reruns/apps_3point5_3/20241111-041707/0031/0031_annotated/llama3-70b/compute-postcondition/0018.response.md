The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the `numerator` is divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) and updated accordingly. The function then returns the remainder after the division. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, update the `numerator` by dividing it by the gcd, and return the remainder.
