According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of k is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the value of n is between 1 and 10^18 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `total_days` is calculated based on the value of n, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
