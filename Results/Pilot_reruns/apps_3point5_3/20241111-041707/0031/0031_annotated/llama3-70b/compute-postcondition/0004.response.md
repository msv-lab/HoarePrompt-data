Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `i` is unknown. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `i`, we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is updated.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is updated**
