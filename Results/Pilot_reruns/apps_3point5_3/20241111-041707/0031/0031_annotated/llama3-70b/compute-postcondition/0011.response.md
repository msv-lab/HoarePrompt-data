Example Answer:
`denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, and `total_days` depends on the value of `n`. The value of `i` is less than `k+1` and `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer at least 2, `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, `denominator` is updated, `i` is less than `k+1, and `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`**
