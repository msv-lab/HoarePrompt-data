Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and calculates the probability as required. The gcd function is used to find the greatest common divisor between A and B to ensure they are coprime before taking the remainder modulo 10^6 + 3. The program handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
