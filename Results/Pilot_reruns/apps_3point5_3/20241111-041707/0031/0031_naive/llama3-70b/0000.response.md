Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland given the values of n and k. It calculates the numerator and denominator using a loop that iterates over the range of k, and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd). The final result is then printed modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic of the program is consistent with the problem description for all potential cases and the examples provided.
