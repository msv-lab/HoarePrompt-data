Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The previous values of `total_days`, `i`, `MOD` are not mentioned, so we assume they are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
