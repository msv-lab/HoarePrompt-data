Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` and then modulo `MOD`. Since `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `total_days` will be 2^n. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` will be `(denominator * 2^n) % MOD`. All other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
