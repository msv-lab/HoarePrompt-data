The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints are that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If k is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If k is at least 2, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated using the input values of `n` and `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The function returns `numerator % (10`. 

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k` with specified constraints. If k is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If k is at least 2, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The function returns `numerator % (10`.**
