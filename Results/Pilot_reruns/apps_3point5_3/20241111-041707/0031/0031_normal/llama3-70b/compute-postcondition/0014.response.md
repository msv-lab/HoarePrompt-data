Example Answer:
If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and therefore `numerator` and `denominator` are not calculated. The value of `gcd` is calculated as the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator` using the `math.gcd` function. If `k` is at least 2, then `numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, and `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. The `gcd` value is calculated based on these values.
Output State: **If k is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If k is at least 2, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
