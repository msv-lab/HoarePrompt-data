Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since the value of `total_days` depends on `n`, and the value of `n` is known to be a valid integer, the new value of `denominator` will be `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` starts from 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` starts from 0**
