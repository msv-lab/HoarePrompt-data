Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k` with specific constraints. If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If `k` is at least 2, the function calculates `numerator` and `denominator`, finds their greatest common divisor (`gcd`), divides `numerator` and `denominator` by `gcd`, and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by 10^6 + 3. **
