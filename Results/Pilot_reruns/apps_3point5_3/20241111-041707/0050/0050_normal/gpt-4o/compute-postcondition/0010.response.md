Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` with `remaining_bourles`. The function then prints `total_bourles`, covering all possible edge cases.***
