Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r` as input, followed by two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum value in list `s` as `min_buy_price` and the maximum value in list `b` as `max_sell_price`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought (`max_shares`), the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price` (`remaining_bourles`), and the total amount of money needed (`total_bourles`). It then prints `total_bourles`. The function handles all possible edge cases and missing functionality, ensuring a comprehensive financial calculation process.**
