Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by taking the modulus of `r` with `s[i]`. The previous values of `r` and `s[i]` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` is updated based on the calculation, `s`, `b` remain unchanged, `shares` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` is updated based on the calculation, `s`, `b` remain unchanged, `shares` is updated based on the calculation**
