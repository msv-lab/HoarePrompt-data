According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The other variables `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` do not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged**
