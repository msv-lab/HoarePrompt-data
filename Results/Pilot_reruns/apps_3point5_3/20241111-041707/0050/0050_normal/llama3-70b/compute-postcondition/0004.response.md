Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The previous state of `b` was a sorted list of integers. After sorting in reverse order, `b` is now sorted in descending order. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**.
