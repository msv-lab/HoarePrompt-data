Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of mapping each element from the input split by space to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
