According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `shares` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`shares` is 0, `s` and `b` remain unchanged, `r` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is less than `m`**
