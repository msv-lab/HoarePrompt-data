Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop. In either case, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
