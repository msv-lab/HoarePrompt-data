According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers**
