Correctness: **True**

The code aligns with the problem description. It correctly reads the input values and sorts the buy prices in ascending order and sell prices in descending order. It then iterates over the buy prices to calculate the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount of bourles. After that, it distributes these shares among the sell prices to maximize the remaining bourles. Finally, it prints the remaining bourles after the transactions. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
