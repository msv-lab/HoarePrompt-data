Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the minimum buy price, maximum sell price, and then determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought and the remaining bourles after buying those shares. It then calculates the total bourles after selling the shares at the maximum sell price. The logic implemented in the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The code considers the scenario where the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price and handles it by printing the initial bourles held. Therefore, the program is correct.
