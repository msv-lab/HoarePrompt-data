Example Answer:
The value of `total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and adding `remaining_bourles`. Since the values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are given as positive integers, the calculation results in a positive integer value for `total_bourles`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer, and `total_bourles` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer, and `total_bourles` is a positive integer**
