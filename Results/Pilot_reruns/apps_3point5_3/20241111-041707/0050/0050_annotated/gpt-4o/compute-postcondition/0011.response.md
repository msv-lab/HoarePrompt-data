The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a value based on the following criteria:
- The function calculates the sum of all elements in list s and multiplies it by the sum of all elements in list b.
- If the resulting value is less than or equal to r, the function returns True.
- If the resulting value is greater than r, the function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the product of the sums of elements in lists s and b, and return True if the product is less than or equal to r, otherwise return False.
