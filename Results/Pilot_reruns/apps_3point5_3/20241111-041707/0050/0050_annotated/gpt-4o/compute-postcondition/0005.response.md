Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `r`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The values of other variables such as `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` remain unchanged.**
