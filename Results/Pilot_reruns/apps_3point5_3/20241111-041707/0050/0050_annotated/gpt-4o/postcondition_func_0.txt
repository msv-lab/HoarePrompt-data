The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum value in list `s` as `min_buy_price` and the maximum value in list `b` as `max_sell_price`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after the purchase, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. This total amount is then printed.
