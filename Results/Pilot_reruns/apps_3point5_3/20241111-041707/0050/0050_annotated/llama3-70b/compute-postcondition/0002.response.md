Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. The input is taken from the user, and the values are converted to integers. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers obtained from user input**
