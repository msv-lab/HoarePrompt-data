Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, `r` remains 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `s` has at least one element. In this case, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
