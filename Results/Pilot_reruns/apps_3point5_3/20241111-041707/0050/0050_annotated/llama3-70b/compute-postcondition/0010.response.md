Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `shares` is updated if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks. All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships.***
