Output State: 
After the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has at least one element.
After the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has at least one element.
After the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has at least one element.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has at least one element**
