According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
