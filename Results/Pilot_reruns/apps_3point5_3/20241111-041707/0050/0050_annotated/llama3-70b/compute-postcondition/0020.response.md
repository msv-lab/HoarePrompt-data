Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the result of `r` divided by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop. Ensure that the edge cases, such as `s[i]` being the smallest or largest element in `s`, are handled appropriately in the postcondition.***
