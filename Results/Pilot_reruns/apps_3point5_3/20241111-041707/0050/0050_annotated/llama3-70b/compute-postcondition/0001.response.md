Example Answer: 
The input is split by spaces and converted into a list of integers `s`. Since the initial state of `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, and `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers**
