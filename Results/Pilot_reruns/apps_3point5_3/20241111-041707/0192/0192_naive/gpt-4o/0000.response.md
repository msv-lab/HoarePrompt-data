Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x. It calculates this by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and then adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic works for all possible cases within the given constraints.
