Correctness: False

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program should find the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y, not just the absolute difference between x and y.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
6 3
Output:
3

Explanation:
According to the problem description, the correct output should be 4, as explained in the example provided. However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not provide the correct solution for all potential cases, making the Correctness **False**.
