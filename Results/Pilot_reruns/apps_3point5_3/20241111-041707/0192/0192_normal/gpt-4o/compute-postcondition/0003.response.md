Functionality: **The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, ensuring they satisfy 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). The function does not handle cases where the user input does not meet the stated conditions.**
