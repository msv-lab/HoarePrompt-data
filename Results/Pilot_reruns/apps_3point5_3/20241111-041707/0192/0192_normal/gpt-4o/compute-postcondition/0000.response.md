Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by mapping two integers inputted with a space in between. As per the given precondition, `x` and `y` are integers where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, after execution, `x` and `y` will have the values inputted by the user within the given constraints.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
