Example Answer:
x and y are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string by space and converting them to integers. Since the values of x and y are not specified, the output state is x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
