Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between x and y using the abs() function and prints the result. The initial state specifies that x is larger than y, so the output will be the difference between x and y. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
