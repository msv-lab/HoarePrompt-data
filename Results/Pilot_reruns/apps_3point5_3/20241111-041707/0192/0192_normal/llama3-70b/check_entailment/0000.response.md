Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints it. The problem description states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle in a single second to obtain an equilateral triangle of a different side length. Since the code simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths, it correctly determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` from the starting side length `x`. The code works for all potential cases defined in the problem description and the examples provided.
