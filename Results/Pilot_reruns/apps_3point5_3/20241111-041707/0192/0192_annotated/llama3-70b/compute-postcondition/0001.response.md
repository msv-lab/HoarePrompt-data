Example Answer: 
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is calculated and then printed. `x` and `y` are assigned values based on user input, so the absolute difference between them will depend on the input values. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are assigned values based on user input, and the absolute difference between them is printed.
Output State: **x and y are assigned values based on user input, and the absolute difference between them is printed**
