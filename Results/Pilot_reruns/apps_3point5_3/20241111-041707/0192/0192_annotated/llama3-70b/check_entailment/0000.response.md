Correctness: False

The provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input values x and y and prints the result. However, this does not match the problem description. The problem explicitly states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). Also, at any moment of time, the length of each side should be an integer.

The code does not implement the required logic of modifying the triangle sides to reach the desired equilateral triangle of side length y. It only calculates the absolute difference between x and y without considering the necessary steps to transform the triangle.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect. The annotations do not provide any influence on this decision as they simply describe the input and output without considering the necessary operations on the triangle sides.
