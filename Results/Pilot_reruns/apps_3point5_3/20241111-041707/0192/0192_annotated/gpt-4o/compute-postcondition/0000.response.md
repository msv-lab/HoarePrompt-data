Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by mapping integers from input. Since the precondition states that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the values entered will adhere to these conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
