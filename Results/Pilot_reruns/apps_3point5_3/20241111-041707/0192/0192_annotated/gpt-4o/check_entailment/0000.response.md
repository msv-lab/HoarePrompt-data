Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads two integers x and y from the user input, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, which aligns with the problem description. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x, which is achieved by the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). This formula correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, such as selecting the appropriate number of seconds to transition from one equilateral triangle to another. The annotations provide examples that align with the problem description, and upon analyzing these examples, the program seems to work correctly for all cases.
