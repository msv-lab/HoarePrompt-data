The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: If `remainder` is 0, then after the loop executes, the function returns a list `sequence` containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. If `remainder` is not 0, then after the loop executes, the function returns a list `sequence` containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, perform calculations based on the constraints provided, and return a list `sequence` according to the specified conditions.
