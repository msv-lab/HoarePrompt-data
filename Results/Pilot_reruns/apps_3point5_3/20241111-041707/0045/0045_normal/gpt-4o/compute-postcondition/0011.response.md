According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-1`, and if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` should be adjusted to `k-2` to meet the condition `i` greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-2`**
