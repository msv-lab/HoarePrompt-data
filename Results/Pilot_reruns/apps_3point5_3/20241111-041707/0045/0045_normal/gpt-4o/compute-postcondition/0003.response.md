Example Answer: 
`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is calculated as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is calculated as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`.**
