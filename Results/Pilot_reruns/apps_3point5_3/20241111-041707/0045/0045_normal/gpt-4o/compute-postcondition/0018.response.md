Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-3`, `remainder` is decremented by 1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks. This postcondition holds true for all possible edge cases and ensures the initial conditions are maintained.***
