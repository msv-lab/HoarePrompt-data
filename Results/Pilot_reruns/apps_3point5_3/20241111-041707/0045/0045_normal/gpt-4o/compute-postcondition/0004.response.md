Example Answer:
`d` is calculated as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. 
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`**
