According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-2`, `remainder` is decremented by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Since `i` is currently equal to `k-2`, to continue the loop for one more iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k-3`.

State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-3`, `remainder` is decremented by 1**
