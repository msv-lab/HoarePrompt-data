According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not directly impact the loop execution, but they are used to calculate the loop variables. In this case, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 1, and `i` should be equal to `k-1`.
State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-1`**
