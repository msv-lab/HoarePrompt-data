The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. After the loop executes, `a` will be the previous value of `b`, and `b` will be the remainder of the previous `a` divided by the previous `b`. The loop will continue to run until `b` becomes 0. If either `a` or `b` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `b` will remain unchanged. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop execution.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, performs a series of operations on them in a loop until `b` becomes 0, and then returns the final value of `a`. If either `a` or `b` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the initial values of `a` and `b`.**
