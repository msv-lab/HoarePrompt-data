Example Answer: 
The variables `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, while `b` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by the previous value of `b`. Since `b` is truthy, it means it has a value other than 0, so the operation is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the previous `a` divided by the previous `b`.
Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the previous `a` divided by the previous `b`**
