According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state does not provide information about the values of `n` and `k`. Since they are positive integers, they do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **no adjustments needed**
