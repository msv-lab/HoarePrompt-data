Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the new values of `a` and `b` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10**
