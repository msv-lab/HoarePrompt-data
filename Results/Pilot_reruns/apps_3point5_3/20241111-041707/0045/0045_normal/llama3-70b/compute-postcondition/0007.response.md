Output State: **If both n and k are positive integers with 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, after the loop executes: a will be the previous value of b, b will be the remainder of the previous a divided by the previous b. The loop will continue to run until b becomes 0. If either n or k is 0, the loop will not execute and a and b will remain unchanged. The function returns a.**
