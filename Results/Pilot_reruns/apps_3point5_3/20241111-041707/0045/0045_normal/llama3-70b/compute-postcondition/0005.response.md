According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the previous `a` divided by the previous `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, the new `b` value must be non-zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the previous `a` divided by the previous `b`**.
