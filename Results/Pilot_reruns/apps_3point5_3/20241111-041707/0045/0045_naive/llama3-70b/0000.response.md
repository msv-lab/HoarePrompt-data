Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1 as output which is according to the problem description.
3. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.
4. The program then prints the resulting sequence as output.
5. The logic of the program seems correct and it covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
