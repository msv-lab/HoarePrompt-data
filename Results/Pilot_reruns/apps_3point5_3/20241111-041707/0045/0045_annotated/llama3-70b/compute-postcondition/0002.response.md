Example Answer:
Initially, `a` holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` holds the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b` where `b` is not equal to 0. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, the value of `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and the value of `b` is updated to the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **`a` now holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` now holds the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b` where `b` is not equal to 0**
