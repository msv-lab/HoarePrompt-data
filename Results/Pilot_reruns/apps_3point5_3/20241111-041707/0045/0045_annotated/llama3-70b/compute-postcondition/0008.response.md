The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers. After executing the function body, `a` will hold the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` will hold 0, and the function will return the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculate their greatest common divisor, and return this value. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, calculates their greatest common divisor, and returns this value.**
