According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` now holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` now holds the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b` where `b` is not equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` now holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` now holds the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b` where `b` is not equal to 0**
