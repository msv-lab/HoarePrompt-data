Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k` and then checks if this minimum sum is greater than `n`. If it is, the code returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the sequence of numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor and returns it. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code logic and how the sequence is generated. All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.
