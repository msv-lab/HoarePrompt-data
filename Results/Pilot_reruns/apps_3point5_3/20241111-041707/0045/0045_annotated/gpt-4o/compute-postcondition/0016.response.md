According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is in the range from `k - 1` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` is currently at 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be -1.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` is -1**
