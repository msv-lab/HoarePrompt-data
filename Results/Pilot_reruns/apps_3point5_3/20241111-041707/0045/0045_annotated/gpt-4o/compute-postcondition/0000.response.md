Example Answer: 
`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is a positive integer. The formula calculates the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the minimum sum is calculated correctly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`**
