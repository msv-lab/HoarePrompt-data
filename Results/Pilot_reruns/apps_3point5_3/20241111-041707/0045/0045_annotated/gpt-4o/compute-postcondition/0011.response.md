According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` starts from `k - 1` and goes down to 0 in reverse order. If `remainder` is 0, the program execution breaks.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `i` value needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range of `k - 1` to 1 (since the loop stops at 0 in reverse order).

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` starts from `k - 1` and goes down to 1 in reverse order**
