Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input and compares their values, considering edge cases such as leading zeros, empty strings, and different lengths. The function prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b', or '=' if they are equal. The comparison covers all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure correct behavior of the program. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples.
