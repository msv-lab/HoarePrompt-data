Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input. It then compares the values of `a` and `b`, considering edge cases such as leading zeros, empty strings, and different lengths. The function prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b', or '=' if they are equal. This comparison covers all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure correct behavior of the program. However, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
