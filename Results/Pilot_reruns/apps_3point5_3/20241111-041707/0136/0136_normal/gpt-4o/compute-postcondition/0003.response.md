Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the string '0', but the leading zeros are stripped, so `a` becomes an empty string. `b` is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an empty string, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is an empty string, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits**
