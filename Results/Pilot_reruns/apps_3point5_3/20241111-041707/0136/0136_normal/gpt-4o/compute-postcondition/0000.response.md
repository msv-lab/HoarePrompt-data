Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function takes an input and splits it based on white spaces. The resulting list is stored in the variable `data`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits**
