Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` list with leading zeros stripped. If `a` is an empty string, it is reassigned to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. If `b` is not already assigned a value, it is reassigned to '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring correct behavior of the program.***
