Example Answer: 
The code removes leading zeros from the input string `a`. The value of `a` could have leading zeros at the beginning, and after the execution of the code, those leading zeros will be removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
