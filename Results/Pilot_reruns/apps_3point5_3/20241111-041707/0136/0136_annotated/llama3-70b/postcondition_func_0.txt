Functionality: The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, represented as strings with no leading zeroes. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function covers all possible comparison scenarios between `a` and `b` when they are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeroes. No specific operation or return value is provided beyond the print statements.
