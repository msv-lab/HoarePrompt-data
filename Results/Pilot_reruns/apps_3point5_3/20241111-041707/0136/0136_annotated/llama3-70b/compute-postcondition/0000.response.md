Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and leading zeroes are removed using `lstrip('0')`. The variable `a` is assigned this modified input value. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes**
