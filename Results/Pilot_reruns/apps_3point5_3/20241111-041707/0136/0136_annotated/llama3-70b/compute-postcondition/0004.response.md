Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('>')` simply prints the character `>`. There are no variables being affected or changed by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes, `b` is the same non-negative integer as `a` with no leading zeroes**
