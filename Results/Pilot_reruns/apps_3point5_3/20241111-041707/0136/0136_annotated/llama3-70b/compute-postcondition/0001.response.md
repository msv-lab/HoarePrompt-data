Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, where `input()` accepts an input and `lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeroes from the input. As `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes, `b` will contain the same value as `a` after removing any leading zeroes. Therefore, the output state is `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes, `b` is the same non-negative integer as `a` with no leading zeroes.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeroes, `b` is the same non-negative integer as `a` with no leading zeroes**
