Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are derived from `data[0]` and `data[1]` respectively after removing leading zeros. If `a` is empty, then `a` is assigned the string '0'. If `b` is empty, then both `a` and `b` are assigned the string '0'. Otherwise, `b` retains its previous value. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>', otherwise it prints '='. All cases are handled including when `a` and `b` are empty or have non-numeric values after removing leading zeros.***
