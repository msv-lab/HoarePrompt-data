Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned as `'0'`, and since the leading zeros are already removed from `'0'`, the value of `a` remains as `'0'`. The value of `b` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is '0', `b` retains its previous value.
Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` retains its previous value**
