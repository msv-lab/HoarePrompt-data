Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers from input and compares them correctly by removing leading zeroes.
2. It correctly handles cases where one number is shorter in length than the other.
3. It correctly prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b.
