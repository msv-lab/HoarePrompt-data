Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as input.
2. It then removes any leading zeroes from both a and b.
3. It compares the lengths of a and b, if one is shorter, it prints "<" or ">" accordingly.
4. If the lengths are equal, it directly compares the values of a and b and prints "<", ">", or "=" accordingly.
5. The program handles the case where a or b is all zeroes by converting it to '0'.
6. The program correctly prints the symbols "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison of a and b.
7. The program utilizes fast input/output methods by using sys.stdin.read for input.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all potential cases.
