According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, and `t_set` contains the unique characters of `t`. If the next character `c` in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated by adding `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` should be considered. If the next character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` contains the unique characters of `t`**
