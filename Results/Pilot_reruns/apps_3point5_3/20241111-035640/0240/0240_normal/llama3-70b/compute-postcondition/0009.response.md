Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated by adding the character `c`. The value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set contains the unique characters of t, and `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in s.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set contains the unique characters of t, and `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in s**.
