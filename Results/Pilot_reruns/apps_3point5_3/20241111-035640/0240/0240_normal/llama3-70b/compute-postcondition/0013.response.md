Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `t`. The previous value of `n` is either an empty string or contains characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. After the concatenation, `n` will contain the previous characters along with the characters in `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: If t_set is empty, the loop will not execute and `n` will remain an empty string. If t_set is not empty, `n` will contain characters from s that are also in t_set and the characters in t.
Output State: **If t_set is empty, the loop will not execute and `n` will remain an empty string. If t_set is not empty, `n` will contain characters from s that are also in t_set and the characters in t**
