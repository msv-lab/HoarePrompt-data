Example Answer: 
`n` is initialized as an empty string. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is an empty string.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is an empty string**
