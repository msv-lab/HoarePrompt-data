Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created by converting the non-empty substring `t` into a set. The previous values of `s` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t**
