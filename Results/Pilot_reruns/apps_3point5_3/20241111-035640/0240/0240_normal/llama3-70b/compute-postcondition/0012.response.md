Output State: **If t_set is empty, the loop will not execute and n will remain an empty string. If t_set is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character in s. For each character c in s, if c is in t_set, it will be added to n. After the loop finishes, n will contain all characters from s that are also in t_set.**
