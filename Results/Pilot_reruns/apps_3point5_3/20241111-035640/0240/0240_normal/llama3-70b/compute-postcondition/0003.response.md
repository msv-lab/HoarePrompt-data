Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is concatenated with the character `c`, so the new value of `n` will be the previous value of `n` followed by the character `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is a string equal to the current character c concatenated with the previous value of n.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is a string equal to the current character c concatenated with the previous value of n**
