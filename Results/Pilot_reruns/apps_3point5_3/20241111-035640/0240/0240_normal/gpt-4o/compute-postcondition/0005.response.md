Example Answer:
The `perm` variable is being joined together to form a string represented by `candidate`. As `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the result of the concatenation. The previous values of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`**
