According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings `chars` and `sub`. If both strings have at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the strings `chars` and `sub` need to be adjusted so that both have at least 1 digit. Additionally, as the loop involves permutations of `chars`, the loop will execute as long as `chars` has at least 1 digit.
State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit**
