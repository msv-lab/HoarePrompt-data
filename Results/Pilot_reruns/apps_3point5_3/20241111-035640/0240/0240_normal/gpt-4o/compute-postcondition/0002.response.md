Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` which represents the concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate`, the output state will simply be that the code yields the `candidate` without specifying the exact values of the variables.
Output State: **The code yields the candidate**
