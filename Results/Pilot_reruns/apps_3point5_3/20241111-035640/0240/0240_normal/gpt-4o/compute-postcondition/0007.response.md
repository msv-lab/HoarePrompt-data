Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with `sub` being a valid substring of `candidate`, then the function yields `candidate`.***
