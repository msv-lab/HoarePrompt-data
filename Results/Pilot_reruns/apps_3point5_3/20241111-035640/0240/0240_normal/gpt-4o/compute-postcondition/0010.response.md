Example Answer: 
The code snippet uses the `yield` keyword to generate and return `candidate`, which is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. The initial state includes `chars` as a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, and `sub` as a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit. After running the code snippet, the output state will be: `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`**
