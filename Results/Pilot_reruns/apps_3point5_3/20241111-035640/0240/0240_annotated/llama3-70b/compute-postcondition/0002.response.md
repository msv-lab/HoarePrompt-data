According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in string `s`. In this case, the loop will execute if string `s` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the set `t_set` containing unique elements from string `t` does not have any direct impact on the loop execution. Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `s` should not be an empty string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string `''`**
