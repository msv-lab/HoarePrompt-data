According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the character `c`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` needs to have more characters left, so the state that needs to be adjusted is the presence of more characters in `s`.
State: **`s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`**
