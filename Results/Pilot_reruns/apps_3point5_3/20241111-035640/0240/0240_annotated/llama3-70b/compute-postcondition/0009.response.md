Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`. This means `n` will now hold the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c`**
