The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, if `t_set` is empty or `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. If `t_set` is not empty and `s` contains characters, the variable `n` will contain all characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. `s` remains unchanged, `t` and `t_set` remain the same, and the function returns the integer value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of `n` based on the conditions mentioned.
