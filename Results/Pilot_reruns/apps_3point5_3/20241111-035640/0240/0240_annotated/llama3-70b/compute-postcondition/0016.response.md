Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two string parameters `s` and `t`. It creates a set `t_set` containing unique elements from string `t`. Then, it iterates through each character in string `s` and appends it to a new string `n` if the character is present in the set `t_set`. After the loop, it appends string `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. The function handles cases where `t_set` is empty or `s` is an empty string by not executing the loop. If `t_set` is not empty and `s` contains characters, it constructs `n` based on the characters present in both `s` and `t_set`.**
