Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm`, which is the first permutation of `chars`. The value of `chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`. 
Output State: **chars is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, perm is the first permutation of chars, candidate is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of chars**
