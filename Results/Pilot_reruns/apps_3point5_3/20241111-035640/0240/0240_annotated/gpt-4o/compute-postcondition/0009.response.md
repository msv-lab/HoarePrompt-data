Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. The `perm` variable represents the next permutation after the current one, and `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate. Assuming `perm` contains the characters '123', 'candidate' will be '123'. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, `candidate` is '123'.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, `candidate` is '123'**
