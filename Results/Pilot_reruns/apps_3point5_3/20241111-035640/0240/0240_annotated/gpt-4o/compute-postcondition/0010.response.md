Example Answer:
The code yields the current value of `candidate`, which is '123'. The variables `chars` and `perm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, `candidate` is '123'.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, `candidate` is '123'**
