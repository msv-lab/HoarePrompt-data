According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the string chars is not empty. Since chars is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that perm is the first permutation of the string chars.
State: **chars is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, perm is the first permutation of chars**.
