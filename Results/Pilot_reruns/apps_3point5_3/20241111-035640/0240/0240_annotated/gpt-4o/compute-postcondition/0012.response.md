According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, and `candidate` is '123'. For the loop to execute one more time, the `perm` needs to be adjusted to the next permutation after the one currently stored. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current one, `candidate` is '123'**
