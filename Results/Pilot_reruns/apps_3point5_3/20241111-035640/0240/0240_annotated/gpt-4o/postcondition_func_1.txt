The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub. It checks if the substring sub is present in the string num_str and if the length of num_str is equal to n_len, which is a value that is not defined or calculated within the function. Therefore, the function does not fully perform the intended validation as mentioned in the annotations. It validates the presence of a substring in the given string and compares the string length to an undefined value.
