You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the counts of characters in `s`
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the counts of characters in `sub`
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `s` and `sub` remain as strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `sub`, and `char` is the last character in `sub_counter`. If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the variables will remain unchanged.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` remain as strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `sub`, and `char` is the last character in `sub_counter`. If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the variables will remain unchanged.
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` remain as strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `sub`, and `char` is the last character in `sub_counter`
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` remain as strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `sub`, `char` is the last character in `sub_counter`, and `smallest_number` is assigned the smallest value from the `possible_numbers` list
    return smallest_number
    #State of the program after the return statement: `s` and `sub` remain as strings of digits, `n_len` is the result of the subtraction, `s_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `s`, `sub_counter` contains the updated counts of characters in `sub`, `char` is the last character in `sub_counter`, and `smallest_number` is assigned the smallest value from the `possible_numbers` list, and the function returns the value of `smallest_number`
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts two parameters, s and sub, which are strings of digits. It calculates the subtraction of the two strings, updates the counts of characters in s and sub, generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters, finds the smallest number from the list of possible numbers, assigns it to smallest_number, and finally returns the smallest_number.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #State of the program after the return statement: num_str is a string representing a very large integer, sub is a substring of num_str, and n_len is the length of num_str which does not exceed 1,000,000
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub. It checks if the substring sub is present in the string num_str and if the length of num_str is equal to n_len, which is a value that is not defined or calculated within the function. Therefore, the function does not fully perform the intended validation as mentioned in the annotations. It validates the presence of a substring in the given string and compares the string length to an undefined value.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to the state of `sub`, then the generator yields `candidate`. If `chars` or `sub` are empty strings, the loop will not execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two non-empty string parameters, `chars` and `sub`. It iterates over permutations of `chars` and generates a candidate string by joining the characters of each permutation. If the candidate string is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, the function yields the candidate. If either `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. The function does not specify a particular return value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
