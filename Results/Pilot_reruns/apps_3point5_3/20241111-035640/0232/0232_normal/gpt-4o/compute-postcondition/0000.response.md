Example Answer:
The code creates a dictionary `desired_counts` by zipping the range of 1 to `m` with the list `k`. The dictionary maps each integer from 1 to `m` to its corresponding value in the list `k`. Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, and `k` is a list of m integers, the dictionary `desired_counts` is created successfully.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k**
