Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `desired_counts` and `current_counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with an initial value of 0; left is 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with an initial value of 0; left is 0**
