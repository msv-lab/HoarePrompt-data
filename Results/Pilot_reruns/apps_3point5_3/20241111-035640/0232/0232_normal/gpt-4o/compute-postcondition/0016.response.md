Output State: If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for all colors at index `right`, the loop will execute again. `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` with their corresponding values in list `k`. `current_counts` is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to `m` where one color has a count less than desired_counts. `left` is at the index of the color with a count less than desired_counts, `right` is incremented, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1.
