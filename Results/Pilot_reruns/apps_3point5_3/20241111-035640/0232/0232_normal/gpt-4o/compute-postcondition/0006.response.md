Postcondition: ***desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to m, left is 0, right is 0. If all values in current_counts match the values in desired_counts for each color, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
