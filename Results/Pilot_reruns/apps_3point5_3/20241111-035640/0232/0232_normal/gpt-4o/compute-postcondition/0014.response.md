Output State: **If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for all colors, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` with their corresponding values in list `k`. `current_counts` is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to `m` where one color has a count less than desired_counts. `left` is at the index of the color with a count less than desired_counts, `right` is 0. If the loop control variable `left` exceeds the maximum index or the counts are not matching for any color, the loop ends and there is no change in the state of the program.**
