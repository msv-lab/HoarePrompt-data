**Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
- colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights.
- k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
