Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
