Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The variables `n`, `j`, `i`, `color` maintain their initial conditions as positive integers within the range, incremented values, and correct index values respectively. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. All variables retain their integrity and relationships as specified in the precondition, ensuring the correct handling of all possible scenarios. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop will not execute, and the values of `found`, `window_counts`, `j`, `color`, and `i` will remain consistent with their initial state.***
