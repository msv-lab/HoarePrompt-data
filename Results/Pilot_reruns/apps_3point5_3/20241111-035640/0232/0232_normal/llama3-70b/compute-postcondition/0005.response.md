Example Answer:
color_counts[color] is assigned the value 0. The color is the first color in the list, so the count of that color is set to 0. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, colors is a list of colors, color is the first color in the list, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, color_counts is a dictionary initialized with keys as possible colors and values as desired counts where the count of the first color is 0.
