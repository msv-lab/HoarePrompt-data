Postcondition: ***If the colors list is empty, `found` remains False. If the colors list is not empty, the loop iterates through the colors, updating the counts in `window_counts`. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. After the loop execution, `found` is a boolean indicating if all counts match their targets, `n` remains a positive integer, `window_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `j` is within the range of `i` to `n`, `color` holds the value at index `j` from the colors list, and `window_counts` increments the count for `color` if it was not already present. The loop handles edge cases where the colors list is empty or `found` is already True, ensuring proper functionality and variable states.***
