Output State: **n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of colors with at least 1 more color, color is the next color in the list, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. If color is not already in color_counts, color_counts[color] is now 0. The program state remains consistent with the initial values and conditions specified in the precondition. color_counts[color] has been incremented by 1.**
