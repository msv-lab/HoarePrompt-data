Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. After the execution of the if statement, if all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the state of `window_counts` remains consistent with the color addition logic. `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, and `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`. If `color` was not initially present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases of the given program fragment.***
