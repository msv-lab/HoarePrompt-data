Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, where color is the first color in the list. Since the initial value of color_counts[color] was 0 (if color is not already in color_counts), it will now be 1 after the increment. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of colors with at least 1 color, color is the first color in the list, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, and color_counts is a dictionary initialized with keys as possible colors and values as desired counts where the count of the first color is now 1 if color is not already in color_counts.
