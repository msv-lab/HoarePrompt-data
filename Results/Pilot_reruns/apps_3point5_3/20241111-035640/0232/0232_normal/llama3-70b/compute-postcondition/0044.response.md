Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. `n` remains a positive integer, `window_counts` maintains its updated counts, `j` is less than `n+1`, `color` holds the value at index `j` from the list `colors`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned 0 and incremented by 1. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes appropriately handles all edge cases related to the target counts verification mechanism.***
