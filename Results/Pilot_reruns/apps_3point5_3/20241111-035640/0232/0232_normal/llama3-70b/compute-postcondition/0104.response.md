Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean flag. If all counts in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True, `window_counts` has been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 1. The most internal loop or if statement is terminated and we break out of it.***
