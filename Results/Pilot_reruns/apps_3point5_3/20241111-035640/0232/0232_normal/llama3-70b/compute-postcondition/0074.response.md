Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. After the execution of the program fragment, if all counts in `window_counts` match their respective targets, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. The variables `n`, `j+1`, and `i` maintain their initial values. The variable `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list. If the color was already present in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 2; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. The variable `j` remains less than `n+1. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
