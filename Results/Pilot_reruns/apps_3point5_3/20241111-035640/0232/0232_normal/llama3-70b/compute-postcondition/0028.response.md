Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`. `n` is a positive integer. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count for each `color` key is incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its count remains unchanged.***
