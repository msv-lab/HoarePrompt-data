Example Answer:
The list `counts` is updated by mapping the input string into a list of integers. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
