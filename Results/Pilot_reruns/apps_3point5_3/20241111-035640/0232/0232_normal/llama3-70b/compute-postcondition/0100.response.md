Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean flag, `window_counts` has been updated to reflect the incremented count of `color` if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`, and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
