Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all the counts of colors in `window_counts` are equal to their respective targets, `found` is set to True. In this case, `n` remains a positive integer, `window_counts` maintains its updated counts, `j` is increased by 1, and `color` is assigned the value at index `j` from the list `colors`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. No changes occur if the condition is not met.***
