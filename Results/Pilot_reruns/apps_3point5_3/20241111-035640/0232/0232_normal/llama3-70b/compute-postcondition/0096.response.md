Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True, `window_counts` has been updated to reflect the incremented count of `color`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`, and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.***
