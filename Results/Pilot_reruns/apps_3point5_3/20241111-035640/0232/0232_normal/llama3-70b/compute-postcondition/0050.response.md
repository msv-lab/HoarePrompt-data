Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is within the range of `i` to `n`, `color` holds the value at index `j`, `window_counts` increments the count for `color`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is within the range of `i` to `n`, `color` holds the value at index `j`, `window_counts` increments the count for `color`, `i` is incremented by 1**
