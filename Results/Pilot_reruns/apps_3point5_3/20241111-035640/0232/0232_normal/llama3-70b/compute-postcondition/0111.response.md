Output State: **`found` is a boolean indicating if all counts match their targets, `n` is a positive integer, `window_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `j` is within the range of `i` to `n`, `color` holds the value at index `j` from the colors list, and `window_counts` increments the count for `color` if it was not already present. The loop handles edge cases where the colors list is empty or `found` is already True. 'YES' is printed if `found` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
