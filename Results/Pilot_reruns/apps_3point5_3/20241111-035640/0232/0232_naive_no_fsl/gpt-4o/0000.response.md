Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It iterates through the list of colors while keeping track of the count of each color. It then checks if there is an interval where the count of each color matches the desired count. If such an interval exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all potential cases by using a sliding window approach to find the desired interval. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and there are no specific cases mentioned where the program fails to meet the requirements, the code can be considered correct.
