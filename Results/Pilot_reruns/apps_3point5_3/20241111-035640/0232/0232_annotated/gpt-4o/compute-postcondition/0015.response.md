According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` had some counts less than the desired counts, `left` was at a value greater than 0, and `right` was at a value less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `right` index needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`current_counts` with some counts less than the desired counts, `left` at a value greater than 0, `right` at a value less than `n+1`**
