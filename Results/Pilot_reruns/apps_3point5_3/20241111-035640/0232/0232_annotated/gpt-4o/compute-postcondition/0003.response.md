According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is a valid index within the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with initial values of 0 for each key, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
