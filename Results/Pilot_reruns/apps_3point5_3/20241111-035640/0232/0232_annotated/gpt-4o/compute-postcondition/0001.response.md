Example Answer:
The variable `current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with an initial value of 0 for each key. The `desired_counts` variable is not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with initial values of 0 for each key.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with initial values of 0 for each key**
