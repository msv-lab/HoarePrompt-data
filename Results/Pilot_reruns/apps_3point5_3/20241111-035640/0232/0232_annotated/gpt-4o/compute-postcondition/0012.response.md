Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with incremented count for the color at index `right` and it is less than the desired count for at least one color, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all the incremented counts in `current_counts` match their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
