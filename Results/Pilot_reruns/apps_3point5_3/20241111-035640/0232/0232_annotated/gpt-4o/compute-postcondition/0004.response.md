Example Answer:
The value of `colors[right]` is used as a key to increment the value in the `current_counts` dictionary. The `right` variable is used as an index to access the color in the `colors` list. The values of `desired_counts`, `left`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with incremented count for the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with incremented count for the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
