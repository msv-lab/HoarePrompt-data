According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`, so the key state to adjust for the loop to execute one more time is `right`. At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is at a value less than `n+1`, which means it is at most equal to `n`. To execute one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`current_counts` has updated counts, `left` is at a value greater than 0, `right` is at a value less than `n`**
