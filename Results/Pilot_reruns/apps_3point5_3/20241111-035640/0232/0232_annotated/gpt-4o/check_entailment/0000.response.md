Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. The function `func_1` correctly creates a dictionary `desired_counts` mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input `k`. Then, it iterates through the range of `n`, updating the counts in `current_counts` based on the colors. The function adjusts the counts and the `left` index until all counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts` for every color or until the loop reaches the end of the range. If all counts match, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations also provide a clear understanding of the code's flow and the expected behavior at each step.
