Output State: **`found` is True, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
