Example Answer: 
The dictionary `color_counts` is updated with the key `color` and value `0`. If `color` was not already in `color_counts`, it is now added with a value of `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 2 colors, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and 0 is the value if color is not already in color_counts.
