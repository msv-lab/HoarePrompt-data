Output State: **`found` is True, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with incremented value if `color` is not present, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `j+1` elements, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
