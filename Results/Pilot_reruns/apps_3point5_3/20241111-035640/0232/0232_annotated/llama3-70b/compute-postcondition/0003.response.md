Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the count of each color present in the `colors` list. Since no values have been added to the dictionary yet, the output state is:
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is an empty dictionary**
