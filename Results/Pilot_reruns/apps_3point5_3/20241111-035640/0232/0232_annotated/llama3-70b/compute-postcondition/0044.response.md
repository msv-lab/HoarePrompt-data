Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts, then `found` is True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same value, `window_counts` is updated based on the specified conditions, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The postcondition also considers cases where the conditions are not met, but detailed changes or updates are not specified in the code.***
