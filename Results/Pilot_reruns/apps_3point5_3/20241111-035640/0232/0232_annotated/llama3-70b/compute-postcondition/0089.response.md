According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 2` and `i` is less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. All other states remain the same.
State: **`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key has a value of 0 if not present, and if `color` is not in `window_counts` after the if statement, then `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 3, `i` is less than `n`, `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `j+1` elements, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.**
