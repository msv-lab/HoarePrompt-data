Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts`, then populates the `color_counts` dictionary based on the input. It then iterates through different windows of colors to check if the counts match the targets. If a match is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a match was found, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
