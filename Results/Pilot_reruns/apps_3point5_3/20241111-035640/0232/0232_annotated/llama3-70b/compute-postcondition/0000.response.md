Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the input split by space. Since the input values are within the specified ranges, the output state is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n**
