Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not be empty, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` initialized to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the final state of the program after the execution of the if statement.***
