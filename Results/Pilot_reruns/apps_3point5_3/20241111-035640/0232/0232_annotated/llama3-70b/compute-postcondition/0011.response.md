Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 2 colors, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and the value is incremented by 1 if color is already in color_counts. If color is not already in color_counts, it is added with a value of 1.**
