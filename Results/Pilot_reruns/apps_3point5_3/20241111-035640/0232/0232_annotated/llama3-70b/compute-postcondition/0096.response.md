Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the `color` is added to `window_counts` with a value of 1. `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key has a value of `1`, `j` is equal to `i + 3`, `i` is less than `n`, `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `j+1` elements, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
