Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. `color` is added to `window_counts` with an incremented value. `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary. `n` is an integer greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key has an incremented value. `j` is equal to `i + 4`. `i` is less than `n`. `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `i + 4 + 1` elements. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 4]`. If all counts in sorted `window_counts` values are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` is True and the execution breaks. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0.***
