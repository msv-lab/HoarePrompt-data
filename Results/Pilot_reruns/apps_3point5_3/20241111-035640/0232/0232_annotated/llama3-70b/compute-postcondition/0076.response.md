Output State: **`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary. `n` is an integer greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is incremented by 1. `j` is equal to `i + 1`. `i` is less than `n`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` with key `color` is set to 0, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.**
