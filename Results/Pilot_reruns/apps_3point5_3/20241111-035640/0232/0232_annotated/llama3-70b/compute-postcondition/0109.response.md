According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color` is not in `window_counts`, and `n` is less than or equal to `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i`.
State: **`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color` is not in `window_counts`, `n` is greater than `i`**
