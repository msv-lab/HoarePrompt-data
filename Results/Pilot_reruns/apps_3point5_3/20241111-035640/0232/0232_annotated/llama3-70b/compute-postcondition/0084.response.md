Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary. `n` is an integer greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key has a value of 0 if not present. `j` is equal to `i + 2`. `i` is less than `n`. `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `j+1` elements. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. After the if statement, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. All initial conditions are maintained, ensuring the integrity of the program variables.***
