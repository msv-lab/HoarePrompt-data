Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state only mentions that `n` is a non-negative integer, the output state will be updated to reflect the new value of `n` after the input is provided.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer after the input is provided**
