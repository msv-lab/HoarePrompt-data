Functionality: **The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then based on the value of the remainder, calculates the result by either subtracting the remainder from `n` if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or adding `10 - remainder` to `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. The function then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
