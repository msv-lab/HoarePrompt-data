Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 is equal to 0, the program prints the value of n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to n. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the program prints the next multiple of 10 from n.***
