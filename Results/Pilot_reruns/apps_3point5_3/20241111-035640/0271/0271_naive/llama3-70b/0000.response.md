Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if the input number `n` ends with 0. If it does, it simply prints the number itself. If not, it rounds the number to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting or adding the remainder of `n % 10` to `n`. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program will always output a correct answer for any given input within the specified constraints.
