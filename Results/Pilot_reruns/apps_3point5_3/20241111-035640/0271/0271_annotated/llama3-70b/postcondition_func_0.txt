The function `func` prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer `n`. If n is a multiple of 10, it prints n. If n's last digit is less than or equal to 5, it prints n with the last digit removed. If n's last digit is greater than 5, it prints n rounded up to the next multiple of 10. However, the code does not specify any return value.
