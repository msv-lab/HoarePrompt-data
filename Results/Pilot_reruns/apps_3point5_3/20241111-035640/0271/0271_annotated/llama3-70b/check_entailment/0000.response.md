Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with a zero. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` with the last digit removed. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints `n` rounded up to the next multiple of 10.

The code annotations provide a clear explanation of what each part of the code does and how the program handles different scenarios. By comparing the annotations with the problem description, we can see that the code aligns with the requirements and covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.
