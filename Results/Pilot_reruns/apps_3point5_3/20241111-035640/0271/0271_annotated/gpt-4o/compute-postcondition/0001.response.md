Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, where `%` is the modulo operator that calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 10. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer assigned by the user input, so the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer assigned by the user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer assigned by the user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10**
