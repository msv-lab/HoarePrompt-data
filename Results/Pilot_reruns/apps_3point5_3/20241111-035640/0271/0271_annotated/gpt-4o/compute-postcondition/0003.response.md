Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Then `result` is assigned the value of `n` plus (10 - `remainder`). Since `n` is a non-negative integer provided by the user input, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9. Therefore, `result` will be `n` plus (10 - (`remainder`)). 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`)**
