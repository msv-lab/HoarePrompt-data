The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input and then prints different symbols based on certain conditions. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y but z is not 0, it prints '?'. If x does not equal y, it also prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and operates solely on the input values.
