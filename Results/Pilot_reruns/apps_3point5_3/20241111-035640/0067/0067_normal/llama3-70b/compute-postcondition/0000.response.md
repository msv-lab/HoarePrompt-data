Example Answer:
The values of x, y, and z are assigned by splitting the input based on spaces and converting them to integers. The input is expected to have three non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, the output state is x, y, and z are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100.
Output State: **x, y, and z are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100**
