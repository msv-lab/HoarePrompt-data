Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100. If x is greater than y + z, the program prints '+'. If x is less than y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z equals 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x does not equal y, the program prints '?'.***
