Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the number of upvotes is greater than the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, then prints "+". If the number of upvotes is less than downvotes, it prints "-". If the number of upvotes is equal to downvotes and there are no unknown votes, it prints "0". If the number of upvotes is equal to downvotes but there are unknown votes, it prints "?". Otherwise, it prints "?". The output hints also agree with the code and provide examples that validate the correctness of the code for different scenarios.
