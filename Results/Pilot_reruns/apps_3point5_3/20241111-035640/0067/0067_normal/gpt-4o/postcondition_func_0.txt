The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then calculates `min_upvotes` as `x`, `max_upvotes` as the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` as `y`, and `max_downvotes` as the sum of `y` and `z`. Depending on the relationship between `max_upvotes` and `min_downvotes`, the function prints '-', '+', or '?'. The function does not have explicit return values and operates solely through the print statements based on the if-else conditions. The code does not return any values.
