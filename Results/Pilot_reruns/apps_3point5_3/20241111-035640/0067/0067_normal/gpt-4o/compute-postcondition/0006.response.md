Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` remain as non-negative integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` also remain within their respective ranges; `min_downvotes` is still assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is still equal to `min_downvotes + z`**
