Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`, where `y` is the value of `min_downvotes`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. Therefore, after execution, `max_downvotes` is equal to `min_downvotes + z`. The output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `min_downvotes + z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `min_downvotes + z`**
