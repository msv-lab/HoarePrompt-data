Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when there are two possible results due to the unknown votes. In this case, the program should output "?", but it outputs "?" only when `x == y`, which is not always correct. For example, when `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 0`, the correct output should be "?", but the program outputs "-".
