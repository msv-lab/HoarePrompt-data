Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- For the first example (3 7 0), the program correctly determines that the result will be "-".
- For the second example (2 0 1), the program correctly determines that the result will be "+".
- For the third example (1 1 0), the program correctly determines that the result will be "0".
- For the fourth example (0 0 1), the program correctly determines that the result will be uncertain as there are two possible outcomes. 

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each scenario. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
