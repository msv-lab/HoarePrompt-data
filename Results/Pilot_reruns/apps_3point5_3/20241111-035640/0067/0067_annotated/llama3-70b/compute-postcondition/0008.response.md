Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x < y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?' without any further conditions.***
