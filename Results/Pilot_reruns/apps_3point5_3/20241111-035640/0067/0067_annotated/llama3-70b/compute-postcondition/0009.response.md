Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, the program prints '+'. If x is less than y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If none of these conditions are met, the program prints '?' without any further conditions.***
