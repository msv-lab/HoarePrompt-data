Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It takes three integers as input representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or unknown. It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input. Finally, it determines the result by checking if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, in which case it prints "-", if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, in which case it prints "+", and if none of these conditions are met, it prints "?". The code covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
