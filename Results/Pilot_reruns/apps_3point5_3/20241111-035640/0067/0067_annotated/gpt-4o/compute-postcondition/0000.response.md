Example Answer:
The values `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input split by space and converted to integers. Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state will reflect these values after the assignment.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100 based on the input split and conversion to integers**
