Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers x, y, z as input. It then calculates min_upvotes as x, max_upvotes as x + z, min_downvotes as y, and max_downvotes as y + z. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, it prints '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'**
