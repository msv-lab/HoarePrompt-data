According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3**
