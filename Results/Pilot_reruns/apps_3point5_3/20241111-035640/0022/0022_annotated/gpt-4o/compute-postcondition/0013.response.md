The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters. The function also requires `n` to be at least 2. 

In Case_1, the function checks if the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i` for all `i`. If any of these characters are not equal, the function returns False. The loop only executes if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

In Case_2, the function performs the same check as in Case_1. If all characters at symmetrical positions in the string are equal, the function returns True. The loop only executes if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters and check if the characters at symmetrical positions in the string are equal. It returns True if all characters are equal, and False otherwise, while ensuring `n` is at least 2.
