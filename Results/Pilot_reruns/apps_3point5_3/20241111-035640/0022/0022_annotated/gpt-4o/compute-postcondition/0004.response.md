According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 so that it is less than `n // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 2, i is 1**
