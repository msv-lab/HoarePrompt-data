The function `func` reads a string input, checks if the input string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it assumes the input string consists of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes in the input string.
