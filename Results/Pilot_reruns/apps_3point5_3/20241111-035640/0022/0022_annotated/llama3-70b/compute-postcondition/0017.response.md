Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]` at any iteration, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is exited. The program prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, otherwise it prints 'NIE'.**
