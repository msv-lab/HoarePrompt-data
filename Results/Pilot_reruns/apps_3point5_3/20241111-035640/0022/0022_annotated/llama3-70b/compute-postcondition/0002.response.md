Example Answer:
`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`, which is a boolean value indicating that a string is a palindrome. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True**
