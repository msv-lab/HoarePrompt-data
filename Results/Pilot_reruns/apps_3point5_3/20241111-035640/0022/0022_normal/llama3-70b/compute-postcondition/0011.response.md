According to the code, the loop will execute until `i` reaches half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `is_spalindrome` is True. If the loop is to execute one more time, the condition where `is_spalindrome` is set to False should not have been triggered. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True**
