Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This implies that the string `s` is not a palindrome from the given index `i`. The state of the program after the execution of the if statement covers all possible cases where the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, leading to the termination of the palindrome check.***
