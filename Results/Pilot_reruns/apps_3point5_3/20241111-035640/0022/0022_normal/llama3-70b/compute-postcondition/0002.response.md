Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True**
