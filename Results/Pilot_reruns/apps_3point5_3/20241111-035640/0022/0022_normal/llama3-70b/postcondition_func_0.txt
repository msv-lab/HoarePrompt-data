The function takes an input string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It then determines if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. If the string has a length less than 2, it does not go through the comparison loop.
