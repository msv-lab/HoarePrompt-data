Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1(s)` that checks if a string `s` is symmetric about the middle of the string. The function iterates through the characters of `s` from the start and end towards the middle, checking for symmetry. If the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The code also correctly handles cases where the length of `s` is less than 2, in which case no comparison is made. The code seems to be following the problem description accurately for all potential cases.

Additionally, the output hints align with the code by explaining the functionality of the `func_1` function and how it determines if a string is "s-palindrome". The hints provide a clear understanding of what the code is supposed to do, and upon examination, it seems that the code is indeed implementing the specified logic correctly.
