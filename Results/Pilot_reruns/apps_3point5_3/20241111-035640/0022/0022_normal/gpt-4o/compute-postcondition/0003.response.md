Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases where the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are not equal.***
