Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function and assigned to variable `n`. Since `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000 based on the length of the input string `s`.
Output State: **s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 1 and 1000**
