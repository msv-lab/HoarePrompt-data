The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function also accepts a parameter `n`, which is greater than or equal to 2. 

In Case_1, if the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function iterates through the characters from the start and end of the string towards the middle, checking for symmetry. If the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than 2, no comparison is made.

In Case_2, the functionality is similar to Case_1, but the function returns True if the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are equal, indicating that the string is symmetrical.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and an integer `n`, and determine if the characters in `s` are symmetrical when compared from the start and end of the string towards the middle. If the characters are symmetrical, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
