The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time when Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. 

After executing the function body, the function returns `min_wait_time`, which is initially set to positive infinity, and `chosen_route`, which is initially set to -1. These values will be updated based on the bus routes and Serval's arrival time to determine the minimum wait time and the chosen route for Serval.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time when Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route. It then calculates the minimum wait time and determines the chosen route for Serval.
