Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula provided. The value of `d_i` is not given, but it is subtracted from the result of `(t - s_i) % d_i`. The output state will be dependent on the specific values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The other variables (`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`) are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
