Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The variables `bus_routes` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`**
