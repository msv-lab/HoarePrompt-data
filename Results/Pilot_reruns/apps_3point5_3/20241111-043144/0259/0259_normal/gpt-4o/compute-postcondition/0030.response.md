Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is not defined in the initial state. The variables `min_wait_time` and `wait_time` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
