Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers where `i` is less than `n`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases for the calculation and assignment of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the conditions specified in the if-else block.***
