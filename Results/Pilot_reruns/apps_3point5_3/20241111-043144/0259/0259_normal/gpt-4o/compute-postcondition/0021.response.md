Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the value of `wait_time` is determined as follows: if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. In the elif part, if the condition `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` holds true, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, in the else part, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to i + 1. This covers all possible scenarios, including the boundary cases, ensuring the correct calculation and assignment of `wait_time` based on the given conditions.***
