Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `chosen_route`. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being less than or equal to 0, then `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
