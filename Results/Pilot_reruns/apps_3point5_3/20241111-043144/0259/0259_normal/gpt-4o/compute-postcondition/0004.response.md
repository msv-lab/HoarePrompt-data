Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are derived from `bus_routes[i]`. Since the initial state of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, and the values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i] and `wait_time` is calculated based on the assigned values of `s_i` and `t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the assigned values of `s_i` and `t`**
