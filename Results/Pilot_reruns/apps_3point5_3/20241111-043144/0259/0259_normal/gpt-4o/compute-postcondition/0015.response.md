Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `wait_time` is 0**
