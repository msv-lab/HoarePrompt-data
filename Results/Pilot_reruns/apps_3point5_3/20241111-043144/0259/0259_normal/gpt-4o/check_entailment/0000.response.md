Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the minimum wait time for Serval for each bus route and determines the chosen route based on Serval's arrival time.
- The code correctly handles the case where the number of bus routes is less than or equal to 0, in which case the function will not execute the loop and the chosen route will remain -1.
- The output of the code matches the problem description for all given examples.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.
