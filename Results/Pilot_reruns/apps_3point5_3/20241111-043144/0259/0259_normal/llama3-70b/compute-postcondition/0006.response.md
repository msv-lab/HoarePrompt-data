Example Answer: 
The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `s` and `d` are now integers. The variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple (s, d) where s and d are input integers.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple (s, d) where s and d are input integers**
