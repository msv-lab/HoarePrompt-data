Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_time` will contain the minimum time calculated based on the tuples in the `buses` list. `ans` will be the index of the tuple that resulted in the minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `min_time` will remain infinity, and `ans` will remain -1.**
