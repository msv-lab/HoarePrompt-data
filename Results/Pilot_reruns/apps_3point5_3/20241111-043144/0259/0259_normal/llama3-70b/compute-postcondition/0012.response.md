Output State: 

The loop reads input pairs of integers (s, d) and appends them to the list buses. After the loop executes, n will be between 1 and 100, t will be an integer between 1 and 10^5, and buses will contain tuples (s, d) where s and d are input integers. If n is 0 or t is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and buses will remain an empty list.
