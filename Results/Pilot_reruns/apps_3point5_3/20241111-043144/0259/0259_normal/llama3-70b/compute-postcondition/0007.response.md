Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list buses. The values of s and d are input integers, so after execution, the list buses will contain the newly added tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: n is between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, buses contains tuples (s, d) where s and d are input integers.
Output State: **n is between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, buses contains tuples (s, d) where s and d are input integers**
