Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem description. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus of each route, and selects the route with the minimum time difference. This logic ensures that Serval will choose the bus route that will arrive soonest after he reaches the station. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement, where Serval selects the bus route based on the arrival times and intervals of the buses.
