Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to determine which bus route Serval will use based on the arrival times of the buses and the time Serval goes to the station. However, the code does not return the correct bus route as per the problem description. 

One potential case where the code fails to provide the correct output is as follows:
Input:
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
2

In this case, the code incorrectly outputs 2 instead of 1, which violates the problem description. The annotations provide examples of cases that the code does not handle correctly, and in this case, one of those cases has been identified. The code should return the bus route that Serval will use, but it fails to do so in this particular scenario.
