Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input for the number of bus routes and the time limit for the journey, then calculates the number of bus routes that can complete the journey within the given time limit. The function outputs the count of such bus routes. The code does not adhere to the annotations as it does not return any value but prints the count directly. There is a missing return statement in the annotations.**
