Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values by splitting the input. Since n and t are positive integers, the values will be within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5**
