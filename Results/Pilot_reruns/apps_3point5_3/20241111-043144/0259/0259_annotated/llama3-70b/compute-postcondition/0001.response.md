Example Answer:
The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, buses is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, buses is an empty list**
