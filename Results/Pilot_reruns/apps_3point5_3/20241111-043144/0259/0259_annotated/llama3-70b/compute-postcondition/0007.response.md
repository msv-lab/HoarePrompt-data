Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
