Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` correspond to the second tuple in the list, `ans` is assigned the value either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison of `time` and `min_time`. `time` is calculated as the remainder of `(t - s) divided by d`, and `min_time` is assigned the minimum value between the previously calculated `min_time` and the current `time`***
