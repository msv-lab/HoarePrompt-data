Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` ranges from 0 to the number of tuples in `buses` - 1, `s` and `d` correspond to the tuples in the list, `ans` is assigned the value of the index of the tuple with the minimum `time` value (starting from 1), `time` is calculated as the remainder of `(t - s) divided by d`, and `min_time` is the minimum `time` value encountered so far. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list, `ans` stays at -1. `**
