Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuples `(s, d)` added in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `ans` is assigned -1.**
