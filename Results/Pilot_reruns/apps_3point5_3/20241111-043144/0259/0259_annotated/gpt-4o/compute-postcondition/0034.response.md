Output State: **If n is 0, the loop won't execute. If n is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through each bus route in bus_routes. For each iteration, wait_time will be calculated based on the conditions provided. min_wait_time will be updated to the minimum value of wait_time and the current min_wait_time. chosen_route will be updated to the index of the bus route with the minimum wait_time plus 1. At the end of the loop, min_wait_time will contain the minimum wait time among all bus routes, and chosen_route will be the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. The function returns chosen_route**
