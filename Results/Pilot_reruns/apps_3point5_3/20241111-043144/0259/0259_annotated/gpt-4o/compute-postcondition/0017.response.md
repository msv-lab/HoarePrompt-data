Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. min_wait_time is updated to the minimum value between wait_time and min_wait_time. chosen_route is assigned the value of i + 1, where i is the next value after the current last iteration. s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the ith tuple in bus_routes. The postcondition covers all edge cases, ensuring the proper handling of the wait_time calculation based on the conditions mentioned.***
