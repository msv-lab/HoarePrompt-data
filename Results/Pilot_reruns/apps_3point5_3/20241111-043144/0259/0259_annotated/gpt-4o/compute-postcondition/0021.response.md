Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. min_wait_time is updated to the minimum value between wait_time and min_wait_time. chosen_route is assigned the value of i + 1, where i is the next value after the current last iteration. s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the ith tuple in bus_routes. After the if else block executes, min_wait_time will be updated to the minimum value between the previous min_wait_time and wait_time. chosen_route will be updated to the value of i + 1 if wait_time is less than the current min_wait_time. All edge cases, including when wait_time is equal to min_wait_time, are covered, ensuring proper handling of the chosen route and minimum wait time.***
