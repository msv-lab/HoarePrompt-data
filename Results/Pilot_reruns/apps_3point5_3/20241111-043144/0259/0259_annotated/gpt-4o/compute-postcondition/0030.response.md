Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, chosen_route is now i + 1, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i. If s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.**
