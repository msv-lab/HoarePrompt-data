Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through each bus route in bus_routes and calculates the minimum wait time based on the conditions provided. The function then returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time plus 1. If n is 0, the loop won't execute. If n is greater than 0, the function calculates the minimum wait time among all bus routes and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. **
