Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is the minimum value between wait_time and min_wait_time, chosen_route is updated to the value of i + 1, i is the next value after the current last iteration, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the ith tuple in bus_routes, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i**
