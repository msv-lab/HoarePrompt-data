Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t**
