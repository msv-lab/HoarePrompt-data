Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, s_i is the source value from the tuple at index i, d_i is the destination value from the tuple at index i. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all cases where the wait_time is either 0 or calculated based on the given condition.***
