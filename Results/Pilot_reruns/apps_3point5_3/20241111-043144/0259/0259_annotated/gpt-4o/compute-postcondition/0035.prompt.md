You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route respectively.**
```
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
```
Output: If n is 0, the loop won't execute. If n is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through each bus route in bus_routes. For each iteration, wait_time will be calculated based on the conditions provided. min_wait_time will be updated to the minimum value of wait_time and the current min_wait_time. chosen_route will be updated to the index of the bus route with the minimum wait_time plus 1. At the end of the loop, min_wait_time will contain the minimum wait time among all bus routes, and chosen_route will be the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. The function returns chosen_route

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
