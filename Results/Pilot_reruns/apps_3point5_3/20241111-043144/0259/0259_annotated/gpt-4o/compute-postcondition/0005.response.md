Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, `s_i` is the source value from the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the destination value from the tuple at index `i`, and wait_time is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, `s_i` is the source value from the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the destination value from the tuple at index `i`, and wait_time is 0**
