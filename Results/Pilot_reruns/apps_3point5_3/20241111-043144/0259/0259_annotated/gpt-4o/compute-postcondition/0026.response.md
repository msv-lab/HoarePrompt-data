Example Answer:
The wait time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. The variables s_i and d_i are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The output state would be: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i**
