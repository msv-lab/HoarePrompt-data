Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the value at the index n // 10 in the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the value at the index n % 10 in the `ones` list. Since `s` is used in place of `n`, and `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, the output would be the concatenation of the tens digit and ones digit in string format.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the concatenation of the tens and ones digits in string format**
