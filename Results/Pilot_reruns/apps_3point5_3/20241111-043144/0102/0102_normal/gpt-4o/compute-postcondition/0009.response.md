Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the value corresponding to the input in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s is divisible by 10, the function returns the value at the index s // 10 in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string value at the index s // 10 in the list `tens` and the string value at the index s % 10 in the list `ones`.***
