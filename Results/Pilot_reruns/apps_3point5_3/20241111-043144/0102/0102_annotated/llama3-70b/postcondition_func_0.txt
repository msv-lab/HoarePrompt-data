The function `func` takes an input integer `s` and prints out the corresponding English word for the number represented by `s`. It handles cases where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, or greater than or equal to 20 by utilizing predefined arrays of words. The function does not return any value and solely focuses on converting the input integer to its English word representation.
