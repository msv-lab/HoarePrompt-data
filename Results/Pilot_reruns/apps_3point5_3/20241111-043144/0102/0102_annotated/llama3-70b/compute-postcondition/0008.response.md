Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the corresponding value from the `ones` array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the program prints the corresponding value from the `teens` array based on `s-10`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the combination of the corresponding value from the `tens` array and the corresponding value from the `ones` array with a hyphen in between if `s` is not divisible by 10. The postcondition covers all cases for `s`, including when it is equal to or less than 20, when it is a multiple of 10, and when it is not a multiple of 10.***
