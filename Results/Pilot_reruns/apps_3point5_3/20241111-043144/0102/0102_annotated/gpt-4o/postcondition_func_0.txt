The function func_1 accepts an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns the word representation of the number based on the specified conditions. It handles cases where n is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, and between 10 and 99. If n is divisible by 10, it returns the word representing the tens place of n. If n is not divisible by 10, it returns a string representing n in words by combining the word representing the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of n.
