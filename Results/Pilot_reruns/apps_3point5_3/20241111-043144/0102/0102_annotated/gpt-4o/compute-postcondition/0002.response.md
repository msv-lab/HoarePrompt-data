Example Answer:
The list `tens` is initialized with words representing tens from zero to nine. This does not change the state of the program other than initializing the `tens` list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine**
