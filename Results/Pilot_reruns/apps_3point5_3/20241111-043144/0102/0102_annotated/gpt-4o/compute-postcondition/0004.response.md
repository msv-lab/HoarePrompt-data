Example Answer: 
The function returns the element at index `n-10` from the list `teens`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, the value of `n-10` will be between 0 and 89, which corresponds to the index of the numbers zero to eight in the list `teens`. Therefore, the function will return the word representing the number from zero to eight based on the value of `n`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the number from zero to eight based on the value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the number from zero to eight based on the value of `n`**
