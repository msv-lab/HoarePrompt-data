The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function also contains a list `ones` that contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. After executing the function body, if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the word representation of the input number. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the word representing the number from eleven to nineteen. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing `n` in words by combining the word representing the tens place of `n`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the word representation of the number based on the given conditions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns the word representation of the number based on the specified conditions.**
