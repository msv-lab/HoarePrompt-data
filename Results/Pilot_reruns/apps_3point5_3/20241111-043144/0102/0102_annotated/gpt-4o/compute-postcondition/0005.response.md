Example Answer:
The code returns the element at index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `n` is between 0 and 99, `n // 10` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`**
