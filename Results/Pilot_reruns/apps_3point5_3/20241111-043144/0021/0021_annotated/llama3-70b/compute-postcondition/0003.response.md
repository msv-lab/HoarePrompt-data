Example Answer: 
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index` function. The value of `n` is an input integer, the list `a` contains input integers, and `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `posn` will be the index of `n` in the list `a`. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing input integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`**
