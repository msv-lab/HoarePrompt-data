Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the element 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. The list `a` contains the input integers, and `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the input integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the input integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`**
