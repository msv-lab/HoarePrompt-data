Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The input is assumed to be valid and consists of n distinct integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive**
