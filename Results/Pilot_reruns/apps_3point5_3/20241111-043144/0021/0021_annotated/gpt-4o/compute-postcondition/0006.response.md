Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of element n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of element n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between (n - 1) and the index of element n in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos**
