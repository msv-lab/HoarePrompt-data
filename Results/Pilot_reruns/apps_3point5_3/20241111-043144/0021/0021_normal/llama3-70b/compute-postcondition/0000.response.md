Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the precondition states that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, the value of `n` will be within that range. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which means the list `a` will contain integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order without repetition.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order**
