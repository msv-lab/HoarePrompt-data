Example Answer: 
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the value 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, the index of 1 in the list `a` will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0**
