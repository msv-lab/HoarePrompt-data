Example Answer: 
The value of `min_dist` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`. Since `pos1` is 0 and `posn` is `n-1`, the absolute difference is `n-1`. Therefore, `min_dist` is calculated as the minimum of `n-1 - 1` and `n - 2`, which simplifies to `min_dist = min(n-2, n-2) = n-2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is `n-1`, `max_dist` is `n-2`, and `min_dist` is `n-2`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is `n-1`, `max_dist` is `n-2`, and `min_dist` is `n-2`**
