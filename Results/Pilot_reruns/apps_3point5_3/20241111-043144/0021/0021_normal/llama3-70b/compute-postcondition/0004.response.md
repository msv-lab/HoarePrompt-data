Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between the absolute distance between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`. Since `pos1` is 0 and `posn` is `n-1`, the absolute distance is `n-1`. Therefore, `max_dist` will be the maximum value between `n-1 - 1` and `n - 2`, which evaluates to `n-2`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is `n-1`, `max_dist` is `n-2`**
