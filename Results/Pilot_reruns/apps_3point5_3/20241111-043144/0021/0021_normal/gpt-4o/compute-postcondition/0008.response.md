Example Answer: 
`max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are absolute differences between certain indices and values in list `a` based on the initial state. After calculation, the maximum distance value is stored in `max_distance`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4**`
