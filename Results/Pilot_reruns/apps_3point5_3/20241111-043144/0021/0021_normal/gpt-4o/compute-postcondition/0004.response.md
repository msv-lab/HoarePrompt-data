Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`**
