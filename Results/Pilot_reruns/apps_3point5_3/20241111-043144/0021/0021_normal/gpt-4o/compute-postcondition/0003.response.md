Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is provided as an input integer, so `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. The initial state also includes `a` as a list of integers and `min_pos` as the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
