Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. 

For example, if the minimum element and the maximum element are already at the opposite ends of the array, the code will still perform unnecessary swaps, even though the maximum distance is already achieved. The code does not check for this scenario and may give incorrect output. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
