Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering the absolute difference between their positions. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achievable after performing exactly one swap.

The logic of the program is sound and it covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. The program will work correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints.
