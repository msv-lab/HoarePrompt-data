The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the result of a mathematical operation involving n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The specific mathematical operation to be performed is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the result of a mathematical operation involving two positive integers n and k within the specified constraints.
