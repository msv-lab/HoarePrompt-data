Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it becomes `n + 1`. The value of `k` remains the same, and `x` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `k` to satisfy the condition `n % x != 0`. The specific value of `x` will depend on the new `n` and `k` values after incrementing `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer further incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `k` to satisfy the condition `n % x != 0`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer further incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `k` to satisfy the condition `n % x != 0`**
