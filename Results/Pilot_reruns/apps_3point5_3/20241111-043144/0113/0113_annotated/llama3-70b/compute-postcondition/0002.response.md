Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by 1. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but as `n` is a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is calculated based on the new value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is calculated based on the new value of `k`**
