Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8. The function calculates the value of `x` by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`, where `multiplier` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The output of the function `func_1` depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided as input. The actual output state may vary based on the calculation results rather than the predefined annotations.**
