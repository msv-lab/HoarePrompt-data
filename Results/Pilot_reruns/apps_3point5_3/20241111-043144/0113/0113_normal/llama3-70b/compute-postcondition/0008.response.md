Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between `x+1` and 10^9 where n % x = 0, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100,000,000** 

The loop will continue to execute until `n` is divisible by `x`, meaning `n % x = 0`. Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes will have `n` as the smallest positive integer greater than the initial value of `n` that is divisible by `x`. The variables `k` and `x` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution. 

If the initial value of `n` is already divisible by `x`, then the loop will not execute at all. This edge case should be considered in the output state as well.
