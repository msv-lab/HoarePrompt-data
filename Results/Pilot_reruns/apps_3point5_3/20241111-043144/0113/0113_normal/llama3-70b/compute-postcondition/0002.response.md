Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, after execution, `n` will be a positive integer between 2 and 10^9. The values of `k` and `x` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100,000,000**
