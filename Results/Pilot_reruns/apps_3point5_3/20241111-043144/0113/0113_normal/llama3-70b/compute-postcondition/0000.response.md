Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. The input is expected to be two positive integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `k` are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8**
