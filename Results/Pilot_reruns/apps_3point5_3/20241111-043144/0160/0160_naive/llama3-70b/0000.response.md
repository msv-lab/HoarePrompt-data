Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input sequence of integers A, finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements, and then calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. This is achieved by iterating over the divisors of the gcd and updating the max_divisor accordingly. The program handles all cases within the specified constraints and produces the correct output.
