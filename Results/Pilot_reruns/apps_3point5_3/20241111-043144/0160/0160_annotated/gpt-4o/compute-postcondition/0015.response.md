Example Answer:
The function returns the list of divisors sorted in reverse order. If x is 1, then divisors is {1}. If x is less than 1, divisors is {}. For x greater than or equal to 2, divisors contains all proper divisors of x. Therefore, after executing the code, the divisors will be sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **divisors is sorted in reverse order**
