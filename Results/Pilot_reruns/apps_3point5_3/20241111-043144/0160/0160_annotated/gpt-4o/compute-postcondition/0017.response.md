Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `x`, calculates the divisors of each integer in the list, and returns the sorted list of divisors in reverse order. The function correctly calculates the divisors for each integer in the list and sorts them in reverse order. However, it is important to note that the list `x` must meet the constraints specified (N is the length of the list, integers are within the specified ranges). Additionally, the function handles cases where x is 1 by returning {1} as the divisors, and for x less than 1, it returns an empty set {}.**
