Example Answer:
The value `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `i` ranges from 1 to N. Therefore, after running the code, the set `divisors` will contain integers from 1 to N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` contains integers from 1 to N, x is greater than or equal to 1**
