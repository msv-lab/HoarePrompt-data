Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` contains integers from 1 to N, x is greater than or equal to 1. If x is divisible by i, where i ranges from 1 to x, then both i and x // i are added to the `divisors` set.***
