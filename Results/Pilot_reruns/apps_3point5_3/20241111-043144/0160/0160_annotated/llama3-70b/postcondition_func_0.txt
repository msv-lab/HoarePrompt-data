The function `func` reads an integer `N` between 2 and 500 and an integer `K` between 0 and 10^9 from input. It then reads a list of integers `A` from input. The function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in `A`. It then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd by iterating over values up to the square root of the gcd and updating `max_divisor` accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
