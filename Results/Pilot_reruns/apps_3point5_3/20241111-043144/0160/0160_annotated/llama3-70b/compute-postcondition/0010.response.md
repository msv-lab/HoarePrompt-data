Output State: 
If N is 2 or less, the loop will not execute, and gcd will remain the same as the initial value. If N is greater than 2, the loop will execute N-1 times, and gcd will be the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of gcd and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1. 
Therefore, after the loop executes, gcd will be the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of gcd and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1.
**gcd is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of gcd and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1.**
