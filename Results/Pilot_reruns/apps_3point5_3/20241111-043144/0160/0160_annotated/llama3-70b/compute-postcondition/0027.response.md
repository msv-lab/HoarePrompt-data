According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i` is 4.
State: **`gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1. `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. `i` is 4**
