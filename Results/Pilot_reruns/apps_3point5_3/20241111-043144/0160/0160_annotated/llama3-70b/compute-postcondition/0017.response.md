According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and make sure it is still less than or equal to the integer square root of `gcd`.
State: **`gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.**
