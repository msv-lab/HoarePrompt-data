Postcondition: ***`gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`.***
