According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and A[i], and `i` is 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input; gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and A[i], i is 3**
