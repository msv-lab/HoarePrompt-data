Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input as described in the problem statement.
2. It calculates the sum of the input sequence of integers A.
3. The program then defines two functions func_1 and func_2 to calculate the greatest common divisor of the elements in A and the divisors of the sum of A respectively.
4. It then iterates through the divisors of the sum of A and checks if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations described in the problem.
5. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it prints that divisor and breaks out of the loop.
6. The program outputs the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

The program logic seems correct and it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
