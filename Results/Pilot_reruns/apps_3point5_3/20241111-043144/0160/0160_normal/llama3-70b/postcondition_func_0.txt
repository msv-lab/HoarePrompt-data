The function `func` reads two integers N and K from input, followed by a list of N integers. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the integers in the list. After finding the gcd, it determines the maximum divisor of the gcd up to its square root and prints this maximum divisor. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates based on the input values. The function handles cases where N is less than 2 by keeping the maximum divisor as the gcd itself.
