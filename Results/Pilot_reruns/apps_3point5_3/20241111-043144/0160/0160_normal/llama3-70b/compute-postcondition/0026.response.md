Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `i` should be incremented by 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between its current value and `gcd // i`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables after the if else block executes.***
