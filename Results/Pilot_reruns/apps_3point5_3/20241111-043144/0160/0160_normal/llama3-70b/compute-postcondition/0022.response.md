According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a perfect square. Thus, the square root of `gcd` would be an integer value. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `i` should be incremented by 1**
