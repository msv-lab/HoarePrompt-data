Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2. After the execution of the if block, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value among the initial `max_divisor`, `gcd // i`, and `gcd // (gcd // (i + 1))`, where `i` is a divisor of `gcd` such that `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. This ensures that `max_divisor` reflects the highest possible divisor of `gcd` based on the given conditions.***
