According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to its current value plus 1. 
State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
