The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the predefined constraints and relationships provided. The function is expected to handle a scenario where N and K are integers within the range of 2 to 500 and 0 to 10^9 respectively. Additionally, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^6.

Given these constraints, the function `func` is expected to perform certain operations based on these predefined values, but since there are no specific instructions provided on the exact functionality, the precise return value or operation of the function cannot be determined without further details.
