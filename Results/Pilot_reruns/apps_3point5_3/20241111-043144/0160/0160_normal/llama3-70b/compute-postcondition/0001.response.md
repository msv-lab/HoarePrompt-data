Example Answer:
The list A is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers**
