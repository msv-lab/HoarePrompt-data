Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor`, `gcd // (i + 1)`, and `gcd // (gcd // (i + 1))`, where `i` is a divisor of `gcd`. The output state is: `gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the updated maximum value based on the calculation.
Output State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the updated maximum value based on the calculation**
