Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is a perfect square and `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, we can calculate the value of `max_divisor` based on this information.
Output State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, `max_divisor` is the updated maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`**
