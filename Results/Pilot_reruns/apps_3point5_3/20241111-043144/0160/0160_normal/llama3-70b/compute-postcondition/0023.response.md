Example Answer: 
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` should be incremented by 1, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum of its current value and `i+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i+1`.
Output State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i+1`**
