According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor`, `gcd // i`, and `gcd // (gcd // i)`, where `i` is a divisor of `gcd`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, which means `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor`, `gcd // (i + 1)`, and `gcd // (gcd // (i + 1))`, where `i` is a divisor of `gcd`**
