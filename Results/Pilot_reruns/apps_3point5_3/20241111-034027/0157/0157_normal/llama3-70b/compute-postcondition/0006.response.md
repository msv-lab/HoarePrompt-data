Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum value between `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. Finally, it prints the result of a specific arithmetic operation involving the minimum value calculated. The function has the precondition that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers within a specific range. However, it does not return any value.**
