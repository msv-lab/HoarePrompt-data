Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The value of `min_lemon` is the minimum value among the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among the inputs.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among the inputs**
