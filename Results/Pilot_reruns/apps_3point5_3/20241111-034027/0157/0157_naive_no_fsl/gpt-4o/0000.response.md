Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by following the given ratio of 1:2:4. It identifies the limiting factor (the minimum of the three ratios) and then calculates the total fruits based on that limiting factor. The program accounts for the fact that the fruits must be used in whole numbers without being cut or broken. The provided examples also validate the correctness of the program.
