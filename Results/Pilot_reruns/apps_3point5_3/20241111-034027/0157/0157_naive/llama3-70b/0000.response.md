Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It first determines the minimum of the three ratios (lemons, apples, and pears) based on the available quantities. Then it calculates the total amount of fruits by multiplying the minimum ratio by the respective quantities. This logic ensures that the fruits are in the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The program handles all potential cases where Nikolay may not have enough of one type of fruit to cook any compote. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description for all possible inputs.
