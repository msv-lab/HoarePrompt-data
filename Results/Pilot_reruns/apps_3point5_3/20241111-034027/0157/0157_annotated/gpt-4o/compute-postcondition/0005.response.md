Example Answer: 
The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is dependent on the value of `max_lemons`. The initial states of `a` and `b` are not used for the calculation. The output will be the value of `total_fruits` based on the value of `max_lemons`.
Output State: **The code will print the value of `total_fruits` based on the value of `max_lemons`**
