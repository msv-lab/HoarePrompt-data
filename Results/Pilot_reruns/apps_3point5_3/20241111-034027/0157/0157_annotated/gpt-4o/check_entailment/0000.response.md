Correctness: True

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It takes in three positive integers a, b, and c, calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratios provided, and then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used. The output is the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The code handles the case where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote and outputs 0 in that scenario. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code and provide examples that align with the problem description. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
