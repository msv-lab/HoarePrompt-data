Functionality: ** The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers a, b, and c within the range 1 to 1000 each. It then calculates the minimum value among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, and prints the sum of this minimum value, double the minimum value, and quadruple the minimum value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
