Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates over each character in the English alphabet and replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. It then checks if the resulting string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet in order. If it does, it prints the result, otherwise it prints -1. This logic correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases where the input string can be transformed into the English alphabet as a subsequence.
