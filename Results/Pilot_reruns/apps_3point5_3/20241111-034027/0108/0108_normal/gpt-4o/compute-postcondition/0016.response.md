Output State: **If s contains the entire alphabet in order, then `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is 26. If s does not contain the entire alphabet or if s is longer than the alphabet, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26 or equal to 26. If s is shorter than the alphabet, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26. If s is empty, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
