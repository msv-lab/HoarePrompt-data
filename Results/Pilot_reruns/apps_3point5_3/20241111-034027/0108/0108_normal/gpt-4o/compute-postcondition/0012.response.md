Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target` and has been increased by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target` and has been increased by 1**
