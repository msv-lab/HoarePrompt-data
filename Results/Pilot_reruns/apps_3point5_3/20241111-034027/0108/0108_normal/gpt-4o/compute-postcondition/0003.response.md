Example Answer: 
Variables `i` and `j` are both assigned the value 0. The previous values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
