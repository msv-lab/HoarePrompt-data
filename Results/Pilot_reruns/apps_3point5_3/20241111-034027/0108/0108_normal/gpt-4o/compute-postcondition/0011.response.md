According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. 
1. If `i` is less than the length of string `s`, the loop can execute again.
2. If `j` is less than the length of the string `target`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 3, and `j` is either 2 or 3 based on the condition. 
For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of string `s`.
- `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of string `target`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target`**
