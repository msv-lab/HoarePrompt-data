Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
