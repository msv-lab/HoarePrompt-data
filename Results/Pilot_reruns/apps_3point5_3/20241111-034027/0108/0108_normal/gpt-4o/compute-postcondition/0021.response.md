Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters from the user input. It then iterates through the string `s` and checks if it contains the entire alphabet in order. If `s` contains the entire alphabet, the function prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` does not contain the entire alphabet or is longer than the alphabet, it prints -1. If `s` is shorter than the alphabet or empty, it also prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and its output behavior is determined by the content of the input string `s`. **
