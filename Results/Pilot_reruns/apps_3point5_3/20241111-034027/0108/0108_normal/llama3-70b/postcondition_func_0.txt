The function `func` reads a string input `s` containing lowercase English letters. It then iterates through the alphabet and for each letter found in `s`, it replaces it with the next letter in the alphabet, storing the result in `res`. If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints out the resulting string `res` with all letters in order. If `s` does not contain all alphabet characters, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.
