Output State: **If the input string contains all the characters in the alphabet at least once, then `s` will be an empty string, `res` will be the concatenation of all characters in the alphabet, and `char` will be the next character after 'z' in the alphabet. If the input string does not contain all characters in the alphabet, the loop will terminate early when `char` is not found in `s`, and `s` will be modified accordingly with only some characters replaced.**
