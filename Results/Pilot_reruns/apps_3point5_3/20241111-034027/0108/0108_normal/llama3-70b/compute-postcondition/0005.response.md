Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character obtained by incrementing its ASCII value by 1. The replacement is done only once. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the current character in the alphabet string; `char` is the current character in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the current character in the alphabet string; `char` is the current character in the alphabet string**
