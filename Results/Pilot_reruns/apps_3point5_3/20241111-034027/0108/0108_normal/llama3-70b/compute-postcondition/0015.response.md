Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the next character after 'z' in the alphabet, which is 'a'. Therefore, `res` now contains all characters from 'a' to 'z'. The value of `char` is now 'a'. The value of `s` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it remains unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is modified based on the previous iteration, `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', `char` is 'a'**
