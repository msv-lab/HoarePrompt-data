Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'char' in 's' with the next character in the alphabet after 'char'. If 'a' is present in 's', 'char' will be the character after 'a', 's' will have 'a' replaced by 'b', and 'res' will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a'. If 'a' is not present in 's', 'char' will be 'b', 's' remains unchanged, and 'res' contains all characters from 'a' to 'z'.
Output State: **If 'a' is present in s, res contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a', s is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', char is the next character after 'a' in the alphabet. If 'a' is not present in s, res contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', s remains unchanged, char is 'b'**
