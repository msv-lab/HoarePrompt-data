Example Answer: 
The current character `char` from the alphabet string is added to the `res` string. Since `res` is initially empty and `char` is the current character in the alphabet, after execution, the `res` string will contain the current character from the alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the current character in the alphabet string, `char` is the current character in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the current character in the alphabet string, `char` is the current character in the alphabet string**
