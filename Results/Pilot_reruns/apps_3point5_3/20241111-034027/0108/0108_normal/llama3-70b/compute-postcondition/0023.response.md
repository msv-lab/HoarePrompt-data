According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', and `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character that comes after `char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `char` is still present in the modified `s`.

State: **`s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character that comes after `char` and `char` is still present in `s`**
