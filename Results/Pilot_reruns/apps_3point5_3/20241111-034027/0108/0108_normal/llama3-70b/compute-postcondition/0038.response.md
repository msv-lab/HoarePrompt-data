Output State: **If the input string `s` contains all characters in the alphabet, then after the loop executes, `s` will be an empty string, `res` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, and `char` will be the next character after 'z' in the alphabet. If the input string does not contain all characters in the alphabet, the loop will terminate early, `s` will be modified accordingly with only some characters replaced. If `s` is an empty string or does not contain any alphabet characters, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.**
