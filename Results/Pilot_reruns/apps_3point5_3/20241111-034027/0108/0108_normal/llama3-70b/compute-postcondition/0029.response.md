Example Answer:
If 'b' is present in s, the next character after 'b' in the alphabet is stored in char. Then char is added to res. The variable res would contain all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b'. Meanwhile, s is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c'. 
Output State: **res contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b', s is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', char is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet**
