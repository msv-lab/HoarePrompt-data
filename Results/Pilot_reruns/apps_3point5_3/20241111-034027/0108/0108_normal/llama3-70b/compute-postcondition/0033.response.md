Example Answer:
The character 'b' in variable `s` is replaced with 'c' using the `replace` function with a limitation of 1 occurrence. Also, the variable `char` holds the next character after 'b' in the alphabet, which is 'c'. Therefore, after execution, `s` will have 'c' instead of 'b'. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`res` contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b' and the next character after 'b', `s` is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', `char` is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet and char is in `s**
