Example Answer:
`char` is added to `res`, where `char` is 'a' and `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z'. After the addition, `res` will now contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is modified based on the previous iteration, `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a', `char` is 'a'**
