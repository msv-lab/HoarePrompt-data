According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains the character 'c', `char` is 'b'. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `s` needs to be adjusted so that it contains 'b'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the character 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
