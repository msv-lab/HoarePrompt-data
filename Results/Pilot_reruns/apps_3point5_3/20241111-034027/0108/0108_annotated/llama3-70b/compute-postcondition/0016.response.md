Example Answer: 
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'c' in 's' with the character that comes after 'c' in the alphabet. Since 'c' is 'c', the character that comes after 'c' in the alphabet is 'd'. Therefore, after execution, 's' will have the first occurrence of 'd' if 'c' is present in 's'. The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the first occurrence of 'd', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bc', `char` is 'c'.
Output State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the first occurrence of 'd', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bc', `char` is 'c'**
