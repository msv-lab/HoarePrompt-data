Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous value of `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s`, and now `char` is appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of `char`.
Output State: **`res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of `char`**
