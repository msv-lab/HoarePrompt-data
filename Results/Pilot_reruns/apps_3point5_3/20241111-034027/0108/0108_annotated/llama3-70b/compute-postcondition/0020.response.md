According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is present in `s`, then `s` contains the first occurrence of `e`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bcd', `char` is 'd'. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `char` needs to be adjusted to a character that is present in `s` but not yet encountered. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the first occurrence of 'e', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bcd', `char` is a character present in 's' but not yet encountered**
