Example Answer: 
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, which is 'b'. So after execution, `res` becomes 'abb'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` still contains the character 'b' or 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` still contains the character 'b' or 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
