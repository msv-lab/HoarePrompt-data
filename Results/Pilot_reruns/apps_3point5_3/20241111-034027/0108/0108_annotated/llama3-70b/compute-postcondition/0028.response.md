According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, 'a' is present in 's', meaning the loop can execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the next character after 'e' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` still has more characters left, `res` includes characters beyond the current character in `s`, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet, and `res` appends `char` to include more characters**
