Example Answer: 
Since 'a' is present in 's' initially, the loop will execute. The loop will replace each character in 's' that comes after 'a' in the ASCII sequence with the character that comes after it. After the loop finishes, the value of `res` will be 'bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The variables `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` will remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains the first character that comes after 'f' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is a character present in 's' but not yet encountered where 'char' has been replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence in string `s`.
Output State: **`s` contains the first character that comes after 'f' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is a character present in 's' but not yet encountered where 'char' has been replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence in string `s`**
