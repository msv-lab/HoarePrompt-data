Example Answer:
The string `res` is concatenated with the character 'd', so after execution, `res` becomes 'bcd'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the first occurrence of 'd', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bcd', `char` is 'd'.
Output State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the first occurrence of 'd', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` includes 'bcd', `char` is 'd'**
