Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `char` to `res`. Since it is stated that `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet, and `res` includes characters beyond the current character in `s`, we can assume that `char` is the next character after 'e' in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the output state is: `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s`.
Output State: **`res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s**.
