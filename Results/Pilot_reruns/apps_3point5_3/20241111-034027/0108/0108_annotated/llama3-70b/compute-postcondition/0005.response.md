Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Since `char` is 'a', it will be replaced by 'b'. The `res` variable remains 'a', and `char` is updated to 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'b'**
