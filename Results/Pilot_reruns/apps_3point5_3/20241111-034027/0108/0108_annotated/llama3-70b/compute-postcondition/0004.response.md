Example Answer: 
After executing the code `res += char`, the character 'a' is appended to the string `res`, which was initially empty. Therefore, the value of `res` becomes 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of at least 26 small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
