Output State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the next character after 'e' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` still has more characters left, `res` includes characters beyond the current character in `s`, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet. If 'a' is not present in 's', the loop does not execute and the variables remain unchanged.**
