Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s` as input, iterates over the alphabet, replaces each character in the string with the next character in the ASCII sequence, and checks if the resulting string has a length of 26. If it does, it prints the string, otherwise, it prints -1. The program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement and the annotations provided are consistent with the actual code logic. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program.
