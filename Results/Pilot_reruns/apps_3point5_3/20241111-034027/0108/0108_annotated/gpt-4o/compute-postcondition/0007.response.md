According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]` or not. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of string `s`, and `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of string `s`, `j` is less than 26**
