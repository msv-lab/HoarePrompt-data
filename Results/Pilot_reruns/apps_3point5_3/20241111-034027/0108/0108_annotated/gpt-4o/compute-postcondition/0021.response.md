Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of small English letters. It then checks if the letters in `s` are in the same order as the English alphabet. If all letters are in order, it prints out the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the letters are not in order, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and its main functionality is to compare the input string `s` with the English alphabet.**
