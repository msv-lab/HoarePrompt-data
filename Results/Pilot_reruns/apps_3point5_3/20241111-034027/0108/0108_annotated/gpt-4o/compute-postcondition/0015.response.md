According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, and `i` is less than the length of string `s`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `j` is reset to 0 if it reaches 26. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of string `s`, and `j` is less than 26**
