According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the target length of 26. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, and `i` is less than the length of string `s`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` must still hold. If `j` is already at the 26th index of the target string, then `j` needs to be reset to 0 to continue matching the characters. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to reset `j` to 0 if it is equal to 26.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of string `s`, `j` is reset to 0 if it is equal to 26**
