Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If b is equal to a, then Vasya's favorite number is already in the sequence, so "YES" is printed. This case is handled correctly.
2. If c is equal to 0, then the sequence would be infinite where all elements would be equal to a, so Vasya's favorite number would not appear in the sequence. This case is also handled correctly.
3. If the difference between b and a is a multiple of c and the result is non-negative, then Vasya's favorite number can be reached in the sequence. This case is also handled correctly.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, then Vasya's favorite number cannot be reached in the sequence, so "NO" is printed. This case is also handled correctly.

Therefore, the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and works correctly for each case.
