Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed, and `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as integers within the specified range. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.***
