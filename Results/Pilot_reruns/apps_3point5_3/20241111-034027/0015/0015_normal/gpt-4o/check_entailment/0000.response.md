Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, which aligns with the problem description.
- The conditions in the code correctly check if `b` appears in the sequence `s` as described in the problem statement:
  1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'.
  2. If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO' which is also in agreement with the problem description.
  3. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, it prints 'YES'.
  4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.
- The code handles the cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the specified range of -10^9 to 10^9.
- The code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
