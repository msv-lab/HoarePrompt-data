Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through numbers from 1 to x, where x is incremented until a number cannot be formed using the available cubes. The can_form_number function checks if a particular number can be formed using the cube faces provided. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
