Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. The function `can_form_number` checks if all the digits in a given number can be formed using the cube faces, but it does not consider the restriction that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa using cube rotations. This restriction is crucial as it affects the maximum number that Masha can form.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as per the problem description, making the correctness of the code false.
