According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list must have more elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`found` is False**
