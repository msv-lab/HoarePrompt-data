Output State: **If `digit` is in at least one of the inner lists of `cube_faces`, then `found` is True and the loop breaks, setting the corresponding element in `used_cubes` to True. If `digit` is not found in any inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` remains False and all elements in `used_cubes` remain False. The loop will always execute n times, checking each cube face for the presence of the digit.**
