Example Answer:
All elements in the `used_cubes` list are set to `False` with a length of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values**
