Postcondition: ***If `digit` is found in at least one inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` is True and the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If `digit` is not found in any inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` remains False and all elements in `used_cubes` remain False. The loop always executes n times, checking each cube face for the presence of the digit.***
