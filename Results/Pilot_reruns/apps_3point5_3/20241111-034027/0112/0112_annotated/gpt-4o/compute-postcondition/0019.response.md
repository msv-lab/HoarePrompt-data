According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the first element is `True` after the first iteration, `found` is `True`, and `i` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `digit` should move to the next digit in the list `digits`.
- `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `True` if `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is True for the current `i`.
- `found` should be set to `True` if `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is True for the current `i`, otherwise, it should remain `True`.
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, the next digit in the list becomes `digit`, `used_cubes[i]` is `True` for the cube that meets the condition, `found` is `True` if the condition is met, `i` is incremented by 1**
