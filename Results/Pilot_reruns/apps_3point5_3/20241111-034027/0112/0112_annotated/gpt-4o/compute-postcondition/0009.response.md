According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`, as well as the condition `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the first element is `True` after the first iteration, `found` is `True`, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `True`, `found` should be set to `True`, and the loop should be exited.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the first element is `True` after the first iteration, `found` is `True`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
