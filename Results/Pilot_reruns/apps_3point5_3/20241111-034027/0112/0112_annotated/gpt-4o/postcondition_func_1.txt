Functionality: The function `can_form_number` takes two parameters: `n` representing the number of cubes and `cube_faces` as a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. It then checks if all digits in the given number `num` are present in the cube faces. If all digits are found, the function sets all elements in `used_cubes` to True and returns True. If any digit is missing in the cube_faces, the function returns False. In the case where `digits` has more elements than the total number of unique digits across all cubes, the loop will not execute. Potential edge cases or missing functionality could involve scenarios where cube_faces contain duplicate digits or if the input parameters are not valid, which are not explicitly addressed in the annotations.
