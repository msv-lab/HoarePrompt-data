According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least one more cube, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least one more cube.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the next cube**
