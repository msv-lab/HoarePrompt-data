Example Answer:
`cubes` is assigned a list of lists where each inner list contains integers converted from the input split by spaces, repeated `n` times. The value of `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input**
