According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input, and `digits` is an empty set. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being processed in the loop is the first cube in the cubes list.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the cubes list**
