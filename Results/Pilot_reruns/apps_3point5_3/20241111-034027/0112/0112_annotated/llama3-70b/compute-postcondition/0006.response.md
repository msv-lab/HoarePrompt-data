Example Answer: 
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representations of the digits in the next cube. The set `digits` now contains the string representations of the digits in the next cube. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the next cube.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the next cube**
