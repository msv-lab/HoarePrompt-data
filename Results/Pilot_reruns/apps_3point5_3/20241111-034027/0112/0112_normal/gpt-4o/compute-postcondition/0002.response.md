According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are digits in the `digits` list. To ensure the loop executes, the list `digits` must have at least 1 character. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`. 
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False**`.
