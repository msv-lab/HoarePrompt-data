Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized to `False`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False, `found` is False.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False, `found` is False**
