Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
