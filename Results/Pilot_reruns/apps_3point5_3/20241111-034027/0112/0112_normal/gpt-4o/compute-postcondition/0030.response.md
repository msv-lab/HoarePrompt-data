The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The function processes `num` by converting it into a list of digits called `digits`. The function also utilizes a list `cube_faces` representing the faces of cubes and a list `used_cubes` to keep track of which cube faces have been used.

In Case_1, the function iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. The function sets `found` to True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.

In Case_2, the loop iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found, the loop returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to process the input `num` and determine if the digits in `num` can be formed using the faces of cubes represented by `cube_faces` without using the same face twice. The function returns True if the digits can be formed and False otherwise.
