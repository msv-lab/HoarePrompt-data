Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character. The elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`. `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise. `i` is the index of the last checked cube face. If no digit is found, the function returns False. If `found` is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is less than the number of elements in `digits`, the loop will not execute for all values of `i` and the program exits without altering the variables.***
