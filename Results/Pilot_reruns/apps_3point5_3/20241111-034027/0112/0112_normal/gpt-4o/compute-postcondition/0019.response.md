According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 3**
