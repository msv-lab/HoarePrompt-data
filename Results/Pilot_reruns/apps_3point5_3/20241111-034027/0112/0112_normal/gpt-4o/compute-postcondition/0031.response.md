Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num` and processes it by converting it into a list of digits called `digits`. It utilizes a list `cube_faces` representing the faces of cubes and a list `used_cubes` to keep track of which cube faces have been used. The function then iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found in any cube face, the function returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.**
