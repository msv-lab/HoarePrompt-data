Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is directly assigned the value `True`, which means `found` is now `True`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` has the first element set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` has the first element set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 0**
