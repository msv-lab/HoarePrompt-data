Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character. The first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`. `found` is True, and `i` is 0 after the execution of the program fragment. In case the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
