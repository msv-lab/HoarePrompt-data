Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 1. If not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], then the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop is exited.***
