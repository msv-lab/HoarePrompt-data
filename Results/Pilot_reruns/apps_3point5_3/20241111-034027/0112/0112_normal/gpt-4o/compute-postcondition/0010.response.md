Example Answer:
The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to True. Since the initial state mentions that the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, it means that the first element has already been set to True, and now the value of `used_cubes[i]` is being set to True. Therefore, the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True, `found` is True, and `i` is 1.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True, `found` is True, and `i` is 1**
