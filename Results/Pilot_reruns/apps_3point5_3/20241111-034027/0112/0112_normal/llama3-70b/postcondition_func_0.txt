The function reads an integer n as input, then reads n lists of integers, each representing a cube. It extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in reverse order, joins them to form a number, and prints the maximum number that can be formed from these digits. If there are no cubes provided, the function will not execute the loop and will not print anything.
