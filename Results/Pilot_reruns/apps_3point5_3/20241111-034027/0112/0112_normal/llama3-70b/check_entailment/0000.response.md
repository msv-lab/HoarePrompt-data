Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem states that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations, but the code does not take this into account. For example, if there are two cubes with digits 6 and 9, the code will incorrectly allow Masha to form the number 96, which is not valid according to the problem description. Thus, the code is incorrect.
