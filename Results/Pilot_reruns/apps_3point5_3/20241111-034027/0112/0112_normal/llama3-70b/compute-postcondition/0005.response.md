According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cubes`. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least one sublist, `digits` is a set containing all the digits of all numbers in the list `cubes` as strings. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `cubes` must have at least 2 sublists.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least 2 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits of all numbers in the list `cubes` as strings**
