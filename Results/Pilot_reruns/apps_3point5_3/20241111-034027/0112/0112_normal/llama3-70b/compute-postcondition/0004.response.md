Example Answer:
`digits` is updated by converting each `digit` in each `cube` to a string and adding it to the set. The set `digits` was initially empty. Therefore, `digits` will contain all the digits of all the numbers in the list `cubes` as strings.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least one sublist, `digits` is a set containing all the digits of all numbers in the list `cubes` as strings**
