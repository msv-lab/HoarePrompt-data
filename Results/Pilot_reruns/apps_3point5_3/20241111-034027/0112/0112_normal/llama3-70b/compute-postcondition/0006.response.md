Example Answer:
The code iterates over each sublist `cube` in the list `cubes`, converts each integer in the sublist to a string, and adds each digit to the set `digits`. Since the initial state is not provided for `cubes` and `digits`, we cannot determine the exact values of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least 2 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits of all numbers in the list `cubes` as strings.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least 2 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits of all numbers in the list `cubes` as strings**
