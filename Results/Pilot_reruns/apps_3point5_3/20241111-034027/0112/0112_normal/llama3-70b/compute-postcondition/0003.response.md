According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least one sublist, the loop will execute. Since the digits set is empty at the start, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least one sublist. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least one sublist, `digits` is an empty set**
