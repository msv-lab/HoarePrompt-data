Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates through all possible numbers from 1 to x, checking if each number can be formed using the given cubes. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a number can be formed by checking if each digit in the number can be found on any of the cube faces. The program then returns the maximum number x that can be formed. The logic of the program follows the problem description and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
