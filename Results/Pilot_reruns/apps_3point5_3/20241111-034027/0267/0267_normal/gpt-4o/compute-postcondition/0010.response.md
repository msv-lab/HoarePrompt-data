According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by `l` and `r`. If `num` is within the range `[l, r]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is at the upper limit of the range `r`. To execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 to stay within the range `[l, r]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be increased by 1.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1`, `k`**
