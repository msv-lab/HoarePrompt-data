Output State: **If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for any `num` in the range `l` to `r`, then `total_sum` will be updated to the sum of those numbers modulo `MOD`. After the loop execution, `total_sum` will hold the final sum, while `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k` will retain their respective values.**
