Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum` and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The `total_sum` gets updated accordingly. The other variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on `func_1(num, k)`, `l` is the next number after the current `num`, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to the next number after the current `num`**
