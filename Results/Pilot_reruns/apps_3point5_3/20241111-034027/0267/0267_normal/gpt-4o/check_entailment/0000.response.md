Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions that match the problem description.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The function `func_2` correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The code handles the input values within the specified ranges.
- The code correctly utilizes the modulo operation with the constant `MOD` as required.
- The output hints agree with the code and provide valid examples that align with the program description.
