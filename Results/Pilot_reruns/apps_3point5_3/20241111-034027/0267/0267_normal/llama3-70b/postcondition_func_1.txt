The function `count` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. The function follows the following cases: 
1. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
2. If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the dictionary.
3. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp`. If `(n, k)` is not present in `dp` and `n` is less than 10, the function calculates and stores values in `dp` based on specified formulas.
