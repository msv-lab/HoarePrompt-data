According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values with updated value of `dp[n, k]`, `i` is equal to k-1**
