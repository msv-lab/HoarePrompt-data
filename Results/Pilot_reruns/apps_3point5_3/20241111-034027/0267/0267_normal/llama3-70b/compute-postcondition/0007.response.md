Example Answer:
The value `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` is added to `dp[n, k]`. The values of `n` and `k` are given in the initial state, but the value of `dp[n, k]` is not provided. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values with updated value of `dp[n, k]`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values with updated value of `dp[n, k]`**
