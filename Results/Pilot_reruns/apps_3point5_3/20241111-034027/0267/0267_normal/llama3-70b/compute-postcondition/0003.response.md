Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the dictionary.***
