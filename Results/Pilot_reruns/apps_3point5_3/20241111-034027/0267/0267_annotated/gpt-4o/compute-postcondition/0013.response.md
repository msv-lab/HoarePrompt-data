The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. 

After executing the function body, the variable `total_sum` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, update the variable `total_sum` based on certain conditions, and not execute the loop if `l` is greater than `r`.
