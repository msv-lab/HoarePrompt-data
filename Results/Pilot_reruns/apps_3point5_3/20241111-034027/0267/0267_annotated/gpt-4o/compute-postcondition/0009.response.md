Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `r`, `l`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 2)) % MOD`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and `num` is equal to `r + 2`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false, there is no change in `total_sum`, `l` remains `r + 1`, and `num` remains `r + 2`.***
