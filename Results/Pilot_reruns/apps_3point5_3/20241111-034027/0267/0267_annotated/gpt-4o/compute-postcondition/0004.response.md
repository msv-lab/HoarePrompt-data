According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated based on the condition `func_1(num, k)`, `l` is equal to `num`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `num` value should be `r + 1`, and no other states need adjustment.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` is equal to `r + 1`, `num` is equal to `r + 1`**
