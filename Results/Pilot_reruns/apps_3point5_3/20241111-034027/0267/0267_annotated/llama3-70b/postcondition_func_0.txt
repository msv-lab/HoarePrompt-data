The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. The function utilizes a dictionary `dp` for memoization. It then calculates the result of `count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)` modulo some variable `MOD` and returns this numerical result. The function does not modify the state of the dictionary `dp`. However, the functionality does not cover potential cases where the input parameters do not satisfy the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. Additionally, the actual implementation of the `count` function and the value of `MOD` are not provided in the annotations. Hence, there might be missing logic related to these components.
