Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The functions `func_1` and `count` are designed to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, as specified in the problem statement. The annotations provide a detailed breakdown of the functionality within the code, ensuring that the logic implemented corresponds to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected output of the program. The code handles scenarios where `l` and `r` are within the specified constraints and ensures that the sum of numbers meeting the criteria is calculated modulo `998244353`. Therefore, based on the code logic, annotations, and alignment with the problem description, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
