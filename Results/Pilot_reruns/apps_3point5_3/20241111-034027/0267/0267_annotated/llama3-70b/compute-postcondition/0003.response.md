Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. dp is a dictionary used for memoization. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp for that key. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. This condition covers the scenario where k is equal to 0, and in this case, the function immediately returns 0.***
