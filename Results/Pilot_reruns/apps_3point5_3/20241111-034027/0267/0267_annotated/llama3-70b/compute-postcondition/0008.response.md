According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. Since `k` is inclusive in the range, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] has been updated, i is 2**
