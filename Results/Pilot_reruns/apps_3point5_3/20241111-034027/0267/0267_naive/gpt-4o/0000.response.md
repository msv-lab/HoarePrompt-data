Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines the modulo value as 998244353.
2. The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number has at most k different digits.
3. The `func_2` function iterates through all numbers from l to r (inclusive) and calculates the total sum of numbers that meet the condition specified in the problem description.
4. The main part of the code takes input, calls `func_2` with the given inputs, and prints the result.
5. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.
