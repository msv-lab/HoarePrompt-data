Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the numbers that meet the criteria. The implementation of the `count` function correctly handles the calculation of the count of valid numbers with at most $k$ different digits. The main function correctly computes the final result by subtracting the count of valid numbers up to $l-1$ from the count of valid numbers up to $r$. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.
