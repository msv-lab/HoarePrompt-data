Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer), and finds the smallest multiple of `10^k` that is greater than or equal to `n`. It then prints this multiple. If `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, it remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but directly prints the result. **
