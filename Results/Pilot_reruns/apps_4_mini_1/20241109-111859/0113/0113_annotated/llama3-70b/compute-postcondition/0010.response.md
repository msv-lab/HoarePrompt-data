The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, the output is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`, but the specific return values or conditions are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer) and returns a result based on these input values.**
