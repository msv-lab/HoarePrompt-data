The value of `n` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be between 2 and 10^9 + 1. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
