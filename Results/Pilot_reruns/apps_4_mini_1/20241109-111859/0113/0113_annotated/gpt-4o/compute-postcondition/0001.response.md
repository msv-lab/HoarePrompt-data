To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression provided based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
   - `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8)
   - `multiplier` is calculated as `10 ** k`, which gives us `multiplier` values based on `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` calculates `x`.
   - First, we compute `multiplier` as `10 ** k`.
   - Then, we calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and `multiplier`.
   - After obtaining the gcd, we perform integer division of `multiplier` by this gcd.
   - Finally, `x` is assigned the value of `n` multiplied by the result of the integer division.

3. **Output State**:
   - The variable `x` is assigned a definitive value based on the calculations, while `n`, `k`, and `multiplier` retain their initial definitions.
   - Thus, the output state will encapsulate the values of `n`, `k`, `multiplier`, and `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `x` is calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))**.
