The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from `0` to `8`, the possible values for `multiplier` can be calculated as follows: 

- If `k` is `0`, `multiplier` is `1` (10^0).
- If `k` is `1`, `multiplier` is `10` (10^1).
- If `k` is `2`, `multiplier` is `100` (10^2).
- If `k` is `3`, `multiplier` is `1000` (10^3).
- If `k` is `4`, `multiplier` is `10000` (10^4).
- If `k` is `5`, `multiplier` is `100000` (10^5).
- If `k` is `6`, `multiplier` is `1000000` (10^6).
- If `k` is `7`, `multiplier` is `10000000` (10^7).
- If `k` is `8`, `multiplier` is `100000000` (10^8).

The state of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `n` and `multiplier`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 based on the value of `k`**.
