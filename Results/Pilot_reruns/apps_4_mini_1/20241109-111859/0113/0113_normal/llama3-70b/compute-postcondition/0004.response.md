The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` was already a new positive integer incremented by 1, after this operation, `n` will be increased to a new positive integer that is 2 greater than its initial value. The value of `x` does not change and remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new positive integer incremented by 1 (now increased by 1 again), and `n` is not divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer incremented by 2, and `n` is not divisible by `x`**
