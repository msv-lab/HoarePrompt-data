The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it operates with two implied parameters: `n` and `k`. 

`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information.

Since the specific output behavior of the function is not detailed, I cannot describe the exact return values. However, based on the constraints, we can indicate that the function processes the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two implied parameters, n (a positive integer from 1 to 10^9) and k (a non-negative integer from 0 to 8), but the exact output of the function is not specified.**
