The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a new positive integer incremented by 2, the previous value of `n` could be 2, 3, 4, etc. Therefore, after executing `n += 1`, the new value of `n` will be the original value plus 1. The state of `x` remains unaffected, and `n` continues to not be divisible by `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer incremented by 3, `n` is not divisible by `x`**
