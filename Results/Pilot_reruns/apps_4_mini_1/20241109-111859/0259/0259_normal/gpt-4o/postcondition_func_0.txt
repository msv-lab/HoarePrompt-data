The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time and duration of a bus route. It calculates the wait time for each bus route based on their start times and returns the 1-based index of the bus route with the smallest wait time. If all bus routes start after time `t`, the wait time is calculated based on the difference between their start time and `t`. If all bus routes start before `t`, it calculates the next available bus time based on their durations. If there are no valid bus routes, the function will return -1 (indicating no bus routes were found), as `chosen_route` remains at its initialized value of -1.
