The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` and `t` are known from the previous state, `wait_time` will be calculated based on their specific values. The previous value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and since `min_wait_time` has already been updated to `wait_time`, it indicates that `wait_time` is the new minimum. The variables `n` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `wait_time` along with the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1**
