The `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The formula used is `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` have been updated to new values from `bus_routes[i]`, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The calculation will yield a value for `wait_time`, but since the specific values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are not provided, we can only state that `wait_time` is determined by the equation provided. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `t` is a positive integer,
- `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`,
- `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`,
- `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`,
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
