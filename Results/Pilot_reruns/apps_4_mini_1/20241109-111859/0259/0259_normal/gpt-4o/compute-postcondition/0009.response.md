The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The previous values of the affected variables are `wait_time`, which is calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. Since `min_wait_time` is initially set to `float('inf')`, it will now be updated to the value of `wait_time`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`.**
