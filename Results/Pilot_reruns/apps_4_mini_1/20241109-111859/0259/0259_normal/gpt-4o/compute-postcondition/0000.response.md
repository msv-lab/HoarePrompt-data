The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This means that `min_wait_time` will be used as a starting point for comparisons, effectively indicating that any real number will be less than this initial value. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the newly assigned value of `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for each bus route i (1 <= i <= n); `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**
