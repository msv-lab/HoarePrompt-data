Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`; if `t - s_i` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Thus, the conditions for `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` will reflect the smallest wait time among the evaluated routes.***
