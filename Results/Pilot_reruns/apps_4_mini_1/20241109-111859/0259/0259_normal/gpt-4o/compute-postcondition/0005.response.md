The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `wait_time` and the preservation of the other variables' values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is 0**
