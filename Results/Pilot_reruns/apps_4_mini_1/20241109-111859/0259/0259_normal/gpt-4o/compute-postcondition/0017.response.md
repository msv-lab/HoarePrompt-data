Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` is equal to 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, accounting for the remainder of the time until the next bus arrives.***
