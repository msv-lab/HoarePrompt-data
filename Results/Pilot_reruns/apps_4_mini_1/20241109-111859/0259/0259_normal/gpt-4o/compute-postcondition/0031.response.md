Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` stays as it was. Additionally, `wait_time` is guaranteed to be non-negative, reflecting the waiting period based on the bus schedule.***
