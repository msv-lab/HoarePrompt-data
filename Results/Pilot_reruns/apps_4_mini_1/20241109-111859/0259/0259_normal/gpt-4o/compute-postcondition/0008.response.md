Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `t` minus `s_i` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus is arriving exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the next bus's wait time. All cases are covered, including when the bus arrives exactly at time `t` and when `s_i` is less than `t`.***
