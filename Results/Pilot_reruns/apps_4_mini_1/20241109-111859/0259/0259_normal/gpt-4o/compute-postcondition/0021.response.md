Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i]` with `i` incremented by 1. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This condition accounts for various scenarios where `s_i` may be greater than, equal to, or less than `t`, ensuring that the minimum wait time and corresponding route are correctly selected based on the calculated wait time. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
