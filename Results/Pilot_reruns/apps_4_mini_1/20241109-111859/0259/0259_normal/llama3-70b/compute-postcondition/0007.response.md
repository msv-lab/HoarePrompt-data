The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` contains one tuple, and `s` and `d` are input integers. After executing the code, the `buses` list will now contain two tuples: the original one and the new tuple `(s, d)`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the new value of `buses` includes the appended tuple.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**.
