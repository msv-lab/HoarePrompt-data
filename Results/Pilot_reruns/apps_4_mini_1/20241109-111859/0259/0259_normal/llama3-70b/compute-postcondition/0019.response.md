Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is either `infinity` or `time` depending on the comparison, `ans` is updated to `i + 1` if `time` is less than `min_time`, which indicates that the first bus is the earliest; if `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `ans` remains -1 and `min_time` is unchanged. In all cases, `i` is 0, and `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`.***
