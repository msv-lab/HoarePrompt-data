The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `t`, and the state of the `buses` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list**
