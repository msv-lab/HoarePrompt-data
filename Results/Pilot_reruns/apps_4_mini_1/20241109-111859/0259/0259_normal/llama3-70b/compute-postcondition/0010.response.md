The `buses` list is updated by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it. The previous state of `buses` is unchanged except for this addition. The values of `n` and `t` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of buses with the new tuple included.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
