Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated from the tuples in `buses` based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the 1-based index of the bus that has the earliest time; if `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop executes for all tuples; if `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains infinity and `ans` remains -1.**
