According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the current index `i` needs to be less than the total number of tuples in `buses`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` must be adjusted accordingly.

Since `i` is the index of the loop and is initially starting from 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, if the last value of `i` was `k`, it needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`. The number of tuples in `buses` must be at least `k + 1`.

The state of `buses` does not need to be modified because it already contains at least 1 tuple, which is sufficient for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time based on the available tuples in `buses`.

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is either `infinity` or `time`, `ans` is updated to 3 if `time` is less than `min_time`, `i` is incremented by 1**
