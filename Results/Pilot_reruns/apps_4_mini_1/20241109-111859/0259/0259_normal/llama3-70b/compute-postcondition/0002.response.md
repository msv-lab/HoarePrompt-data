According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The variable `buses` is currently an empty list, which does not affect the loop execution, but it will likely be used within the loop. There are no specific initial conditions for loop variables since the loop uses `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used.

For the loop to execute, the only requirement is that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which is already satisfied. The loop will start with the first iteration, and since `_` is not used in the loop body, there are no additional state adjustments needed for the loop variable.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
