The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input, which are split from a single input line. The initial state indicates that `s` and `d` are input integers, but their specific values after execution are not known until the input is provided. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates the assignment of `s` and `d` while maintaining the initial conditions of `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
