The code assigns values to `s` and `d` using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes user input and splits it into two components, converting them to integers. The values of `s` and `d` will depend on the input provided by the user. The initial values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `t`, and `buses`, along with the new values of `s` and `d` being assigned based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
