The `buses` list is updated by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it, where `s` and `d` are input integers. The original content of `buses` is preserved, and the new tuple is added to the end of the list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, and `buses` now contains the original tuple and the newly added tuple `(s, d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, and `buses` contains the original tuple and the newly added tuple (s, d)**
