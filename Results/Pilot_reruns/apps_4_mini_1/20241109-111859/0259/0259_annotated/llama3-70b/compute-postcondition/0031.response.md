Output State: **If `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` is updated to the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the tuples processed, and `ans` indicates the 1-based index of the tuple that yielded this minimum time. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains infinity while `ans` remains -1.**
