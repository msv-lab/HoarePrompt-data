According to the code, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, as it iterates over the range from 0 to `n - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the loop is guaranteed to run at least once. The loop variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, indicating that the value is not needed in the loop body. 

Since the list `buses` is empty before the loop starts, it will not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it may be modified within the loop. There are no specific states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute as long as `n` is within the specified range. The only relevant state is that `n` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list**
