The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are taken from the input, but they do not affect any other variables. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not changed, and the list `buses` will now contain one tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
