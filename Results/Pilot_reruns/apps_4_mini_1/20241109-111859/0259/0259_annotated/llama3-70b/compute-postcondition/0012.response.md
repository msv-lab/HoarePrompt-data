Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of integers (s, d) after the loop executes `n` times, where each tuple is derived from user input. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. If `n` is at least 1, `s` and `d` are positive integers from the input for each iteration.**
