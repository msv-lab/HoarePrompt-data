Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple of integers (s, d). If `time`, calculated as (t - s) % d, is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 1. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
