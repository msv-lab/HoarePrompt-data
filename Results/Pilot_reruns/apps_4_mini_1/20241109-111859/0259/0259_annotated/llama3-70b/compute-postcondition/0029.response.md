Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 3 tuples of integers (s, d), `i` is 2, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, there is no change to `min_time` or `ans`.***
