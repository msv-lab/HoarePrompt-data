According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Currently, `i` is equal to `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to `n` and it must be ensured that `n` is still a positive integer (which it is, as given).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `n` to reflect that we've completed the last valid iteration, and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n, `i` is n**
