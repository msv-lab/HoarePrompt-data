Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` containing pairs of integers representing bus schedules. It calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus route based on the given time `t`. If a suitable bus route exists, it returns the 1-based index of that route; otherwise, it returns -1 if no valid routes are found. If `n` is 0, it directly returns -1 without any calculations. **
