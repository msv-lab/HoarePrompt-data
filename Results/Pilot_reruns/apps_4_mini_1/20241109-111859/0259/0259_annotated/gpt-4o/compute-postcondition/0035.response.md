The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, which must be between 1 and 100. `t` is also a positive integer that represents the total time and must be between 1 and 100,000. The `bus_routes` parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i`, representing the start and duration of each bus route, respectively, with each `s_i` and `d_i` constrained to be between 1 and 100,000 for each route from 1 to `n`. 

After executing the function body, if the conditions for determining the minimum wait time are not met, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, returning -1 if no valid route is found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, and returns -1 if no valid bus route is found based on the given conditions.**
