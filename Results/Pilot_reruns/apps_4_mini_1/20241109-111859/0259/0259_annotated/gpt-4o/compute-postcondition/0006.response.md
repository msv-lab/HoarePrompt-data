The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. In this case, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. 

To determine the value of `wait_time`, we need the values of `s_i` and `d_i` from the bus routes. However, since they are not provided, we can only describe the relationship without specific numerical results.

The output state will reflect that `wait_time` is determined based on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. 

Output State: **`wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` using values `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**.
