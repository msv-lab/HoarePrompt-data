The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, which has been calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. Since the exact value of `wait_time` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `min_wait_time` to the previously calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`**
