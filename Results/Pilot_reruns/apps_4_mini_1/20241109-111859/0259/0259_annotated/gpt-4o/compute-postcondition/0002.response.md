According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the first iteration. 

The state before the loop indicates that `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, which are initial values. However, these values do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is, given the state), and `i` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n; `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity; `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is 0**
