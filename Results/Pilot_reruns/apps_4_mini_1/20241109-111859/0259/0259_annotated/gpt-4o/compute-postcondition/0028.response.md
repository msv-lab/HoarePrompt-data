Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `t` is equal to `s_i`, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`, then `wait_time` is 0. If `t` is less than `s_i` and not equal, then `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value. In all cases, `wait_time` remains non-negative.***
