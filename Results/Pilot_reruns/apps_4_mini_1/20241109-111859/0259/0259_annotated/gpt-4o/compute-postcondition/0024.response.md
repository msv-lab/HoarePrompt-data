The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The previous values are: `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer. The exact values of `s_i` and `t` are not given, but `s_i` is determined by the bus route corresponding to `i`, which is `n + 1`. Therefore, `wait_time` will be a calculation based on the specific values from `bus_routes[n + 1]` and `t`.

Since `s_i` and `t` are known to be integers, the resulting value of `wait_time` will depend on the difference between these two integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
