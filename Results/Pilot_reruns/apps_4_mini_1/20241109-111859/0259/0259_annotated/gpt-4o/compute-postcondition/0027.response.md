Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which represents the time until the next bus arrives, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value.***
