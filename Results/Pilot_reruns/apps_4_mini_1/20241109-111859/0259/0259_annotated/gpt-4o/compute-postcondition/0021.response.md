Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This covers all cases where `wait_time` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `min_wait_time`, ensuring that the minimum waiting time is accurately reflected along with the appropriate bus route selection.***
