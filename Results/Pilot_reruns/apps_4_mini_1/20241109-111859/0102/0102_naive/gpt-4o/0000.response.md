To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and identify any potential issues with edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program needs to convert an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its corresponding English word representation. The output must strictly follow the specified format, consisting of lowercase letters and hyphens, with no spaces.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']
    if 0 <= n <= 9:
        return ones[n]
    elif 11 <= n <= 19:
        return teens[n - 10]
    elif 10 <= n <= 99:
        if n % 10 == 0:
            return tens[n // 10]
        else:
            return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Ones Handling (0-9)**: The code correctly maps numbers 0 through 9 to their respective words.
2. **Teens Handling (11-19)**: The code correctly handles the numbers 11 to 19, but it skips 'ten' (which is handled in a separate condition).
3. **Tens Handling (10, 20, ..., 90)**: 
   - The program correctly handles multiples of ten, such as 10, 20, 30, ..., 90.
   - However, it does not handle the number 10 correctly in the teens section; it checks for `11 <= n <= 19`, thus bypassing 'ten' completely.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case for 10**: The number 10 should return "ten", but the current implementation does not provide a condition for it. 
- **Case for 11**: The number 11 correctly returns "eleven".
- **Case for 20**: The number 20 should return "twenty" and this is correctly handled.
- **Maximum boundary (99)**: The number 99 should return "ninety-nine" and this is correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly convert the score of 10 into the word "ten", it does not meet the requirements described in the problem statement for all potential cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case for the number 10 correctly, as it lacks a condition to return "ten".
