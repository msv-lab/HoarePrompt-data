Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is equal to 10, the function returns 'ten'. If `s` is 0, it returns 'zero'. If `s` is less than 10 or if `s` is equal to 10, the function correctly handles these cases without any errors. However, there is an error due to the undefined variable `n` in the code, which prevents the function from executing correctly.***
