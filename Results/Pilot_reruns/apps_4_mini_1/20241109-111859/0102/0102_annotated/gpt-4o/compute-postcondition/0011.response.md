The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. After executing the function body, the functionality of the function is as follows:

- If `s` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from `ones[s]`.
- If `s` is equal to 10, it returns 'ten'.
- If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`.
- If `s` is a multiple of 10 and is between 10 and 99, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`.
- If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`.
- If `s` is equal to 0, it returns 'zero'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its corresponding English word representation based on specific conditions for single digits, tens, and teen numbers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, returns the English word representation of the integer s based on its value, including specific handling for the ranges 0-9, 10, 11-19, multiples of 10, and non-multiples of 10 in the range 10-99.**
