Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens[n - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is less than 10 or equal to 0, the function does not execute any return statement.***
