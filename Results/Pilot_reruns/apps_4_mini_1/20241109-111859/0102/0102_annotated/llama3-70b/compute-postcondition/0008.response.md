Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the string representation from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation in the format of tens and ones, specifically `tens[s // 10]` followed by `''` if `s` is a multiple of 10, or `'-' + ones[s % 10]` if there is a non-zero remainder. All cases handle the range of `s` correctly, including edge cases for the boundaries of each range.***
