Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer within the range of 0 to 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function prints the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation based on the `tens` and `ones` lists, ensuring that if `s` is a multiple of 10, no hyphen is added. The program correctly handles all valid values of `s` without causing any index out of bounds errors, including edge cases such as `s` being 0, 9, 10, 19, 20, and 99.***
