To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze both the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to convert an integer score (0 to 99) into its English word representation. The expected outputs for different ranges of inputs include:
- For numbers from 0 to 9, it should return the corresponding English word (e.g., `0` -> `"zero"`).
- For numbers from 10 to 19, it should handle them specifically (e.g., `10` -> `"ten"`, `11` -> `"eleven"`).
- For multiples of ten from 20 to 90, it should return the corresponding word (e.g., `20` -> `"twenty"`).
- For numbers from 21 to 99 that are not multiples of ten, it should return a combination of the tens and ones (e.g., `23` -> `"twenty-three"`).

### Code Analysis:
The code defines a function `func_1(n)` to perform this conversion. Here are the relevant parts of the code:
1. It correctly defines lists for `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`.
2. It checks if `n` is between 0 and 9, returning the corresponding word from `ones`.
3. It checks if `n` is between 11 and 19, returning the corresponding word from `teens`.
4. It handles numbers between 10 and 99. If `n` is a multiple of ten, it returns the corresponding word from `tens`. If not, it combines the tens and ones with a hyphen.

### Edge Cases:
1. The code does handle the case for `0` correctly by checking it in the first condition.
2. However, there is a lack of explicit handling for `10`. The code checks if `n` is between 11 and 19, but it does not have a dedicated condition for `10`, which could lead to an incorrect output for this specific input.
3. The range checks within the `elif` statements could potentially lead to issues if the input is not explicitly handled.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function returns the English word representation for numbers from 0 to 99.
- It correctly mentions that for `n` between 0 and 9, the correct word is returned.
- It also mentions that for `n` equal to `10`, it returns 'ten', which is not explicitly handled in the code, leading to potential confusion.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all cases correctly, particularly the case for `10`. Even though it handles other cases well, the lack of handling for `10` leads to a situation where the program does not fully adhere to the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not correctly handle the input `10`, as it is not explicitly checked, and is instead only handled as a part of the general condition for 11 to 19.
