Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` array. Otherwise, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` array followed by a hyphen and the corresponding string from the `ones` array. This handles all cases, including `s` equal to 0 (which returns 'zero'), and ensures proper formatting for numbers in the range of 1 to 99.***
