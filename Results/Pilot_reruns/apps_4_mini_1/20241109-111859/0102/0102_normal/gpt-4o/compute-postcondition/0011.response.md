The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. After executing the function body, if `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string corresponding to `ones[s]`. If `s` is 10, it returns 'ten'. If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` array. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it returns the string from the `tens` array followed by a hyphen and the string from the `ones` array if `s` is not a multiple of 10. Additionally, if `s` is 0, the function returns 'zero'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its English word representation while handling all specified edge cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, and returns its English word representation according to specific rules for numbers between 0 and 99, including handling cases for 0, 10, and multiples of 10.**
