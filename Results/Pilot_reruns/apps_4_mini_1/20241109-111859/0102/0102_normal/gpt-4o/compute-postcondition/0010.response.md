Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string corresponding to `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` array. If `s` is 10, it returns 'ten', and if `s` is between 20 and 99, it returns the string from the `tens` array followed by a hyphen and the string from the `ones` array if `s` is not a multiple of 10. Additionally, the function handles the case where `s` is 0 by returning 'zero', thus managing all edge cases for numbers in the specified range.***
