Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 10 and 99, and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` array. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` array followed by a hyphen and the corresponding string from the `ones` array. Additionally, if `s` is 0, it will return 'zero', managing all edge cases for numbers in the specified range.***
