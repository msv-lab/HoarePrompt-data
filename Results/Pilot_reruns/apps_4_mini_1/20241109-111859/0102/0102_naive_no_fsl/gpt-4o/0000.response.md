To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and translates it into English words according to the following structure:

1. **Ones**: For numbers 0 through 9, it correctly returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
2. **Teens**: For numbers 11 through 19, it returns the words from the `teens` list. However, it does not account for the number 10, which should be returned as "ten". This is a critical issue because the problem description states that the input `s` can be 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, and the number 10 is included in this range.
3. **Tens**: For multiples of ten from 20 to 90, it returns the appropriate word from the `tens` list.
4. **General Case**: For numbers that are not multiples of ten between 21 and 99, it constructs the word by combining the appropriate word from the `tens` list and the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen.

Considering the above points, we can identify a specific case where the program does not adhere to the problem description:

- The input `10` should return "ten", but the code does not handle this case correctly as it falls under the range of the `teens` but is not included in the `teens` array.

Since there is at least one input case (specifically `10`) that the program does not handle correctly according to the problem description, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to return the correct English word for the integer `10`, which is a violation of the problem requirements.
