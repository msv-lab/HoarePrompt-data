The value of `dist3` is assigned the value `abs(0 - min_pos)`, where `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. The absolute difference is calculated, so `dist3` will be equal to `min_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `min_pos**
