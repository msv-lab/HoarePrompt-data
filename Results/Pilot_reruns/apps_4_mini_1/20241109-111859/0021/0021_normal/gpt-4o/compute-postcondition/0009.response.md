Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `min_pos`; `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`; and the function prints `max_distance`.**
