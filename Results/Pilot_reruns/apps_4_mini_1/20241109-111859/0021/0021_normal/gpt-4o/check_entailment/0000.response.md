To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the code.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

### Code Analysis
The code reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers from 1 to n. It finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements (1 and n) in the list. Then, it calculates the distances from these positions to both ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1) to determine the maximum possible distance it can achieve after a swap.

Here’s the crucial part: 
- It calculates four distances:
  - Distance from the maximum value to the start (0)
  - Distance from the maximum value to the end (n-1)
  - Distance from the minimum value to the start (0)
  - Distance from the minimum value to the end (n-1)

Finally, it prints the maximum of these distances.

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **Already maximized distance**: If 1 is at position 0 and n is at position n-1, the distance is already maximized (n-1). The code does not need to perform any swaps, but it still tries to compute distances.
2. **Swapping redundant values**: The program doesn't account for what happens if swapping 1 and n doesn’t improve the situation (i.e., they are already at the ends).

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints describe that the function calculates the maximum distance from the positions of integers 1 and n to either end of the list. This matches with the logic in the code since it does check distances to both ends. However, it misses explicitly handling the distance calculation considering the swap requirement, specifically for cases where swapping doesn't lead to an improvement.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code and considering the problem description and the output hints:
- The calculation of maximum distance does not fully address the requirement of "performing exactly one swap" in terms of maximizing the distance.
- It calculates potential distances but does not ensure that the swap leads to an improved maximum distance. For example, if 1 and n are already at opposite ends, the distance calculation will unnecessarily compute while the maximum achievable distance is already there without needing a swap.

Hence, the program does not fulfill the problem description correctly in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
