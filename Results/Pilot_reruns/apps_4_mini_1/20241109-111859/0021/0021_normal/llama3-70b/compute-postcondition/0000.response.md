The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The state of the list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers that forms a permutation of the integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers that forms a permutation of the integers from 1 to n.**
