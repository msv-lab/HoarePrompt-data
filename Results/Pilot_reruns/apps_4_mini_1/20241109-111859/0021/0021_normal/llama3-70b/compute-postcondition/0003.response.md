The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers and `n` is guaranteed to be in the range of the list, `posn` will hold the index where the value `n` is located in `a`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `pos1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.**
