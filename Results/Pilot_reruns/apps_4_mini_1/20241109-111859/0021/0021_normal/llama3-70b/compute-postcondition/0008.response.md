Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that forms a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the integers 1 and `n` in the list and prints that value, adjusted by calculating both maximum and minimum distances between those indices and the ends of the list. **
