The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, and `1` is included in the list, `a.index(1)` will return the position of the first occurrence of `1` in the list. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.**
