The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. Given that `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a` and `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, the expression calculates the minimum distance between `1` and `n` in the list, adjusting for the indices.

Since `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` are known based on the initial state constraints, the calculation of `min_dist` will depend on the values of `pos1` and `posn`. The variables `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` are not altered by this line of code, so the output state will reflect their values and the newly calculated `min_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is assigned the value max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is assigned the value min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
