The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), representing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. 

The function does not return any value as there is no specified output in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, but it does not specify a return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (permutation of integers from 1 to `n`). The function does not return a value.**
