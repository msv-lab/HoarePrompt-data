To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables defined in the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`.
- `dist1` is `max_pos`.
- `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
- `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be defined elsewhere and holds an integer value representing some index in the list `a`.

Now, the code to be executed:
```
dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)
```

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The code calculates `dist4` as the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. This means `dist4` will hold a value that depends on the specific values of `n` and `min_pos`.
2. The previous values of `dist1`, `dist2`, and `min_pos` are not affected by this operation; they remain the same.
3. Therefore, `dist4` will be assigned a new value based on the calculation `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `min_pos` are not specified, we will represent `dist4` as an expression dependent on those values.

Output State:
**`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is defined; `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**.
