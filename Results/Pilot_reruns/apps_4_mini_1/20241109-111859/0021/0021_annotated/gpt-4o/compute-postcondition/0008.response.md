To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the state of the program based on the initial state.

1. **Variables**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`.
   - `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
   - `min_pos` is defined (but its value is unknown).
   - `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.

2. **Calculating Distances**:
   - `dist1` is directly equal to `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` depends on the value of `max_pos` and `n`.
   - `dist3` is not defined in the initial state; hence, we cannot evaluate it.
   - `dist4` depends on `min_pos`, which is also unknown.

3. **Max Distance Calculation**:
   - `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
   - Since `dist3` is undefined, we cannot compute `max_distance` accurately without knowing `dist3`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The known states are `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist4`, and the fact that `max_distance` is a maximum of these distances.
   - There is insufficient information to compute the exact value of `max_distance` due to the undefined `dist3` and the unknown value of `min_pos`.

Therefore, the output state reflects what we know about the variables:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is defined; `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`.**
