The code calculates the absolute distance from index 0 to `max_pos`, which is the index of `n` in the list `a`. The value of `max_pos` is known as it is provided in the initial state. The value of `dist1` will be the absolute value of `max_pos - 0`, which is simply `max_pos`.

Since `max_pos` can take any integer value depending on the position of `n` in the list `a`, the output state will reflect that `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`**
