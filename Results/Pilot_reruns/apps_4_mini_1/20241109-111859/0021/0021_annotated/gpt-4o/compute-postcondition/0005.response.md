The value of `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`. Since the exact values of `n` and `max_pos` are unknown but fall within the defined ranges, `dist2` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state reflects these conditions without assigning specific values to `dist2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos`**
