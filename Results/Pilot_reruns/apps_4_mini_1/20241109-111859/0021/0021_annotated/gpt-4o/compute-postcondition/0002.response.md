`min_pos` is assigned the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `n`, the value `1` will exist in the list exactly once at a specific position. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a`, which is a list containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `min_pos` will be the zero-based index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in `a`**
