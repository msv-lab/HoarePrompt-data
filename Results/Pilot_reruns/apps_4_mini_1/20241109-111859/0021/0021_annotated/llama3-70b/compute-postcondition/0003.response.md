`posn` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The variable `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input. The specific value of `posn` depends on the position of `n` within the list `a`, which is not explicitly provided. Therefore, the output state indicates that `posn` will hold the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.**
