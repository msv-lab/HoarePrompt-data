The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The value of `n` indicates that the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and since `1` is one of those integers, `a.index(1)` will return the position of `1` in the list `a`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`.**
