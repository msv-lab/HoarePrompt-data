Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the function prints max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist).**
