Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates the maximum distance using the current positions of the minimum and maximum elements without considering that a swap is necessary to maximize that distance.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 5
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
In this case, the minimum element (1) is at index 0 and the maximum element (5) is at index 4. The current distance is 4, but the program does not perform any swap to potentially increase this distance since they are already at the ends. 

If we consider another case:
```
n = 5
a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]
```
Here, the minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (5) is at index 1. The program calculates distances to the ends but does not effectively consider that swapping 1 with 4 (index 4) would yield a maximum distance of 4 (1 at index 4 and 5 at index 1), which is greater than the calculated maximum distance of 1.

The program fails to account for the necessary swap to achieve the maximum distance, hence it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
