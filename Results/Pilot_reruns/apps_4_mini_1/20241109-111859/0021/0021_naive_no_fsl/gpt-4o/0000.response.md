To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and check if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The program should determine the maximum possible distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers.
2. **Finding Positions**: It finds the positions of the minimum (`1`) and maximum (`n`) elements in the list using `index()`.
3. **Calculating Distances**: It calculates the distance to the ends of the array (position 0 and position n-1) for both min and max:
   - `dist1`: Distance from the start (0) to the maximum position.
   - `dist2`: Distance from the end (n-1) to the maximum position.
   - `dist3`: Distance from the start (0) to the minimum position.
   - `dist4`: Distance from the end (n-1) to the minimum position.
4. **Max Distance Calculation**: The program then calculates the maximum distance from these four calculated distances and prints it.

### Edge Case Consideration
The program does not consider whether the swap that is performed actually maximizes the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. It simply calculates the maximum of the distances to the edges, which does not necessarily reflect a valid swap.

### Example Analysis
Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example**: 
   - Input: `5`, `4 5 1 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program correctly calculates the distance.

2. **Example**:
   - Input: `7`, `1 6 5 3 4 7 2`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - The program correctly calculates the distance.

3. **Example**:
   - Input: `6`, `6 5 4 3 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - The program correctly calculates the distance, even though no swap would change the maximum distance.

### Issue Identification
However, consider the following case:
- Input: `4`, `1 2 3 4`
- The minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (4) is at index 3. The maximum distance is already 3. If we swap 1 with 4, the max distance between 1 and 4 will become 3, which is the same as before. 

Now consider this case:
- Input: `4`, `4 3 2 1`
- The minimum (1) is at index 3 and the maximum (4) is at index 0. The maximum distance is already 3 (from index 0 to index 3). If we swap 4 with 1, it will result in the same distance of 3.

The program fails to correctly handle the logic of actually performing a swap to check if it achieves a maximum distance, instead only considering edge cases.

### Conclusion
Since we found a case where the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description, the output is:

Correctness: **False**
