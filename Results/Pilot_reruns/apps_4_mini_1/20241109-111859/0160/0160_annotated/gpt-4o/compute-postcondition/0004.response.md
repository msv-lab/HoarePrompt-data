Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes `i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, and also includes `x // i`. Since `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, the `divisors` will at least contain the value 1 and `x` itself if `x` is divisible by `i`.***
