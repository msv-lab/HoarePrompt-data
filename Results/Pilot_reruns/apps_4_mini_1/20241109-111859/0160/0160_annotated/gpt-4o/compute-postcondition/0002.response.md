The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. Since `i` is initialized to 1, the set `divisors` will now contain the integer 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `divisors` set along with the previous state of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is {1}, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
