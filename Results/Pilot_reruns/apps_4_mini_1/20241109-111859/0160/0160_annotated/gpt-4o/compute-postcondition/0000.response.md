The line of code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables, `N`, `K`, and `A`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set.**
