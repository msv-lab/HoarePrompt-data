Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)), and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` is updated to include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is a perfect square, `divisors` will include `i` only once. If `x` is less than 1 or greater than 10^6, the behavior regarding divisors remains unchanged.***
