According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `gcd` is at least 9. The maximum value of `i` for the next iteration can be determined as follows:

1. Compute `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is at least 9, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 3. Therefore, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Since `i` is currently 3 (the last value it held) and the loop condition requires `i` to be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, `i` should be adjusted to 4 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 4, `max_divisor` is updated accordingly**
