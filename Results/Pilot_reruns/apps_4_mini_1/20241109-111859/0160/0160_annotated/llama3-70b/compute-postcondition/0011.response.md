Output State: **`gcd` is the gcd of all elements in `A`, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers; if `N` is 2 or greater, the loop executes `N-1` times; `i` will be `N-1` after the loop; `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`.**
