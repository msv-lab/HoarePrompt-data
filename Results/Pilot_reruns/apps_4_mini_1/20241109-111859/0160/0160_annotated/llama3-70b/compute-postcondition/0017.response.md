According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `gcd` is at least 1. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `i`.

Since `i` is incremented in each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2. Additionally, we should also consider the condition for `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, which is the upper limit for `i`. Given that `gcd` is at least 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1 as well. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` after the increment.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to 2, and since `gcd` has not changed, it will remain the same. The value of `max_divisor` is not directly affected by the loop iteration itself, as it is only updated within the loop body based on the conditions. Therefore, it remains unchanged.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `max_divisor` is at least 1**
