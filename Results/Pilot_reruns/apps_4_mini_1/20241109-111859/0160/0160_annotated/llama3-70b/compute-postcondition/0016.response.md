Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is at least 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Thus, the postcondition ensures that `max_divisor` reflects the largest divisor found so far, considering both `i` and `gcd // i` when applicable.***
