According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (the starting value of the loop) and since the loop iterates until `N`, we need to determine if `i` is still less than `N` to execute the loop again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. The condition for the loop to continue depends on `N` being greater than 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as we only need to ensure that `i` is less than `N`.

State: **`gcd` is updated to the gcd of previous `gcd` and `A[3]`, `i` is 2, `N` is greater than 2**
