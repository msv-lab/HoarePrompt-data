The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is at least 1 and `i` is 1, the expression `gcd // i` evaluates to `gcd`. Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd`. The previous values of `max_divisor` and `gcd` do not change because `max_divisor` is assigned a new value based on the maximum calculation.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is updated to max(max_divisor, gcd)**
