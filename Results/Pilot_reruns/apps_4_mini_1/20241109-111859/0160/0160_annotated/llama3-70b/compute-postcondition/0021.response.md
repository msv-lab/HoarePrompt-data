Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
