The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq N \leq 500 \). 
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq K \leq 10^9 \). 
- `A` is a list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6 \).

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the task description, so we will summarize its functionality based on the parameters provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 500), a non-negative integer K (0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9), and a list A of N integers (1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^6).**
