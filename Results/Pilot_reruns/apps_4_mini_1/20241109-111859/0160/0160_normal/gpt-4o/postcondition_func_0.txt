The function accepts a list of integers `lst` with at least two elements and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list. If the list has fewer than two elements, it defaults to returning the first element as the gcd, but such cases are not explicitly handled in the code. Therefore, the function is expected to return the gcd of the list elements under normal conditions, but it may not correctly handle input with less than two elements.
