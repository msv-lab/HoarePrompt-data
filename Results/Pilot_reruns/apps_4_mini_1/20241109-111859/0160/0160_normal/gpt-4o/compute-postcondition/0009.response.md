According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` for the loop to execute one more time. Hence, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

Since the variable `x` is implied to remain the same, there are no changes needed for `N`, `K`, or `A`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
