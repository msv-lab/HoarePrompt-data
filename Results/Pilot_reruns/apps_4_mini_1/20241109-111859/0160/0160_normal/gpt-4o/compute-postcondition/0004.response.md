Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and potentially `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, where `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, and `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` will include both 1 and `x` since `x // i` equals `x` when `i` is 1. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged as an empty set.***
