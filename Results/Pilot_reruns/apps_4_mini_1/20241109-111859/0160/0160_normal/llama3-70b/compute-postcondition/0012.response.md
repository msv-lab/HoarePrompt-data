According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a non-negative integer, and specifically, it must be greater than or equal to 1 since the loop starts from 1. The loop iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which means that if `gcd` is 0, the loop will not execute because the range would be from 1 to 1 (exclusive). 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that `gcd` is at least 1. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 1, as that is the starting point of the loop iteration.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1**
