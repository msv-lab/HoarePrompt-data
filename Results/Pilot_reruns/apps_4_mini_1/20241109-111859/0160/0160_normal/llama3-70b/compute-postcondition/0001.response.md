The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input integers to integers, where the input is expected to consist of `N` integers. The initial values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this operation, but `A` is now defined as a list containing `N` integers that are provided via input. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `N`, `K`, and the newly assigned list `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers from input**
