The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` and `i` is 1, the comparison is between `gcd` (which is greater than or equal to 1) and 1. Therefore, `max_divisor` will remain the same if it is greater than `gcd`, or it will be updated to `gcd` if `gcd` is greater than 1. The variable `i` is not affected, so the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or remains the same, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or remains the same, `i` is 1**
