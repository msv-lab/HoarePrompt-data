According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `gcd`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

To determine the state of `i` at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect its new value, which will be the current value of `i` plus 1. Since the loop iterates until `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we also need to ensure that `gcd` is still sufficient to allow one more iteration. 

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to be `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` and make sure `gcd` is still appropriate for another iteration. 

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` or retains its previous value, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `gcd` is still sufficient to allow `i` to be incremented.**
