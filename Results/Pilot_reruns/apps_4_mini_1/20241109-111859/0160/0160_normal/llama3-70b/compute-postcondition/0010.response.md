Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers. If `N` is 2 or greater, the loop executes `N-1` times to compute the `gcd` of the list. If `N` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains as `A[0]`.**
