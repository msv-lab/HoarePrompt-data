Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation when the number of upvotes and downvotes can be equal, but the unknown votes create uncertainty in the result.

For example, consider the input `0 0 1`. According to the problem description, if there is one unknown voter, the result could either be a "+" (if the unknown votes up) or a "-" (if the unknown votes down). Therefore, the expected output should be `"?"` indicating uncertainty.

However, the program checks:

```python
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

With `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, we have:
- `min_upvotes = 0`
- `max_upvotes = 1`
- `min_downvotes = 0`
- `max_downvotes = 1`

In this case, neither `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` nor `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` is true, so it will go to the `else` statement and print `"?"`. However, the program does not cover the case where the total sums equal out, leading to uncertainty properly in all scenarios.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case.
