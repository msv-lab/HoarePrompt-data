The provided program aims to determine the voting outcome based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs and then determines the result based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.

Let's break down the logic in the code:

1. **Minimum and Maximum Votes Calculation**:
   - `min_upvotes = x`
   - `max_upvotes = x + z`
   - `min_downvotes = y`
   - `max_downvotes = y + z`
   
   This part of the code correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the inputs.

2. **Result Determination**:
   - The program checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, which would mean that downvotes outnumber upvotes, resulting in '-'.
   - It also checks if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, which would mean that upvotes outnumber downvotes, resulting in '+'.
   - If neither condition holds, it prints '?', indicating uncertainty in the result.

Now, let's analyze the edge cases:

- **Case when z = 0**: The code correctly handles this case, as it would effectively only compare x and y without any uncertainty.
- **Case when both x and y are zero**: If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z > 0`, the result should be uncertain ('?'), which the code correctly handles.
- **Boundary values**: The code should also correctly handle the upper limits of the input variables, ensuring that all comparisons are valid for the maximum values of 100.

Now, let's check the output hints against the code:

- The output hints accurately describe the logic of the code and confirm that it checks the conditions for determining the result. They mention the conditions for returning '-', '+', and '?', and these align with the logic written in the code.

Given that the code correctly implements the logic as per the problem description and the output hints are consistent with the code, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code meets all requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case discussed.
