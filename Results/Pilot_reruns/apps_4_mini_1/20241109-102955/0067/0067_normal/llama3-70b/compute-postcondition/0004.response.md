The code `print('?')` outputs the string `'?'` to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from `input`, such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and the output is '?'.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from `input`, such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and the output is '?'**
