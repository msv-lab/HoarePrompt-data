The `print('+')` statement outputs a plus sign to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from `input`, such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and a plus sign is printed**
