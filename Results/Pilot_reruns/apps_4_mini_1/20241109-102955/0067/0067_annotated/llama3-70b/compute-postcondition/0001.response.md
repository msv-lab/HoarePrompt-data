The code executes a `print('+')` statement, which outputs the character `+`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the input integers, where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and the output is '+'**
