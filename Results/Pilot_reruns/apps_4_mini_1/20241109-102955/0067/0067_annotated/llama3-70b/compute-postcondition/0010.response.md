The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). The function's output is determined by specific conditions related to these integers. 

Since the output specification is not provided, we will assume that the function's behavior is based on the relationships between `x`, `y`, and `z`, and it may return results based on these conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers x, y, and z, which must be in the range of 0 to 100. The specific output behavior depends on the conditions related to these integers, which are not specified.**
