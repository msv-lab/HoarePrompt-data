The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value `x + z`. The previous values of `x` and `z` are provided as input integers, where `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. Since `min_upvotes` is also equal to `x`, it does not affect the calculation for `max_upvotes`. Thus, `max_upvotes` is determined by the sum of `x` and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is `x`; `max_upvotes` is `x + z`**.
