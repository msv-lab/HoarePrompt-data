The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignment of `min_upvotes` but keep `x`, `y`, and `z` as they are.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is `x`**
