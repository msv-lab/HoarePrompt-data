Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, which must be in the range of 0 to 100. It calculates minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes based on these integers. It prints '-' if the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' in all other cases, including when both conditions are not satisfied. This function does not return any values; it only prints the results based on the comparisons. **
