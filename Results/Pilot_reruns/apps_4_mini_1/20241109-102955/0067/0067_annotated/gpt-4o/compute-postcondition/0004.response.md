The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. Since `y` and `z` are both input integers, their specific values are not known, but the equation suggests that `max_downvotes` will be a sum of those two input integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
