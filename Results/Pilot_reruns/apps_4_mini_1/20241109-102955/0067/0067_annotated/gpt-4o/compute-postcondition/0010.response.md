The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that the function operates on three integer variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). The output behavior of the function is not specified, so we cannot ascertain how it processes these parameters or what it returns based on them.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on three integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100. The specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
