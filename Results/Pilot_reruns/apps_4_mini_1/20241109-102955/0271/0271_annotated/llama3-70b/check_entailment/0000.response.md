Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. 

Specifically, the issue arises with how the program rounds numbers that fall exactly halfway between two multiples of ten. According to the problem description, if `n` is 5 or any number that ends with 5, Vasya can round it to either 0 or 10. However, the code only rounds 5 to 10 (by following the logic in the else block). This is a specific case where the program does not align with the problem description, which states that both 0 and 10 are acceptable outputs.

For example:
- If `n = 5`, the output will be 10.
- However, according to the problem description, an output of 0 should also be valid.

The annotations state that "If `n` modulo 10 is greater than 5, the function prints the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`." This directly contradicts the problem's allowance for 0 as a valid output when `n` is 5, indicating that the code does not fulfill the requirements for all potential cases.

Thus, since there is at least one input (in this case, when `n = 5`) that the program does not handle correctly, the overall correctness is deemed false.
