Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` modulo 10 is less than or equal to 5, the value printed is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n` (i.e., `n - n % 10`). If `n` modulo 10 is greater than 5, the value printed is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` (i.e., `n + (10 - n % 10)`). This ensures that the output is always a multiple of 10 within the specified range.***
