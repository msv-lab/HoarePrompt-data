The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is an input non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and the value of `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. Therefore, the expression `(10 - remainder)` will yield a value between 1 and 10, depending on the value of `remainder`. The specific value of `result` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `n` and `remainder`, but it will always be greater than or equal to `n + 1` and less than or equal to `n + 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
