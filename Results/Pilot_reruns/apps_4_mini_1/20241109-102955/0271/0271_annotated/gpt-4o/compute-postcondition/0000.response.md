The code assigns the value of `n` to be `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input that is non-negative and within the range of 0 to 10^9. The initial state of `n` is overwritten by the value provided by the user through input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is now equal to the input value. 

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
