The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9. The state of the variable `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`**
