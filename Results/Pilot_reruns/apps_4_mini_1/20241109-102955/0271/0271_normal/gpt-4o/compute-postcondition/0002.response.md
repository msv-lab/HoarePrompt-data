The code assigns the value of `result` to `n - remainder`, where `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`. Since `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, the operation effectively removes that last digit from `n` when calculating `result`. 

Given that `n` is an input non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), we can express `result` as `n - (n % 10)`. 

The output state will reflect that `result` is now equal to `n` without its last digit, while `n` and `remainder` maintain their respective values.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`; `result` is `n - remainder`**
