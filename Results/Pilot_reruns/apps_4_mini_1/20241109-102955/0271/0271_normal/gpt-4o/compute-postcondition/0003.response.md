The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which gives the last digit of `n`. The variable `result` is then assigned the value `n + (10 - remainder)`. This effectively rounds `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, the possible values for `remainder` range from `0` to `9`. Therefore, `result` will be calculated as follows:

- If `remainder` is `0`, then `result = n + (10 - 0) = n + 10`.
- If `remainder` is `1`, then `result = n + (10 - 1) = n + 9`.
- If `remainder` is `2`, then `result = n + (10 - 2) = n + 8`.
- If `remainder` is `3`, then `result = n + (10 - 3) = n + 7`.
- If `remainder` is `4`, then `result = n + (10 - 4) = n + 6`.
- If `remainder` is `5`, then `result = n + (10 - 5) = n + 5`.
- If `remainder` is `6`, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
- If `remainder` is `7`, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
- If `remainder` is `8`, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
- If `remainder` is `9`, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `n` remains unchanged and `result` is either `n + 1`, `n + 2`, ..., or `n + 10`, depending on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer; `remainder` is `n % 10`; `result` is either `n + 1`, `n + 2`, ..., or `n + 10`**.
