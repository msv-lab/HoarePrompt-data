Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n`. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`, which is `n - n % 10`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the function prints the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`, which is `n + (10 - n % 10`. This handles all cases for rounding `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.***
