The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the result of the print statement will display this calculated value. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and the output printed is `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and the output printed is `n - n % 10`**
