Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
