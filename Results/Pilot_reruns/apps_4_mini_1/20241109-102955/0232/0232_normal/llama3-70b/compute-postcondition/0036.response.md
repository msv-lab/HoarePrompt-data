Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `window_counts` does not match the targets, `found` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is set to `colors[j]`, while `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1.***
