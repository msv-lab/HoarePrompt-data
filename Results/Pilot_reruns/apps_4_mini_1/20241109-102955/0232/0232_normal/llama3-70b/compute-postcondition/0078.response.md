Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, if `found` is False, `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, and `i` is unchanged. If `n` is 0 or if `i` is not less than `n`, the loop does not execute and the values of `found`, `window_counts`, and `i` are unaffected. If `colors` has fewer elements than `n`, the loop runs only for the available elements, and `found` may remain False if no match is found.***
