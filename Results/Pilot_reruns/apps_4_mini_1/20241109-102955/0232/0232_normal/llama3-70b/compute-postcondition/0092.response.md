Postcondition: ***`found` is True if the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
