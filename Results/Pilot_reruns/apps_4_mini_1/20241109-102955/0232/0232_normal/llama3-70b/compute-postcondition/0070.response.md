Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts` is updated such that if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is now set to 0. The variable `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `j` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, there is no change to `window_counts`.***
