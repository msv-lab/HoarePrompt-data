Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `j` is `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the respective target counts from `counts`, then `found` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, the state of `found`, `j`, `i`, and `n` remains unchanged, with `window_counts[color]` incremented by 1 prior to this check.***
