Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`. The variables `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
