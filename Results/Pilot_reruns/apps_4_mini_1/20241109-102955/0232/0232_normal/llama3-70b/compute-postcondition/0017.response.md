The loop processes each element in the `colors` list to count occurrences of each unique color and stores these counts in the `color_counts` dictionary. 

If `colors` is a list with at least one integer, the loop will execute for each integer in the list. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `color_counts` will remain an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` will contain counts of each unique color from the `colors` list, where each key is a color and the value is the number of times that color appears. If `colors` is empty, then `color_counts` remains empty.**
