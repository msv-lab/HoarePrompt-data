Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `n` and `found` is True, the loop execution will terminate, leaving `found`, `window_counts`, and `i` unchanged, while `j` will not be defined. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `window_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is not defined. If no match is found after all iterations, `found` will still be False.***
