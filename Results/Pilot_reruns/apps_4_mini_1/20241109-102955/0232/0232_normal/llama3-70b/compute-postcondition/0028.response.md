Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. The variables `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0 remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, while `color_counts`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]` also remain unchanged.***
