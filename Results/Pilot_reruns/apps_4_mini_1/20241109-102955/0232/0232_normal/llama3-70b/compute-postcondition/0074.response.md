Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `j` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `found`, and the loop continues.***
