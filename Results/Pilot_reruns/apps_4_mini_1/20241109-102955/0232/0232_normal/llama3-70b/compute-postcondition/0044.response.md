Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the state of `found` remains unchanged and the loop continues without any modification to `color_counts` or the other variables.***
