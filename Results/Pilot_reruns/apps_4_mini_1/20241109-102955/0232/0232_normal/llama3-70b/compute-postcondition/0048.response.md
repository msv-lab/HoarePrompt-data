Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks, leaving `color_counts` unchanged, `found` as False, `i` as 0, `n` as 0, and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. If `n` is 0 or `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, resulting in the same final state where `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.***
