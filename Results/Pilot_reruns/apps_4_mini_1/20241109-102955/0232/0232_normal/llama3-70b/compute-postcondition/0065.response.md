The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
