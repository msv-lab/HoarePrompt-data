According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`, which means `j` will start from `i` and go up to `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 1 and `i` is unchanged, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to start executing.

1. We know that `n` is at least 1.
2. We need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute (i.e., `i < n`).
3. At the start of the loop, `j` will take the value of `i`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `i` must be less than `n`, and we can set `j` to `i` at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`found` is False, `window_counts` is {}, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`**
