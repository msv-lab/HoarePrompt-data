Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains `color` as a key with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`, while `j` remains 0 and `color` is assigned from the first element of `colors`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
