Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `color` is the first element of the `colors` list. If `color` is not already a key in the `color_counts` dictionary, it is added with a value of 0, resulting in `color_counts` containing the entry {`color`: 0}. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary.***
