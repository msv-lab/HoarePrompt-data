Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, `color` is the first element of the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `color_counts` having the entry {`color`: 1} if `color` was initially 0 or {`color`: previous value + 1} if `color` was already present.**
