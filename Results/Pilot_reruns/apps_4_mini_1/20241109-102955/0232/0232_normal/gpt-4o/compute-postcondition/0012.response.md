Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is equal to `desired_counts[colors[right]]`. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts in `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If not, the function does not return anything.***
