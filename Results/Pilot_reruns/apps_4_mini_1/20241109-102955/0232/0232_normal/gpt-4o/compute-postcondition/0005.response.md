The function returns `'YES'`, and the values of `n` and `right` remain unchanged. The `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been increased by 1, but this does not affect the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and the function returns 'YES'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and the function returns 'YES'**
