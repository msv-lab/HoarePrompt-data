The line of code `current_counts[colors[right]] += 1` increments the value at the index `colors[right]` in the `current_counts` array by 1. Given that `right` is less than `n`, `colors[right]` is a valid index for the `colors` array. The previous value at `current_counts[colors[right]]` is not specified, but it will increase by 1 after execution. The states of the other variables, `left`, `right`, and any other variables, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is greater than or equal to `right + 1`, `right` is less than n, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
