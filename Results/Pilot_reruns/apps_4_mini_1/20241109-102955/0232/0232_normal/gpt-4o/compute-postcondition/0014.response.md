Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts in `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function returns 'YES' and `left` has been incremented to a value greater than or equal to `right`. If the loop does not start (i.e., if any color in `current_counts` is less than its corresponding value in `desired_counts`), then `current_counts` remains unchanged, `left` remains at its initial value, and the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).**
