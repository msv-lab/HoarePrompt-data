The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 4, `color` is assigned colors[4], and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
