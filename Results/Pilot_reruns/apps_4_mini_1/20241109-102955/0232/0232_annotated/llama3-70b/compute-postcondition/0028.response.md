Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`, `found` is set to True, `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` includes `color` with a value of 1, and `j` remains 0 if `all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))` evaluates to True. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and all other variables retain their initial values.***
