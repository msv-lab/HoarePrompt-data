Postcondition: ***`found` is True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
