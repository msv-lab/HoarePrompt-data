Postcondition: ***`found` is True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `{color: 0}`. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
