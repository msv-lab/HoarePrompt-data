Postcondition: ***`found` is False before the execution, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False and the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
