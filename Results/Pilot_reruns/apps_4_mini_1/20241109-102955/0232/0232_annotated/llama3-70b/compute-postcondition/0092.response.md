Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
