Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 4, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[4]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
