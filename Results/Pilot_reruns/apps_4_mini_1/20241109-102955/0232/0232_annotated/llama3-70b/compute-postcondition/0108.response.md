Postcondition: ***`found` will be True if there exists a subarray of `colors` from index `i` to `n-1` where the counts of colors match the corresponding values in `counts`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `found` remains False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `found` is True, the loop is exited.***
