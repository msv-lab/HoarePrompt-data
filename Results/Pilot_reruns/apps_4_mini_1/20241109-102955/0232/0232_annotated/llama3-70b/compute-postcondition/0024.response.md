Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary {} before execution. If `color` is not found in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a value of 0; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged and empty. `j` is still 0.***
