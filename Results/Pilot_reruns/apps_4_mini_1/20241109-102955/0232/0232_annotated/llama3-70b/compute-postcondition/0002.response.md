The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The `input()` function accepts a space-separated string of integers, which is then split into individual string components and converted to integers. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `colors` remains unchanged, but `counts` will now contain a list of integers based on the input. The output state will reflect the unchanged initial values of `n`, `m`, and `colors`, along with the new `counts` list, which will contain integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, and `counts` is a list of integers based on input.**
