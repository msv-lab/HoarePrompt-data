Postcondition: ***`color` is `colors[1]`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` remains True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains True, and the program continues executing the outer loop without breaking.***
