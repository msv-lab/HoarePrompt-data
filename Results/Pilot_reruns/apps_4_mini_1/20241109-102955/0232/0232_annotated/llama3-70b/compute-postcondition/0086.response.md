The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
