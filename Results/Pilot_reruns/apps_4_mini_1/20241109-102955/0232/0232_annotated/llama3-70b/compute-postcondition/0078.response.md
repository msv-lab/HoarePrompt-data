Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks, leaving `i` unchanged at 1, `n` greater than 1, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `found` is False, the state remains unchanged with `found`, `i`, `n`, and `window_counts` retaining their initial values, where `n` is greater than 1 and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.***
