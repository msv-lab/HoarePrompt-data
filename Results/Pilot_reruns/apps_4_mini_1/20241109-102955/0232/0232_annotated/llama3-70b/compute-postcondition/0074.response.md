Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, the values of `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, and `window_counts[color]` remain unchanged.***
