The statement `current_counts[colors[right]] += 1` updates the count for the color at the index specified by `right`. Since `right` is 1, we are looking at the second element of the `colors` list (assuming 0-based indexing). The value of `colors[right]` is evaluated, and the corresponding index in `current_counts` is incremented by 1. The values of `left`, `n`, and `current_counts` will remain unchanged aside from the update to `current_counts`.

Since the exact values of `colors` and `current_counts` are not provided, we can only describe the general effect:

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated for `colors[1]`, `left` is less than n, `right` is 1**
