According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 0 and `left` is less than `n`. Since the loop is iterating over the range of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented. This means that `right` should be adjusted to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `current_counts` and `left` remain unaffected by the increment of `right`.

State: **`current_counts` is updated for `colors[1]`, `left` is less than n, `right` is 1**
