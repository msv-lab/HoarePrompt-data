Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`, at least one `current_counts[color]` is now less than `desired_counts[color]` for some color in `desired_counts`, and the function returns 'YES'.**
