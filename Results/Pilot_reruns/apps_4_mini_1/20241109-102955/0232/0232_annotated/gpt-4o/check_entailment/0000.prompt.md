You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
Annotated Program:

def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k.
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, and `current_counts` is a defaultdict of int initialized to 0 for all keys.
    left = 0
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict of int initialized to 0 for all keys, and `left` is 0
    for right in range(n):
        current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
        
        while all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in
            desired_counts):
            if all(current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in
                desired_counts):
                return 'YES'
            current_counts[colors[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `current_counts` contains the count of each color seen up to index `right`, `left` is the index from which the window of colors starts, and `right` is the index of the last color processed. If `current_counts` never meets the `desired_counts`, `left` remains 0 and the loop does not execute, meaning no return occurs. If `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` at any point, the function returns 'YES'. If `n` is 0 or if `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, `left` remains 0, and the function does not return anything.
    return 'NO'
    #State of the program after the return statement: `current_counts` contains the count of each color seen up to index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` reflects the last processed index, and the function returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of integers `colors` of length `n`, and a list of integers `k` of length `m`. It checks if any contiguous subarray of `colors` can have a count of colors that matches the desired counts specified in `k`. If such a subarray exists, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. If `n` is 0 or if `colors` is empty, the function will not execute the main logic, but it will return 'NO' since it reaches the end of the function without finding a match.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
