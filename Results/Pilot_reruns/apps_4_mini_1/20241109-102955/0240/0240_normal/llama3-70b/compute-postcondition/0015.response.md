The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, which may include leading zeros. After executing the function body, it processes the string `s` to create a new string `n`, which consists of characters from `s` that are also found in a set derived from `t`, combined with `t` itself. The function then converts `n` to an integer and returns that integer value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty substring `t` of digits, and it returns an integer formed by combining characters from `s` that are also in `t` along with `t` itself.**
