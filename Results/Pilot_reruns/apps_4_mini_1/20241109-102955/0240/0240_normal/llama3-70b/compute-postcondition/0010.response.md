Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the third character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the value of `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, the value of `n` remains unchanged.***
