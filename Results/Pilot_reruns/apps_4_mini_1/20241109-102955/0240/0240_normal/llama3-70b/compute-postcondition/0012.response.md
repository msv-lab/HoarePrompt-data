Output State: **`n` is a string that contains all the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains digits that are not in `t_set`, those characters are ignored, and `n` remains unchanged for those characters while it is updated for those that match.**
