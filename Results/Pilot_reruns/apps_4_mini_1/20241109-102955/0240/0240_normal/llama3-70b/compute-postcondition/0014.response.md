The function returns `int(n)`, where `n` is a string that contains all the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, and `t` has been appended to it. The final value of `n` is converted to an integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we assume it is a string representation of a number. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current state of `n` as a string, and the function will return the integer representation of that string.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing characters from `s` that are also in `t_set` plus `t`, and the function returns `int(n)`**
