The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub` of `s`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`. It then generates all possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the smallest number among them. If there are no valid numbers that can be formed, the behavior is undefined since the function does not handle this case explicitly. Additionally, if `generate_possible_numbers` does not return any valid numbers, the function may raise an exception when trying to find the minimum.
