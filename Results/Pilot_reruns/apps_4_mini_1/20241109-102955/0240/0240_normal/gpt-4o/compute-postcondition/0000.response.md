According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `chars` is not empty because the `permutations` function requires a non-empty iterable to generate permutations. Since `sub` is a non-empty substring of `n`, there are no additional constraints on `chars` itself being non-empty, as `chars` must include the digits represented by `n`.

For the loop to be executed, `chars` must have at least one character to generate permutations, and `perm` will represent each permutation of `chars`. At the beginning of the first iteration, `perm` can be considered the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the first permutation of chars**
