According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of `chars`. The variable `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and since it has been yielded as `candidate` if it was valid, it means there are still remaining permutations to consider.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, there are several permutations possible. The loop will continue until all permutations are exhausted. To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider that `perm` should be the next permutation in the sequence of all permutations generated from `chars`.

Since the last `perm` yielded a `candidate`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `perm` could now potentially be the next permutation after the current one that has just been processed.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is formed by joining the next `perm`.**
