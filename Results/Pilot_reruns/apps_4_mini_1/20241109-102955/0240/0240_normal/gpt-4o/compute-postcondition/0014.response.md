The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string that represents the shuffled digits of a number `n` and `k`, with a length that does not exceed 1,000,000. The parameter `sub` is a non-empty string that represents a substring of `n`, which may contain leading zeroes. 

The function generates possible numbers based on the provided `chars` and the substring `sub`. The specific output of the function is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function would return a collection or a set of valid number combinations that can be formed given the constraints of the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `chars` representing shuffled digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It generates and returns possible numbers based on these inputs.**
