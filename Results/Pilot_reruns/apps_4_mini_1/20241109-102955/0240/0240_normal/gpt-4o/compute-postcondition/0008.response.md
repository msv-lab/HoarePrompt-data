According to the code, the next iteration of the loop will depend on the `chars` string and the permutations generated from it. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` at the end of the last iteration, we need to determine what the next state should be for another iteration to occur.

The `permutations(chars)` function will generate all possible permutations of the `chars` string. If `perm` is the last permutation, then there will be no valid next permutation unless `chars` has been modified or reset. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `perm` has a valid next permutation available.

Assuming that `chars` has not been changed, we would need to adjust `perm` to reflect the next permutation in the sequence, and this would also entail adjusting the `candidate` to be formed from this new `perm`.

However, based on the context, we are not given an explicit way to determine the next permutation, but we can say that `perm` should be the next permutation after the current one we have.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is formed by joining the next `perm`.**
