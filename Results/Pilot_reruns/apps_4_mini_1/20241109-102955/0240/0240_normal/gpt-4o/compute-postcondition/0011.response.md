Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is formed by joining the next `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, nothing is yielded and the function completes without yielding any output.***
