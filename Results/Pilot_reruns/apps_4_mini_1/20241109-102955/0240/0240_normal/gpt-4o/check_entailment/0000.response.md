To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the functions and their output hints in detail.

### Initial Assessment:

1. **Function `func_1(s, sub)`**:
   - This function calculates the length `n_len` of the original number `n` by subtracting the length of `sub` from the length of `s`.
   - It uses `Counter` to keep track of the characters in `s` and `sub`.
   - The remaining characters in `s` are calculated after removing the characters found in `sub`.
   - The function then generates all possible numbers from the remaining characters and returns the smallest number.

2. **Function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**:
   - This function checks if `sub` is present in a given number string and if the length of that number string matches `n_len`.
   - However, `n_len` is not defined within this function, which will lead to a `NameError` when called.

3. **Function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**:
   - This function generates permutations of the remaining characters and checks if they satisfy the conditions defined in `is_valid_number`.

### Edge Cases:
- The functionality of `is_valid_number` is incomplete because it relies on `n_len` which is not accessible in its scope. This will cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly when checking the length condition.
- If the permutation generation does not yield any valid numbers, there is no explicit handling for that case, which may lead to an exception or incorrect behavior when the program attempts to find the minimum of an empty list.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
- The output hints for `func_1` state that it can generate all possible numbers from the remaining characters and return the smallest. However, they highlight that if `generate_possible_numbers` does not return any valid numbers, the behavior is undefined. This indicates that there can be cases where the program fails to produce a valid output.
- The hints for `is_valid_number` indicate that it will raise a `NameError` due to the undefined `n_len`, reinforcing the idea that the function does not work correctly.

### Conclusion:
Due to the presence of the `NameError` in `is_valid_number` and the lack of handling for cases when no valid permutations are found, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it raises an error when trying to check the length condition in `is_valid_number`, and it does not handle the case where no valid permutations can be formed, which are both critical to fulfilling the problem's requirements.
