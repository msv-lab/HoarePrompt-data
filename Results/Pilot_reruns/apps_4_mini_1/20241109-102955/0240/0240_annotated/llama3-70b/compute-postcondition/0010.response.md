Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 3 characters, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is the current value of `n`, and `c` is the third character of `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the integer value of `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, the value of `n` remains unchanged.***
