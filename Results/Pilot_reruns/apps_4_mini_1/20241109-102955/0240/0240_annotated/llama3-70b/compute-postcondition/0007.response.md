Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is the current value of `n`, and `c` is the second character of `s`. If the second character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, the value of `n` remains unchanged.***
