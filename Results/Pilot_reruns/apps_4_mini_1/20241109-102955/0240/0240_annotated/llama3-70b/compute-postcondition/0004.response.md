Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to equal `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string.***
