To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's break down the requirements and analyze the code.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. The input consists of a string `s` which is a shuffled combination of a number `n` and the count of digits in `n`.
2. A non-empty substring `t` of `n` is also provided, and the goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n`.
3. The number `n` should not have leading zeroes, except for the case when `n` is `0`.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s, t)` does the following:
- Creates a set `t_set` from characters of `t`.
- Constructs a new string `n` by iterating through `s` and appending characters that are found in `t_set`.
- Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer representation of the resulting string.

### Code Annotations Review:
- The annotations clarify that `n` will consist of characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` and then concatenated with `t`.
- If `s` contains no characters from `t_set`, the function will return `t` as an integer, which is a valid case.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: If `s` is "000000" and `t` is "0", the function will return `0`, which is correct. However, if `t` were "01", the function would return `1`, which is correct since `n` cannot have leading zeros.
2. **All Characters in `t` Present in `s`**: If `s` contains all characters of `t` plus extra characters, the function will still correctly concatenate and return a valid integer.
3. **No Characters from `t` in `s`**: The function will return `int(t)`, which is valid according to the description.

### Edge Cases Not Handled:
However, the following case showcases a flaw:
- If `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the function would generate "30021" which is correct. But if `s` were "000" and `t` were "01", it would generate "001", which should not be valid because `n` cannot have leading zeros.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all edge cases related to leading zeros, particularly if `t` contains digits that would lead to an invalid representation of `n`. 

Thus, there is at least one case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
