You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, `s_counter` is a Counter object representing the character frequencies in `s`
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    #State of the program here: `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, `s_counter` is a Counter object representing the character frequencies in `s`, and `sub_counter` is a Counter object representing the character frequencies in `sub`
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s_counter` has been updated by decrementing the count of each character in `sub_counter` based on its frequency in `sub`. If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `s_counter` remains unchanged. If `sub_counter` contains characters not present in `s_counter`, those characters will not affect the counts in `s_counter`, and any characters in `s_counter` that are decremented could potentially become negative if `sub` has a higher frequency of some characters than present in `s`. `n_len` remains the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, and if `sub` is longer than `s`, `n_len` will be negative.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    #State of the program here: `s_counter` remains unchanged, `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, and `remaining_chars` is a string formed by joining each character in `s_counter` multiplied by its count.
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    #State of the program here: `s_counter` remains unchanged, `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, and the function `generate_possible_numbers` is called with `remaining_chars` and `sub` as arguments.
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    #State of the program here: `s_counter` remains unchanged, `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, and `smallest_number` is the minimum value of `possible_numbers` based on integer comparison.
    return smallest_number
    #State of the program after the return statement: `s_counter` remains unchanged, `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, and the function returns `smallest_number`
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the frequency of each character in both strings, updates the frequency of characters in `s` by removing the frequency of characters found in `sub`, and constructs a new string `remaining_chars` from the remaining characters. It then generates possible numbers from `remaining_chars` based on `sub` and returns the smallest possible number as a string. If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, the function may produce unexpected results or errors during character frequency calculations. Additionally, there is no handling for cases where no valid numbers can be generated, which could lead to a runtime error when calling the `min` function on an empty list.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #State of the program after the return statement: `num_str` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of the number `n`, and the function returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is in `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is present in `num_str` and whether the length of `num_str` matches a variable `n_len`. However, the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function, which could lead to a NameError if the function is executed. Therefore, the function's intended behavior is to validate the presence of `sub` in `num_str` and check its length against a potentially undefined `n_len`.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string of digits with length between 1 and 1,000,000, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of that permutation. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, it is yielded. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `sub` is not a valid number or contains only leading zeroes, this may affect the validity check but does not prevent the loop from executing; however, it may lead to no candidates being yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `chars` composed of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It generates and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the validity check performed by the `is_valid_number` function against `sub`. The function does not return a list of possible numbers; instead, it yields each valid candidate one at a time, which means that it can handle very large input sizes efficiently without generating a complete list in memory. If `chars` is empty, the function yields nothing. Additionally, if `sub` contains only leading zeroes or is not a valid number, this does not prevent the generation of permutations but may affect the yielded candidates' validity.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
