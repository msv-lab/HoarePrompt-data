According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character, since an empty string would result in no permutations to iterate over.

At the beginning of the loop, `perm` will represent the first permutation generated. As `chars` is a string of digits, if it has at least one character, then `perm` will be set to the first permutation of `chars`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
