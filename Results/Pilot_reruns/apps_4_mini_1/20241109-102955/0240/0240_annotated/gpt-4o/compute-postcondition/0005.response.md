The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all elements of `perm` into a single string. The value of `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, which is a string of digits. Therefore, `candidate` now holds the string representation of the second permutation of `chars`. The state of `chars` and `perm` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of the second permutation of `chars**.
