The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it concatenates all characters in the `perm` list (which is the first permutation of the string `chars`). Since `perm` is derived from `chars`, which is a string of digits with at least 1 character, the value of `candidate` will be a string representing the first permutation of `chars`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars` as a string.**
