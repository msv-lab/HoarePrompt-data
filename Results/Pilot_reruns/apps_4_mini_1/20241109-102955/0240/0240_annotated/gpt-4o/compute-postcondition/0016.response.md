Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the frequency of each character in both strings, updates the frequency of characters in `s` by removing the frequency of characters found in `sub`, and constructs a new string `remaining_chars` from the remaining characters. It then generates possible numbers from `remaining_chars` based on `sub` and returns the smallest possible number as a string. If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, the function may produce unexpected results or errors during character frequency calculations. Additionally, there is no handling for cases where no valid numbers can be generated, which could lead to a runtime error when calling the `min` function on an empty list.**
