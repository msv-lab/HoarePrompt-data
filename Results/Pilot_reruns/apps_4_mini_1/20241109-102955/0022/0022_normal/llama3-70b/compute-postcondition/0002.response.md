The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `s` and `n`, along with the new value of `is_spalindrome`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True**
