The variable `is_palindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, and `is_palindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, and `is_palindrome` is False**
