Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of English letters. It checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center. The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` if it is not. If `s` has a length of 1, it is always considered a palindrome, and the function will return `True`. The function does not handle cases for empty strings as per the provided constraints. **
