The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The initial states of the variables `s`, `n`, `is_palindrome`, and `i` are not impacted by this assignment. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
