According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n // 2`, and `n` is the length of the string `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the conditions for `n` must ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n // 2`. This means `n` must be greater than `2 * (i + 1)` to allow for another iteration.

Thus, to adjust the states accordingly, we have:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` must ensure that the loop can continue, which means it should be at least `2 * (i + 1)`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, `i` is updated to i + 1**
