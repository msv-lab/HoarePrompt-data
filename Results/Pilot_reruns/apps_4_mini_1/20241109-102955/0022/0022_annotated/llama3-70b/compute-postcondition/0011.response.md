According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the calculated value of `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1). Therefore, if `i` was updated to `i + 1` during the last iteration, then for the loop to run again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n // 2`.

Since `n` is greater than 2 * (i + 1), we can conclude that `n // 2` is also greater than `i + 1`. Thus, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`**
