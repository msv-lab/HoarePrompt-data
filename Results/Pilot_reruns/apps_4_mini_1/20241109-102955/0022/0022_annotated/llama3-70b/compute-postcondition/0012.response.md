The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `is_palindrome`, and `i`) remain unchanged, although `i` was previously updated to `i + 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables, including the new assignment.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
