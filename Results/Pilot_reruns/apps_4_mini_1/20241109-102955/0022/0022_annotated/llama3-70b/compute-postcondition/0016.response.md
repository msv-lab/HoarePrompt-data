Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it is False. The loop executes up to `n // 2` times, comparing characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1`. If at any point these characters are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2 or more, it checks up to half the length of the string.**
