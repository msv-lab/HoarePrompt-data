The function accepts a string `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 and checks if it is a palindrome. It returns True if the string is a palindrome and False if it is not. The function does not handle cases where the string is empty or contains non-English letters, but given the constraints, it assumes valid input. If the length of the string is 1, it automatically returns True as single-character strings are palindromes.
