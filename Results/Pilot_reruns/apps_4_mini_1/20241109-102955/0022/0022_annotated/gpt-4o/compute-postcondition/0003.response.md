Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters match, the function does not return anything, implying that further checks (if any) may continue, but the current check for this specific pair of characters is satisfied.***
