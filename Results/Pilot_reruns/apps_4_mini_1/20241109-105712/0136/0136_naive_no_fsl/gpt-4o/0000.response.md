Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle the case where both numbers are equal, but consist entirely of leading zeros. For example, if the input is:

```
0000
0000
```

The program will strip the leading zeros from both numbers, resulting in `a = ''` and `b = ''`, which the program subsequently treats as `a = '0'` and `b = '0'`. However, if the input were:

```
0000
0001
```

The program would correctly identify `0000` as less than `0001`, but when both inputs are `0000`, it will ultimately lead to an incorrect output since it does not handle the case of both being equal properly after stripping leading zeros. 

Thus, there exist inputs for which the program does not satisfy the requirements stated in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
