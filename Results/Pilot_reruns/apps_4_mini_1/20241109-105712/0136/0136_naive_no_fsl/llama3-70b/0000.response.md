Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case of comparing two numbers that are both "0" after stripping leading zeros. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are "000000", the program will strip the leading zeros and compare empty strings, which will lead to incorrect behavior when it comes to determining equality.

For example:
Input:
```
000000
000000
```
Expected Output:
```
=
```
Actual Behavior:
The program will compare `''` (empty string) with `''` (empty string) and return `=`, which is correct, but if the input were something like:
```
000000
0
```
It would strip the leading zeros and again compare `''` with `''`, leading to the same output, which is correct.

However, the program fails to consider other edge cases, such as:
Input:
```
000001
1
```
Expected Output:
```
=
```
But it will return `>` since `000001` becomes `1` after stripping leading zeros, and the comparison is done on equal strings.

Therefore, the program is not handling all cases correctly based on the problem description.
