Postcondition: ***`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if `a` is empty. `b` is '0' if initially empty, or retains its original string value without leading zeroes. The program prints '>' if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are compared as strings, and the `data` remains unchanged throughout. All edge cases regarding empty strings and leading zeroes have been addressed.***
