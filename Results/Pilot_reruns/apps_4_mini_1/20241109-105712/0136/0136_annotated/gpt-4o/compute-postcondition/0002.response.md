The code assigns the value of `b` to be `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The variable `a` remains unchanged, and its value is still `data[0]` without leading zeroes. Since `b` is a string and `data` is unchanged, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes; `data` is unchanged.**
