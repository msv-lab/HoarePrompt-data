The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The `data` variable will now hold a list of substrings derived from the input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes and each can have no more than 10^6 digits; `data` is a list of substrings derived from the input.**
