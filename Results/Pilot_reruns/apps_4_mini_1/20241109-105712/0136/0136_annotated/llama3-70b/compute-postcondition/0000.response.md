The value of `a` is assigned the value of `input()` after stripping leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, the resulting value of `a` will be the input string without any leading zeros or will be an empty string if the input was all zeros. The state of `b` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
