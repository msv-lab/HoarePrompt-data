Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer (which is '0' if initially empty), and `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros (which is '0' if initially empty). If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. This covers all cases, including scenarios where both `a` and `b` may be empty or consist of the value '0'.***
