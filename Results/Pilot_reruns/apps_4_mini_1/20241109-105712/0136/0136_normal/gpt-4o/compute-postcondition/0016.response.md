The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have at most 10^6 digits. The functionality of the function is to perform a specific operation on these two string representations of non-negative integers and return the result. However, the exact output or behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and performs an operation on them, returning a result based on that operation.**
