The code assigns the value '0' to the variable `b`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, which may or may not be '0', and `b` is currently a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros. The previous values of `a` are unaffected by this assignment, and `b` is now explicitly set to '0'.

Output State: **`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer; `b` is '0'**
