The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state specifies that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list containing input strings. The value of `data[1]` will determine the final value of `b`.

If `data[1]` is "00012", for instance, `b` will become "12". If `data[1]` is "0", `b` will become an empty string, which can be treated as "0" for non-negative integers.

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `b` has been updated based on `data[1]`, and its new value is either the same as `data[1]` without leading zeros or an empty string if `data[1]` was all zeros.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the non-negative integer from `data[0]`, `b` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros**
