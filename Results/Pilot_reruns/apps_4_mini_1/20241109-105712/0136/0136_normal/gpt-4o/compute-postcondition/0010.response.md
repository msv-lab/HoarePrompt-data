The code `print('>')` outputs the string `'>'` to the console. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, which is set to '0' if it was initially empty; `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and if `b` is empty, it is updated to '0'**.
