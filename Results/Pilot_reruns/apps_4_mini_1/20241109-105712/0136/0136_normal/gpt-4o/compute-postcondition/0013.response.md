Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, which is '0' if initially empty. `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, which is updated to '0' if initially empty. The program prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This covers all cases, including scenarios where both `a` and `b` may be empty.***
