The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to \(10^6\) digits. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the two integers represented by `a` and `b` as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer strings a and b, and returns their sum as a string.**
