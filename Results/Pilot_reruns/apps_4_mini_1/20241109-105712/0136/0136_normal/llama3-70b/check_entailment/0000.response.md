To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
- We need to compare two very large non-negative integers that can have leading zeroes.
- We should print:
  - "<" if the first number is less than the second.
  - ">" if the first number is greater than the second.
  - "=" if both numbers are equal.

### Program:
```python
a = input().lstrip('0')
b = input().lstrip('0')
if a == b:
    print('=')
elif a < b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('>')
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program reads two lines of input and removes leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`.
2. It then compares the two strings lexicographically.
3. Based on the results of the comparison, it prints the appropriate symbol.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- If both inputs are `"0"` (after stripping leading zeroes, they are equal, should print "=").
- If one input is `"0"` and the other is a string of digits (e.g., `"0000"` vs. `"5"` should print "<" after stripping).
- If both inputs are composed of leading zeroes only (e.g., `"0000"` vs. `"0000"` should print "=").
- If one number has more digits than the other after stripping leading zeroes (e.g., `"000123"` vs. `"123"` should print "=").
- If both numbers are equal but have different representations (e.g., `"0000001"` vs. `"1"` should print "=").

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the program accepts two non-negative integer strings, removes leading zeroes, and correctly compares the strings lexicographically. It states that:
- It prints '=' if the two numbers are equal.
- It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second.
- It prints '>' if the first number is greater than the second.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the comparison of two very large integers represented as strings, including the removal of leading zeroes. It also correctly handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. The output hints align with the functionality of the program.

Given that the program meets the problem requirements for every potential case, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
