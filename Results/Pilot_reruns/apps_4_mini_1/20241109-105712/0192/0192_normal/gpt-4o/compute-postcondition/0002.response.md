The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates with two integer variables `x` and `y`, which must satisfy the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Based on these conditions, the function produces an output, but the specifics of that output are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is focused on the relationship between `x` and `y`. 

Functionality: **The function operates on two integers x and y, which must satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return value is unspecified.**
