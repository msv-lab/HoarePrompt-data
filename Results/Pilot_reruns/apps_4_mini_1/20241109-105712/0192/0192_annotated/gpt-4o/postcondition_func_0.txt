The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where it is guaranteed that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. This means that it returns how many "extra" units are needed to distribute the difference evenly between two entities, assuming that `x` and `y` are valid inputs as per the constraints.
