The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it implies that the function operates on two integers, `x` and `y`, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

Since there is no output description provided in your request, we cannot ascertain specific return values or behavior. Therefore, we can only describe the constraints related to the inputs.

Functionality: **The function operates on two integers x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
