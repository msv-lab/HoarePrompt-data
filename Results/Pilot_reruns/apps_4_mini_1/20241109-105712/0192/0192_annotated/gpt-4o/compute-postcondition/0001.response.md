The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates a value based on the difference between `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are new integers based on input, satisfying the constraints `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. 

1. The term `(x - y)` represents the difference between `x` and `y`, which is guaranteed to be at least 1 since `y < x`.
2. The expression `// 2` performs integer division of the difference by 2.
3. The expression `% 2` calculates the remainder when the difference is divided by 2, which can either be 0 or 1.
4. The two results are added together to yield the final result.

Since `x` and `y` are input integers that satisfy the given constraints, we cannot determine their exact values, but we can denote the difference as `d = x - y`, where `d` is at least 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculations based on the values of `x` and `y`:

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input satisfying 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result of the expression is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**.
