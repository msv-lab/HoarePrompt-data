The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the value of `abs(x - y)` is simply `x - y` since `x` is always greater than `y`. 

Thus, the output state will include the values of `x`, `y`, and the result of `abs(x - y)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the print output is `x - y`**
