To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
The program is supposed to calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birthday among `2^n` possible days, given `k` people. It should output this probability as the irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where both \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime. Additionally, these values should be taken modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   
2. **Edge Case**:
   - If `k > 2^n`, it immediately returns \( (1, 1) \) because it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose `k` people such that none share the same birthday (using a decrementing numerator).
   - `p_no_shared` holds the total number of ways to assign different birthdays, and `p_total` holds the total ways to assign birthdays without any restrictions.
   - It computes the probability of at least two sharing a birthday as \( p_{shared} = p_{total} - p_{no\_shared} \).
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) is used to simplify the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).
   - Finally, it prints \( A \) and \( B \) modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Potential Cases:
1. **When k = 2**: 
   - The output should be \( \frac{1}{2^n} \) for `n = 1` (i.e., \( \frac{1}{2} \)).
   - The output is \( (1, 2) \).

2. **When k > 2^n**: 
   - The output should always be \( (1, 1) \) as per the code logic.

3. **Edge Case where n = 1 and k = 2**:
   - Expected output: \( \frac{1}{2} \) which is \( (1, 2) \) but it outputs \( (1, 1) \).

4. **Large values of n and k**:
   - Given that both `n` and `k` can reach up to \( 10^{18} \), the program needs to correctly compute values without causing overflow or incorrect calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where `k = 2` and `n = 1` correctly. The expected output should be \( (1, 2) \) but the program outputs \( (1, 1) \). This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
