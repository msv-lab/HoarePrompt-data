According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than `k`. 

Since `k` is at least 2, it allows for the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i`, which should be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 1**
