The expression `denominator //= gcd` performs an integer division of `denominator` by `gcd`. Given that `denominator` is 1 and `gcd` is also 1, the result of the division will be `1 // 1`, which equals 1. Therefore, after this operation, `denominator` remains unchanged at 1. The other variables (`k`, `numerator`, and `gcd`) are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`k` is less than 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 1**
