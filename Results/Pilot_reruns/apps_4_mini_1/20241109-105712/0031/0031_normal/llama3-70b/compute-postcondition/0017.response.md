The function returns two values: `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are both 1. The calculation for both would be as follows:

- `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` translates to `1 % (1000003)`, which equals `1`.
- `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` translates to `1 % (1000003)`, which also equals `1`.

The return statement does not change the state of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is `k` is less than 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 1, and the function returns `(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`k` is less than 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 1, and the function returns (1, 1)**
