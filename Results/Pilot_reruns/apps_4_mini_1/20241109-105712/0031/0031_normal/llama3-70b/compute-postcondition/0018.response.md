The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is less than 2, the function returns the tuple (1, 1), where the numerator is 1, the denominator is 1, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is less than 2, it returns the tuple (1, 1).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and if k is less than 2, it returns the tuple (1, 1).**
