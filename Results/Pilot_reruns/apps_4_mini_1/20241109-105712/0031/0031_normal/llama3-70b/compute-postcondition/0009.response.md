According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is between 2 and 10^18. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be increased to 2. The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted because it is already in the valid range for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 2**
