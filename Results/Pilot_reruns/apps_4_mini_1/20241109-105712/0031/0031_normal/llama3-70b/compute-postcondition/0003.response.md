According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `k`. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, it guarantees that the range will include at least two iterations (from 0 to k-1). Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, so it needs to be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `k` is between 2 and 10^18, `i` is now 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
