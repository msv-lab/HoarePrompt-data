According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates `k` times, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. Additionally, `k` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing.

Since `k` is greater than 0 and we know `i` is currently 0, `k` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to run again. There are no other states that need to be adjusted because `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not affect the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is `(2^n) % MOD`, `denominator` is `(2^n) % MOD`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
