The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The initial values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `p_no_shared` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % MOD` for each `i` from `0` to `k-1`, `denominator` is `(2^n)^k % MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, and `p_total` is now equal to `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % MOD` for each `i` from `0` to `k-1`, `denominator` is `(2^n)^k % MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, and `p_total` is equal to `denominator`**
