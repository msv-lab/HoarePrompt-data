The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). 

The functionality of the function is as follows: 
- If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function prints (1, 1) before returning.
- If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function does not print anything and continues execution beyond this block.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds \(2^n\), it outputs (1, 1). If `k` does not exceed \(2^n\), it proceeds without any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and prints (1, 1) if k is greater than 2^n; otherwise, it continues execution without printing.**
