The variable `denominator` is updated by multiplying its previous value by `total_days`, then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` has been defined as `2^n`, which means `denominator` will be calculated as `(denominator * (2^n)) % MOD`.

The initial state indicates that `total_days` is `2^n`, and since `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` will be a very large number but valid under the given constraints.

Assuming `denominator` has a previous value (unknown in this case), the operation will affect `denominator` but not the other variables (`numerator`, `k`, `i`).

Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated `denominator` based on the multiplication with `total_days` and taking the modulus:

Output State: **`denominator` is updated to `(denominator * total_days) % MOD`, where `total_days` is `2^n`, and `numerator`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
