According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged, and we need to determine its value relative to `k`. Since the loop is set to iterate `k` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be equal to `k`. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now equal to `k`, which would mean it is ready to exit the loop after this iteration. 

State: **`denominator` is updated to `(denominator * total_days) % MOD`, `numerator` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to k**
