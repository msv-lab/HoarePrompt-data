The value of `total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. Since `n` is an integer with constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` will hold the value of `2^n`. The conditions regarding `k` and whether it is greater than `2^n` or not do not affect the state after this line of code, assuming that `k` is within the specified range.

Since `total_days` is now defined as `2^n`, the output state reflects the values of `n` and `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`; `total_days` is `2^n`**
