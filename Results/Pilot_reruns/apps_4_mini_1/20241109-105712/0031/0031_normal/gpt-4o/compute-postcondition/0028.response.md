Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and terminates. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates and prints two values based on the results of computations involving `n`, `k`, and a modular arithmetic operation with a modulus of 1000003. The calculations include the products of terms up to `k` and their denominators, which may result in further divisions and modifications before the final output. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 2, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
