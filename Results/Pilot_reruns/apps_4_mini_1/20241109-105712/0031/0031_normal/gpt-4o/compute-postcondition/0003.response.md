Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, and `MOD` is 1000003. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) before returning. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function does not print anything and continues execution beyond this block.***
