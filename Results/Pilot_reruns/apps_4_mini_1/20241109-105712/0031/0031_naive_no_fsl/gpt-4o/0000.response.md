To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze how it implements the logic described in the problem statement regarding the Birthday Paradox in Udayland.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Early Check**: It checks if `k` (the number of people) is greater than `2^n` (the number of days). If true, it immediately concludes that at least two people must share a birthday, hence it outputs `1 1`.
3. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is `2^n`).
   - Two variables `numerator` and `denominator` are initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs for `k` iterations to compute the probabilities:
     - `numerator` accumulates the product of available days as people are added.
     - `denominator` accumulates the total days for each person.
4. **Probability Calculation**: It computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday by subtracting the probability of no shared birthdays from the total.
5. **Reducing the Fraction**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) is computed to reduce the numerator and denominator to their irreducible form.
6. **Final Output**: The results are printed modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Cases to Test:

1. **Minimum Edge Case**: `n = 1`, `k = 2`
   - Expected output: `1 2` (1/2 chance of sharing a birthday).
   
2. **Guaranteed Share Case**: `n = 1`, `k = 3`
   - Expected output: `1 1` (since only 2 days exist and 3 people must share a birthday).

3. **Large Values**: Testing the upper limits where `n` and `k` approach `10^18`:
   - For `n = 60`, `k = 2` (which translates to `2^60` days): The program should compute and return the correct irreducible fraction.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:

- The code handles the case where `k > 2^n` correctly by outputting `1 1`, which aligns with the problem description.
- For cases where `k <= 2^n`, the calculation of the probability seems to follow through correctly, iterating for `k` and calculating the numerator and denominator accordingly.
- The reduction of the fraction to its irreducible form using the GCD is also implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and considering edge cases, it appears that the program adheres to the problem statement and correctly computes the desired output for all specified cases. No counterexamples where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements have been found.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
