To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have \(2^n\) days in a year.
- We want to calculate the probability that at least two of \(k\) people have the same birthday.
- The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \(\frac{A}{B}\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are coprime, and both should be printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(n, k)` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Calculating Total Days**: `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), which is correct.
3. **Numerator and Denominator**:
   - The numerator is computed as the product of \((total_days - i)\) for \(i\) from \(0\) to \(k-1\).
   - The denominator is simply \(total_days^k\).
4. **GCD and Reduction**: The code computes the GCD of the numerator and denominator, reducing both by this GCD to ensure they are coprime.
5. **Modulo Operation**: Finally, both values are taken modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Annotations Review:
The annotations explain the states of variables and the operations performed. They correctly point out the potential issues:
- If \(k\) exceeds \(total_days\), then it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, implying the probability should be \(1\) (i.e., \(A = 1\) and \(B = 1\)).
- The loop will not execute if \(k < 2\), but since the problem states \(k \geq 2\), this is not a concern.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When \(k > total_days\)**: According to the Birthday Paradox, if \(k\) exceeds \(2^n\), the output should be \(1 1\). The current implementation does not handle this case explicitly.
   - For example, if \(n = 1\) and \(k = 3\), \(total_days = 2^1 = 2\). The code would still execute the loop, leading to an incorrect numerator and denominator.

2. **When \(k = 2\)**: This case is handled correctly, as the loop will execute once, calculating the probability correctly as \(\frac{1}{total_days}\).

3. **Extreme Values**: For large values of \(n\) (up to \(10^{18}\)), Python can handle large integers, but the calculation might take too long. However, this does not impact correctness.

### Conclusion:
The code fails to handle the edge case where \(k > total_days\) correctly, and thus does not adhere to the problem description for this scenario. This leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The case where \(n = 1\) and \(k = 3\) illustrates that the code does not return the expected output of \(1 1\), instead producing an incorrect result based on its current logic. The annotations suggest that the function is not considering this edge case, influencing the reasoning that the program is incomplete.
