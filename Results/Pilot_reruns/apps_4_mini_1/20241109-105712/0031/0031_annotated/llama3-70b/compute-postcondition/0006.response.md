According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1 after the current iteration. 

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to reflect that it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. There are no other states that need to be adjusted since `k` remains unchanged and still satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 1**
