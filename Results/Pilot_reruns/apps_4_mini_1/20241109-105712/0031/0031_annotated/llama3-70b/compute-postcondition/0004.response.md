The `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The previous values are `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 0. Therefore, the new value for `numerator` becomes \(1 \times (2^n - 0) = 2^n\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
