The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it calculates a `numerator` which is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`, where `total_days` is calculated as `2^n`. The function also computes a `denominator` which is modified by dividing it by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`. Finally, the function returns the value of `numerator % (10^9 + 7)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, both integers, and returns the result of the calculation numerator % (10^9 + 7) based on the product of total_days - i for i ranging from 0 to k-1, where total_days is defined as 2^n.**
