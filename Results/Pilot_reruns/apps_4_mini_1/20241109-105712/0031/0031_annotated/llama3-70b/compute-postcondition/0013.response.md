Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, `total_days` is `2^n`, and `k` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute. If `k` is less than `2`, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` remains `1`, `denominator` remains `1`, and `i` is undefined.**
