According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `k` is at least 2, `i` can be less than `k` if `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` should be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^(2n) - 2^n) * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is (2^(2n) * total_days), `i` is 3**
