Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`; `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`; `total_days` is `2^n`; `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is now reduced by dividing it by `gcd`.**
