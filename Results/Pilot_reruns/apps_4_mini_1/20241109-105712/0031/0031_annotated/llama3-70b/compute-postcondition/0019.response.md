Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as \(2^n\), and computes a `numerator` as the product of \((total_days - i)\) for \(i\) ranging from \(0\) to \(k-1\), and a `denominator` as \(total_days^k\). After calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the `numerator` and `denominator`, it reduces both by this gcd. Finally, the function returns the values of `numerator` and `denominator`, each taken modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If \(k\) is less than \(2\), the loop does not execute, which would leave the `numerator` as \(1\) and the `denominator` as \(1\).**
