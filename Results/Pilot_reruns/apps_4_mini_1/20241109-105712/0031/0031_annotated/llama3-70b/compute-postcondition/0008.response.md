The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is `2^n`, and `total_days` is also `2^n`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes `2^n * 2^n`, which is `2^(2n)`. The values of other variables, such as `n`, `k`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^(2n) - 2^n, `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is 1**
