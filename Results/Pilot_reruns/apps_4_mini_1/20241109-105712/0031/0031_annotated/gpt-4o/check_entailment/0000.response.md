Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2^n \). According to the problem description, if \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2^n \), we need to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, represented as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

However, the code does not produce any output when \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2^n \). The only scenario where it provides output is when \( k \) is greater than \( 2^n \), in which case it outputs `1 1`, indicating a 100% chance of a shared birthday (which is correct). 

For example, consider the input `3 2`. In this case, \( 2^3 = 8 \), and since \( k = 2 \) is less than or equal to \( 8 \), the expected output is \( 1 \) and \( 8 \) (for a probability of \( \frac{1}{8} \)). However, the code does not produce the correct output for this scenario.

Therefore, as the program fails to provide the correct output for valid cases as per the problem description, it is incorrect.
