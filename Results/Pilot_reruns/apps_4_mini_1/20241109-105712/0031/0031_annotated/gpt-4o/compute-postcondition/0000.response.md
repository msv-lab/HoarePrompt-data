The code assigns a value to the variable `MOD`, which is calculated as `10 ** 6 + 3`. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `k`. The value of `MOD` is computed as `1000003`. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new value of `MOD`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
