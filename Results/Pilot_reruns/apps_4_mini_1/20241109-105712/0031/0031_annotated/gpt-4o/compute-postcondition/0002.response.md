The return statement does not change the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD`. The previous values of these variables remain unchanged. The current output is 1 and 1, which is also unaffected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the output is 1 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the output is 1 1**
