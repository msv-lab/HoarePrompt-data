The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than `2` raised to the power of `n`, the output is `1 1`. However, if `k` is less than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `n`, the code does not produce any output and continues execution beyond this if statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and return `1 1` if `k` is greater than `2` raised to the power of `n`; otherwise, it does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns `1 1` if `k` is greater than `2` raised to the power of `n`; otherwise, it continues without returning any output.**
