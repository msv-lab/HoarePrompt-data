The code updates `denominator` to be `denominator * total_days % MOD`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `denominator`, `total_days`, or `MOD`, so we cannot determine exact numerical results. However, we can describe the impact of the code. 

`denominator` is updated based on its previous value multiplied by `total_days`, and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Since no variable is returned, the output state will reflect the changes.

Output State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`**
