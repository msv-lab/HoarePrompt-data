Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It first checks if `k` exceeds \(2^n\); if so, it outputs `1 1` and terminates. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates a numerator and denominator based on `k` and `n`, but does not output any result for this case. The final output is derived from the calculations of `A` and `B`, which are printed as `(A % MOD, B % MOD)`, where `MOD` is 1000003. However, if `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function will not reach these calculations and outputs nothing beyond the initial check. Thus, the function's output behavior is contingent solely on the value of `k` relative to \(2^n`.**
