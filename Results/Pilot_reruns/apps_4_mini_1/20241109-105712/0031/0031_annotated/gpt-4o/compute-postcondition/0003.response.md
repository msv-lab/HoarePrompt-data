Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the output is 1 1. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the code does not produce any output and continues execution beyond this if statement.***
