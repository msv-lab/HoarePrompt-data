According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `shares` is 0, and the loop will continue without modifying `r`.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1**
