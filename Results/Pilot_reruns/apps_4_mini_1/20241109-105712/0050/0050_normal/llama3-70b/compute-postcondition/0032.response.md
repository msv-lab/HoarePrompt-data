Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged.***
