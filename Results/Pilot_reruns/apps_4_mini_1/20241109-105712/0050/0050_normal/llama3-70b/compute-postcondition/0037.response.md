Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `r`.***
