Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `shares` was greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `r`.***
