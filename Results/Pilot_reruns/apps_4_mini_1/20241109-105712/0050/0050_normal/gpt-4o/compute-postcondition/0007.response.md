The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, where `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`. The value of `remaining_bourles` is the remainder when `r` is divided by `min_buy_price`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the input values and the newly calculated value of `remaining_bourles`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, and `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
