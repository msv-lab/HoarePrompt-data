The line of code creates a list `s` from input values by splitting the input string and converting each split value to an integer. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation, but `s` will hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with the newly created list `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input**
