n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30; r is a positive integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of n positive integers where each integer s_i (1 <= s_i <= 1000) represents the buying price; b is a list of m positive integers where each integer b_i (1 <= b_i <= 1000) represents the selling price.
