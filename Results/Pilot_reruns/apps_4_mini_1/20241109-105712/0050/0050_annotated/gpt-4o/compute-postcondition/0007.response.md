The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, which calculates the remaining amount of money after buying as many shares as possible with the available bourles `r` at the minimum buy price `min_buy_price`. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` are not directly affected by this operation, but their values are crucial for the calculation of `remaining_bourles`. 

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` are not explicitly provided, the output state will reflect that the computation has been made based on these values without specific results.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of input integers representing buy prices; `b` is a list of input integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
