Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of input integers representing buy prices; `b` is a list of input integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `total_bourles` is calculated as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles`, where `max_shares` is the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price` and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and the function prints `total_bourles`. This accounts for scenarios where no shares can be bought or where all available budget is utilized optimally based on the buy and sell prices.***
