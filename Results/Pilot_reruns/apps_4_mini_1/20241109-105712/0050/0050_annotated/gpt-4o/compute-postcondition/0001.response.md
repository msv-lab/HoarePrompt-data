The variable `s` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it takes input as a space-separated string of integers, splits the string into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores them in the list `s`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `s` based on the input provided, while `n`, `m`, and `r` remain as they were.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of input integers representing buy prices.**
