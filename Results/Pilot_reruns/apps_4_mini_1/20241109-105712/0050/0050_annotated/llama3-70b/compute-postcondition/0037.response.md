Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of complete shares that can be bought with `r`, where `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0 or less, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged and `shares` intact.***
