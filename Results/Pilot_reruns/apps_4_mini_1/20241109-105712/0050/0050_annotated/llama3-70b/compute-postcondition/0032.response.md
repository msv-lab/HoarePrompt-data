Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of complete shares that can be bought with `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[1]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0 or negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the initial conditions of `r`, `m`, and `i`.***
