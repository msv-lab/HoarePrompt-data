Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers based on user input in reverse order, and `shares` remains unchanged. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[n - 1]`, `shares` is updated by adding the result of `r // s[n - 1]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[n - 1]`. If `r` is less than `s[n - 1]`, the loop or if statement is exited without any changes to `shares`. This includes the case where `r` is exactly equal to `s[n - 1]`, resulting in `shares` being increased accordingly, and the case where `r` is less than `s[n - 1]`, which leads to an immediate exit from the statement.***
