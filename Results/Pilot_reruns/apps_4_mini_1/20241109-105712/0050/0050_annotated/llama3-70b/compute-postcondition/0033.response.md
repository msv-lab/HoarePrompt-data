According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `m` does not need to change, since it is already greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`shares` is the total number of complete shares that can be bought with `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2**
