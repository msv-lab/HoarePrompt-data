The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from user input, which is converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 30, and `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The exact values of `n`, `m`, and `r` will depend on the input provided by the user. Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values after execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
