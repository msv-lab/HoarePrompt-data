The variable `shares` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the total number of complete shares that can be bought is now `0`, and the previous value of `shares` is not specified. The values of `r`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[1]`, `shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`r` is updated to `r + shares * b[1]`, `shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1**
