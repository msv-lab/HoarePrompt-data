Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers based on user input in reverse order, and `shares` is updated by adding the number of complete shares that can be bought with the current value of `r` using the first element of `s` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks without modifying `shares` or `r`. If `r` is exactly equal to `s[i]`, then `r` will be set to 0 after the operation, and if `r` is greater than `s[i]`, `r` will be reduced to the remainder of `r` after buying the shares. All conditions retain their respective limitations on the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `shares`.***
