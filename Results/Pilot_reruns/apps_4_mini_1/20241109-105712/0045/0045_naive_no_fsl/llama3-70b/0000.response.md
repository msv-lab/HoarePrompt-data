To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and check for any potential edge cases or scenarios where the program may not produce the expected result.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If no such sequence exists, we should return `-1`.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If this is true, it prints `-1`, which is correct because we cannot create a sequence of `k` distinct positive integers that sum to `n` if `n` is less than `k`.
2. The code then attempts to create a sequence by iterating from `1` to `k`. It appends the integers `1, 2, ..., k` to the list `seq`, and reduces `n` by the sum of these integers.
3. If it successfully fills `seq` with `k` integers, it prints them. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- The approach of taking the first `k` integers (`1, 2, ..., k`) may not maximize the GCD unless `n` is exactly equal to the sum of these integers. The sum of the first `k` integers is given by `k * (k + 1) / 2`. If `n` is larger than this sum, the program does not adjust the sequence to maximize the GCD.
- For example, if we have `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program would output `1, 2, 3` (which sums to `6`). However, a valid sequence that sums to `10` and has a higher GCD would be `2, 3, 5` (GCD = 1) or `4, 3, 3` but the latter is not strictly increasing. Thus, it doesn't find the optimal solution.

### Specific Case Where it Fails:
Let's test with:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: A valid GCD maximizing sequence could be `1, 4, 5` (GCD = 1) or `2, 3, 5` (GCD = 1). However, the program generates `1, 2, 3` which sums to `6` and fails.

Given that the program does not reliably generate a sequence that meets the GCD requirements nor does it correctly handle cases where `n` is greater than the sum of the first `k` integers, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
