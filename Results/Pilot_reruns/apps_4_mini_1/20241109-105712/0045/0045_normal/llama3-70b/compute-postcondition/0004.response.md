The code `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. In the initial state, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, the result of `a % b` is non-zero, leading to a new value for `b`.

Given that the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can denote their values as `a_initial` and `b_initial`. After the execution:

- `a` takes the value of `b_initial`.
- `b` is updated to `a_initial % b_initial`, which is guaranteed to be non-zero since `a` is not a multiple of `b`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values based on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b_initial`, `b` is assigned the value of `a_initial % b_initial` (non-zero)**
