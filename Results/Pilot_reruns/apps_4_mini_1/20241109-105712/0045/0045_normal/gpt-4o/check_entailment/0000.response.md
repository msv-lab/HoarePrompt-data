To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both the code and the hints step by step.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` which constructs a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD).

1. **Minimum Sum Check**: The program first calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to create such a sequence.
   
2. **Calculating GCD**: It calculates `d`, which is how many complete sets of this minimum sum can fit into `n`. The sequence is initialized as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which ensures the sequence starts from `d` multiplied by the first `k` integers, thus maintaining the strictly increasing order.

3. **Distributing Remainder**: The program then adjusts the sequence to account for any remaining value after the initial distribution. It starts from the end of the sequence and adds `1` to elements while decrementing the `remainder` until it becomes `0`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case where `n < k`**: If `n` is less than `k`, the minimum sum is greater than `n`, and it returns `-1` correctly.
- **Case where `k = 0`**: The code does not handle this case since `k` is defined to be at least `1` in the problem statement.
- **Case where `k` is negative**: Since the problem specifies positive integers, this case should not occur, but itâ€™s worth noting that the existing function does not explicitly handle it.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints correctly describe the function's behavior in checking for the minimum sum and adjusting the sequence based on the remainder. However, they mention that the function does not handle cases where `k` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This is not relevant since `k` must be positive according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The code does implement the requirements of the problem description accurately for valid inputs of positive integers `n` and `k`. However, it does not handle the negative case for `k` explicitly, though it's not applicable here due to the problem constraints. 

Since the function correctly processes valid inputs and the hints mostly align with the expected behavior, but there is a concern about cases not explicitly handled (though they shouldn't occur based on the constraints), we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly constructs the sequence according to the problem description and handles edge cases as expected.
