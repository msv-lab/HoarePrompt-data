To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `k - 1` down to `0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1`. Since `k` is already defined as a positive integer, this condition is satisfied.

2. The loop variable `i` will start at `k - 1` and decrement to `0`. Therefore, at the beginning of the loop, `i` will be `k - 1`.

3. The `sequence` is constructed as a list of `k` elements: [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]. Since `d` is derived from `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, we can deduce that `sequence` will have valid positive values given that `n` is a positive integer and `min_sum` is positive for any positive `k`.

Now, let's summarize the state adjustments needed:

- Since `k` is a positive integer (at least `1`), `i` must be initialized to `k - 1`.
- `sequence` will have `k` elements, and the last index will be `k - 1`, which is the final value of `i` when the loop starts. 

Thus, we do not need to adjust any other states as they are already defined correctly to ensure the for loop executes.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d], `i` is k - 1**
