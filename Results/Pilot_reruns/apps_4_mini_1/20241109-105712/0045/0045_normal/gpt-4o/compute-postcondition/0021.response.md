According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute again, the index `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, and `k` is at least `2`. 

To execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The value of `i` must be decremented to `-1`, which is the next value `i` will take when the loop executes again.
- The value of `k` does not need to change because it is at least `2`, allowing the loop to run.
- The `remainder` does not need to change since it is not part of the loop's condition.
- The `sequence[i]` will not be relevant for the next iteration as `i` will be `-1`, which is outside the range of valid indices for the sequence.

Thus, the relevant states to adjust are:
- `i` needs to be `-1` for the next iteration to be considered.

State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, `k` is at least 2, `i` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (note that `sequence[-1]` is the last element of the list)**
