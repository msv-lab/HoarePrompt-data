The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d], `i` is k - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
