According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `k - 1` and decrements `i` in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `remainder` was decreased by 1, but we do not know its previous value. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the relationship between `remainder` and the loop execution.

The important states to adjust are for `i`. If `i` was just decremented and is now at 0, for the loop to run one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1, and `k` needs to be at least 2 (so that `k - 1` is at least 1). 

Thus, we need to set `k` to be at least 2, and `i` to be 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
