Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d], and `i` is initialized to `k - 1`. If the `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the conditions for exiting the loop have been met. If `remainder` is not 0, the loop continues as per its design.***
