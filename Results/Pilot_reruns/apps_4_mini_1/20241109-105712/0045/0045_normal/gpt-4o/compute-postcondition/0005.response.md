The variable `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a sequence based on the value of `d` and the range of `k`. Specifically, for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, the expression `d * (i + 1)` is calculated. Since `d` is derived from the initial state as `n // min_sum`, this means that `sequence` will contain `k` elements, where each element is a multiple of `d` starting from `d` up to `d * k`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
- `k` is a positive integer.

The output state will reflect the values of `d`, `k`, and the resulting list `sequence`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]**
