The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`k`, `i`, and `sequence[i]`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `remainder` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
