Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If not, it calculates how many complete sets of this minimum sum fit into `n`, distributes these values into a list called `sequence`, and then adjusts this list based on any remaining value after the distribution. Finally, it returns the `sequence`. If `k` is 0 or if `n` is less than the minimum sum required, it handles these cases by returning -1. The function does not handle cases where `k` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
