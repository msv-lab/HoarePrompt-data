The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum `min_sum`, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return a value. 

In Case 2, if the conditions are met regarding `remainder` and `k`, the function returns a `sequence` that contains values depending on the number of decrements made to `remainder`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, return -1 if the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers exceeds `n`, and return a sequence based on specific conditions otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both positive integers. It returns -1 if the minimum sum of the first k integers exceeds n; otherwise, it returns a sequence based on specific conditions.**
