The code snippet `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `remainder`. As a result, we cannot determine the exact value of `remainder` before the operation. The other variables, including `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i`, remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is that `remainder` is decreased by 1, but we cannot specify its previous value.

Output State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, but its previous value is unknown.**
