The value of `min_sum` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The variables `n` and `k` are positive integers, but we don't have specific values for them. Therefore, `min_sum` will be determined by the value of `k`, but since `k` can be any positive integer within the given range, the output state will reflect that.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2.**
