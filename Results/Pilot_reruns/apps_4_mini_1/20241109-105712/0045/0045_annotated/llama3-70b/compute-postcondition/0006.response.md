Output State: **`if b is non-zero then a will be assigned the value of b and b will be updated to a % b, and this will continue until b becomes 0, at which point a will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b. If b is initially 0, the loop will not execute and a will remain unchanged.`**
