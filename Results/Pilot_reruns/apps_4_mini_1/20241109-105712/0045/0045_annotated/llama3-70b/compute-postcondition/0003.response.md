According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` takes the value of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0. Since `b` is dependent on `a` and `b`, we need to ensure that `a % b` results in a positive integer. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer, we can infer that `a` and `b` need to be adjusted. Specifically, since `b` is being reassigned the value of `a % b`, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than `b` for the modulus operation to yield a positive value.

Thus, to ensure that `b` is greater than 0, we can modify the state to reflect that `a` must be greater than `b`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` takes the value of `b`, `b` takes the value of `a % b` and `a` is greater than `b`**
