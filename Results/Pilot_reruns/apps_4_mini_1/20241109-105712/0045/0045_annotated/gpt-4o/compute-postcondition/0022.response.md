Output State: **`sequence` is a list of size `k` with the first `remainder` elements incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decreased accordingly. If `remainder` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains as `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` is an empty list.**
