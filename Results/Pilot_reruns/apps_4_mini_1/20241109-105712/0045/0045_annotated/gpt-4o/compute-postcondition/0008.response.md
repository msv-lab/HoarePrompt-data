Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, and `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the distribution of `n` into `k` parts is exact with no leftover. In the case of `remainder` being non-zero, the program continues to execute without breaking, suggesting that the distribution is not yet complete.***
