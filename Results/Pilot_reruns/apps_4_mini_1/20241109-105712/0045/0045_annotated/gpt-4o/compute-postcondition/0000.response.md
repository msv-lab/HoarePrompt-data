The code computes `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This formula calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, but the specific value of `k` is not provided, so we cannot calculate a specific numerical result for `min_sum`. The other variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
