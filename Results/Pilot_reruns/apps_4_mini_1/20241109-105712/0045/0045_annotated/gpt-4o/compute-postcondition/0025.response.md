Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum required sum of the first `k` positive integers exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If not, it creates a list of size `k` that contains multiples of a factor derived from dividing `n` by the minimum sum, and then adjusts the first few elements of this list by incrementing them based on the remaining amount after accounting for the minimum sum. Finally, it returns this list. The function does not handle cases where `k` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
