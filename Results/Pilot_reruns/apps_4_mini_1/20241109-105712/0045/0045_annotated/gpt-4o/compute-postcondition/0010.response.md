Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)] with `sequence[i]` increased by 1.**
