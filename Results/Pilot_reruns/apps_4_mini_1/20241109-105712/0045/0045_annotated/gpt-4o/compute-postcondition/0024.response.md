The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum required sum (`min_sum`), calculated as \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \), is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that `n` is sufficient to meet or exceed the minimum required sum.

In Case 2, if the function proceeds to this case, it constructs a list `sequence` of size `k`, where the first `remainder` elements are incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decreased accordingly. The function then returns this `sequence`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the comparison of the calculated minimum required sum with `n`, it either returns -1 or returns a list `sequence` of size `k` with specific elements modified based on `remainder`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. If the minimum required sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1; otherwise, it constructs and returns a list `sequence` of size `k` with the first `remainder` elements incremented by 1.**
