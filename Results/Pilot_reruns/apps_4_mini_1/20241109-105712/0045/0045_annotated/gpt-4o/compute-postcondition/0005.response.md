The variable `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a sequence based on the values of `d` and `k`. The list comprehension iterates over a range of `k` and calculates `d * (i + 1)` for each `i`. 

Since `d` is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `sequence` will contain `k` elements, where each element corresponds to `d` multiplied by the index plus one.

The previous values of `d` and `k` are used to create this list. Other variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `remainder`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated values of `sequence` based on the given initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]**
