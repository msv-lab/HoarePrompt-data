According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `k - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches -1 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `k - 1` again. 

Since `i` is -1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `i` back to `k - 1`. The loop can execute again if `i` is set to `k - 1`, and the initial value of `i` would be `k - 1`. The other states do not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's ability to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` is a list of size `k` containing the values `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[-1]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1.**
