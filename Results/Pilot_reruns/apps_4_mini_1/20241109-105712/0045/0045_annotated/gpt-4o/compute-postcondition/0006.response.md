According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will iterate `k` times, starting from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, ensuring that the range is valid. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop control variable `i` will be `0`. The initial value of `sequence` will be a list containing `k` elements, which means it has valid indices from `0` to `k - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least `1`, and `i` starts at `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)], `i` is `k - 1`**
