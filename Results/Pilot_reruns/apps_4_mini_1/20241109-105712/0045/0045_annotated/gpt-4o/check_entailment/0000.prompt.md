You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, and the function returns -1
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, and the function returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, indicating that `n` is sufficient to meet or exceed the minimum required sum.
    d = n // min_sum
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, and `d` is calculated as n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, and `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum.
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sequence` is a list of size `k` with the first `remainder` elements incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decreased accordingly. If `remainder` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains as `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` is an empty list.
    return sequence
    #State of the program after the return statement: `sequence` is a list of size `k` with the first `remainder` elements incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decreased accordingly; the function returns `sequence`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum required sum of the first `k` positive integers exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If not, it creates a list of size `k` that contains multiples of a factor derived from dividing `n` by the minimum sum, and then adjusts the first few elements of this list by incrementing them based on the remaining amount after accounting for the minimum sum. Finally, it returns this list. The function does not handle cases where `k` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
