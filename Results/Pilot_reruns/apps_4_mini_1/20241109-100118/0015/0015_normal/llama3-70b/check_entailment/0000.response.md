To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both carefully.

The problem description states that we have a sequence starting with an integer `a`, where the difference between consecutive elements is `c`. We need to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in this sequence, which translates to finding a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

Now, let's break down the logic in the code:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Case when `c == 0`:**
   - If `c` is 0, the sequence does not change and remains constant at `a`. The code correctly checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints "YES" if they are equal or "NO" otherwise.

2. **Case when `c != 0`:**
   - The code checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and also checks if `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. 
   - The first condition ensures that `b` can be reached by stepping from `a` with increments of `c`. 
   - The second condition ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is not before `a` in the sequence).

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- If `a` is less than `b`, and `c` is negative, the code would incorrectly return "NO" since it would check for non-negativity of `(b - a) / c`, which would be negative, but `b` should still be reachable in the sequence.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, and `c` is positive, similarly, `(b - a) / c` would be negative, yet `b` could still be part of the sequence.

The output hints mention:
- If `c` is 0 and `a` equals `b`, we should print "YES".
- If `c` is 0 and `a` does not equal `b`, we should print "NO".
- If `c` is not 0, we need to check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative.

Upon reviewing the output hints, they align with the code's logic. However, the edge cases identified earlier indicate that the code fails to handle situations where the direction of the step (`c`) does not match the required direction to reach `b`.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The specific case where the program fails is when `a < b` and `c < 0`, or when `a > b` and `c > 0`, in which the program would incorrectly output "NO" even though `b` could be part of the sequence.
