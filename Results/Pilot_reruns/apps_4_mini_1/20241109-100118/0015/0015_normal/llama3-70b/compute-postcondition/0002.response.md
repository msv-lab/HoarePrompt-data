The code prints `'NO'`, but it does not alter the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as integers assigned from input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed message.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from input as integers, and the output is 'NO'**
