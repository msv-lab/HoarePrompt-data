Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, and `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not divisible by `c`, is negative, or `c` is negative, with cases where `b` is less than `a` leading to 'NO' when `c` is positive. This encompasses all possible relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` and their impact on the output.***
