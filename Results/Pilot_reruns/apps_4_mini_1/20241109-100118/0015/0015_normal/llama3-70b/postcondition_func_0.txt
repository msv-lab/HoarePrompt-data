The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If `c` is 0 and `a` equals `b`, it prints 'YES'; if `c` is 0 and `a` does not equal `b`, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
