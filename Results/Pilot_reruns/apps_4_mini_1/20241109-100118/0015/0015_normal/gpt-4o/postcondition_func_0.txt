The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. It checks if `b` is equal to `a` and prints 'YES' if they are equal. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it checks if `c` is zero, in which case it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not zero, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is a multiple of `c` and whether `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This function handles cases where `c` is zero and checks the signs of `c` and the difference `(b - a)` to determine the output.
