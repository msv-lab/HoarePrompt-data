To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the problem requirements carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if a favorite integer `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence that starts with `a` and has a common difference `c`.
- The sequence is defined as:
  - \( s_1 = a \)
  - \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \times c \) for \( i \geq 1 \)
- We need to output "YES" if `b` exists in this sequence, otherwise "NO".

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
1. **First Condition (`b == a`)**:
   - If `b` is equal to `a`, it correctly returns "YES", which is valid.

2. **Second Condition (`c == 0`)**:
   - If `c` is 0, the sequence does not change; thus, it only consists of the single element `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it correctly returns "NO". This is valid.

3. **Third Condition (`(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if the difference `b - a` is a multiple of `c` (which implies that `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`).
   - The second part checks if the number of steps is non-negative, meaning that it only considers forward progression.
   - This logic is correct for sequences with non-zero `c`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **When `c > 0`**:
   - The sequence increases, so `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` and `(b - a) % c` must equal 0.
  
2. **When `c < 0`**:
   - The sequence decreases, so `b` must be less than or equal to `a`. The condition `(b - a) % c` should still hold, which it does because both `b - a` and `c` will be negative.

3. **When `c = 0` but `b != a`**:
   - Handled correctly by returning "NO".

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints confirm that the function checks these conditions correctly and provides the expected outputs based on the described logic. The hints also mention that it checks the signs of `c` and the difference `(b - a)`, which aligns with the conditions in the code.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing every potential case and confirming that the code checks for all necessary conditions to determine if `b` exists in the sequence, we conclude that the code meets the problem's requirements under all scenarios provided.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it accurately checks if `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by `a` and `c` for all edge cases, including special cases when `c` is zero.
