The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, and the output is 'NO'**
