Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` equals `b`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` does not equal `b`, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, and `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the output is 'YES', indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO', indicating that the difference is either not a multiple of `c` or is negative. This includes handling the edge case where `c` is zero to avoid division by zero errors.***
