The function reads three integers from input: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is zero, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is non-zero, it checks if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This includes edge cases for when `b` equals `a`, when `c` is zero, and when the conditions for divisibility and non-negativity are evaluated. The function does not return any value.
