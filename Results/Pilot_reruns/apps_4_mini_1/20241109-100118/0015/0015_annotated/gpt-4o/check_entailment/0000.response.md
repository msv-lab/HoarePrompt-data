To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**: 
   - We need to check if the integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the starting integer `a` and the common difference `c`. The sequence can be represented as: 
     - \( s_1 = a \)
     - \( s_2 = a + c \)
     - \( s_3 = a + 2c \)
     - ...
   - We need to determine if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program first checks if \( b \) is equal to \( a \). If they are equal, it prints "YES".
   - If \( c \) is zero, it checks that \( b \) is not equal to \( a \); in this case, it prints "NO" because the sequence would consist of only the number \( a \).
   - If \( c \) is not zero, it checks if \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) and if the quotient \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Examining Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( c = 0 \) correctly by checking if \( b \) is equal to \( a \).
   - If \( c \) is positive, \( b \) must be greater than or equal to \( a \) for it to be in the sequence, and \( (b - a) \% c \) must equal zero.
   - If \( c \) is negative, \( b \) must be less than or equal to \( a \) for it to potentially be in the sequence, and again \( (b - a) \% c \) must equal zero.

4. **Examples Provided in the Problem Description**:
   - For input `1 7 3`, the output is "YES" because the sequence is `1, 4, 7`.
   - For input `10 10 0`, the output is "YES" because `b` is equal to `a`.
   - For input `1 -4 5`, the output is "NO" because all elements in the sequence are greater than `b`.
   - For input `0 60 50`, the output is "NO" because the sequence is `0, 50, 100, ...`, and all elements are less than `60`.

5. **Annotations Review**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points and include checks for edge cases. They emphasize that the conditions for divisibility and non-negativity are crucial for determining if `b` is in the sequence.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - After carefully verifying the problem description, the code logic, and the examples given, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality for all potential cases described in the problem.

Thus, the final determination of correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
