Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned values from input within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This condition checks that the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative, which includes the edge cases where `c` is zero (where division by zero would lead to an error), and when `b` is equal to `a` (yielding a difference of zero).***
