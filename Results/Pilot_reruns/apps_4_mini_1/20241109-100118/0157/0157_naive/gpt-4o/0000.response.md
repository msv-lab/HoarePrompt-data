Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:
1. It takes three inputs representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum of:
   - the number of lemons available (`a`),
   - the number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), which accounts for the required ratio,
   - the number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`), which also accounts for the required ratio.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used based on the found `max_lemons` using the formula: `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
4. Finally, it prints the total.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when any of the fruits are insufficient to meet the ratio requirements, resulting in a total of 0. Thus, it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
