To calculate the output state, we first analyze the expression involving `min_lemon`, which is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `a` is an input integer (value unknown).
   - `b` is an input integer (value unknown).
   - `c` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ c ≤ 1000` (specific value unknown).
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

2. **Calculation in `print()`**:
   - The expression inside the `print()` function evaluates to:
     \[
     \text{min_lemon} + \text{min_lemon} \times 2 + \text{min_lemon} \times 4
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{min_lemon} + 2 \times \text{min_lemon} + 4 \times \text{min_lemon} = 7 \times \text{min_lemon}
     \]

3. **Output State**: 
   - The output does not change the state of `a`, `b`, or `c`, but it does compute a value based on `min_lemon`. 
   - The final output is based on the computed value `7 * min_lemon`.

Thus, the output state reflects the results of the computations.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000, and the output is `7 * min_lemon` where `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
