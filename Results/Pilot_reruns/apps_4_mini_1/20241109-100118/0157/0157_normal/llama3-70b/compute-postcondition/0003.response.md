The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and `c` is a positive integer within the specified range. The operation `b // 2` divides `b` by 2 using floor division, and `c // 4` divides `c` by 4, also using floor division. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, the computed value of `b // 2`, the computed value of `c // 4`, and the resulting value of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
