To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we evaluate the expression for `max_lemons`.

1. `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, with `c` specifically being a positive integer.
3. The operation `b // 2` computes the integer division of `b` by 2.
4. The operation `c // 4` computes the integer division of `c` by 4.

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `max_lemons`. However, we can express the relationship.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer, and `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
