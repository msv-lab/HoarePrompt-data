The function `func` does not have any parameters, as it is defined with an empty parentheses. However, based on the provided constraints, it is inferred that the function is designed to work with three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of which falls within the range of 1 to 1000. Since there is no specific output description provided in the output section, we cannot determine the exact return value or conditions. Therefore, the functionality can only be stated as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but is intended to work with three positive integers a, b, and c, each ranging from 1 to 1000. The specific return values or conditions are not provided.**
