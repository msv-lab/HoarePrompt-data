The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for three integer inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be produced based on the constraints that `a` represents the number of lemons, `b` represents the number of fruits that can be used to make lemonade (where each lemonade requires 2 fruits), and `c` represents the number of fruits that can be used to make juice (where each juice requires 4 fruits). The total number of fruits produced is then calculated as `max_lemons * 7`, where `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Finally, the function prints the total number of fruits. The function does not handle any invalid input cases or conditions where the inputs are outside the specified ranges.
