The variable `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`, where `max_lemons` is assigned the value `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their specific values will determine `max_lemons` and subsequently `total_fruits`. The print statement will output the value of `total_fruits`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since these are input integers and not specified, we can summarize the output state in terms of their relationships:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000; `max_lemons` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`); `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and the function prints `total_fruits`.**
