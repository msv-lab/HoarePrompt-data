The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are implied to be defined elsewhere in the code or context. The function will return a value based on the conditions that these integers meet. However, since no specific output conditions or cases are provided in the output, the functionality cannot be fully described in detail.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three positive integers a, b, and c, which must be defined elsewhere.**
