To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, we need to analyze the code, its logic, and how it relates to the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay needs to make a compote with the fruits in the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The goal is to find the maximum total number of fruits he can use given the quantities of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The output should be the maximum total number of fruits used, or 0 if he cannot use any fruits.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Inputs**:
   - The program reads three integers a, b, and c, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.
   
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**:
   - The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
     - `a` represents the number of lemons.
     - `b // 2` calculates how many lemons can be paired with apples, since each lemon requires 2 apples.
     - `c // 4` calculates how many lemons can be paired with pears, since each lemon requires 4 pears.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**:
   - The total fruits used is computed as `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`. This correctly reflects the total count of fruits used based on the ratio.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of fruits.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- The program must ensure that if there are insufficient fruits to meet the required ratios, it should output 0. 
- The code correctly computes this because if `max_lemons` is 0, `total_fruits` will also be 0.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations describe the state of the program and the logic behind the calculations. They confirm that the program calculates `max_lemons` correctly and computes the total number of fruits accurately based on the maximum lemons that can be used. 

### Testing Examples:
1. **Example 1**: Inputs: 2, 5, 7 → Output: 7
   - Calculation: 1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears → Total = 7 (Correct)
   
2. **Example 2**: Inputs: 4, 7, 13 → Output: 21
   - Calculation: 3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears → Total = 21 (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: Inputs: 2, 3, 2 → Output: 0
   - Calculation: Not enough pears to make any compote → Total = 0 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, with no missing edge cases or logical errors. The annotations do not introduce any incorrect assumptions and affirm the program's logic. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
