Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be made based on the input values, where `b` represents the number of pairs (2 lemons) and `c` represents the number of quartets (4 lemons). The function computes the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, then outputs the total number of lemons that can be made, which is `min_lemon * 7`. The function has no explicit return value. **
