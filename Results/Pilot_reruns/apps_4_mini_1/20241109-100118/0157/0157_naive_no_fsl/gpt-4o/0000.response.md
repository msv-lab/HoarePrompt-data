Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum possible number of lemons that can be used in the compote:
   - `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of:
     - `a` (the number of lemons available),
     - `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples, since each lemon requires 2 apples),
     - `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears, since each lemon requires 4 pears).
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote:
   - Each lemon contributes 1, each pair of apples contributes 2, and each group of pears contributes 4, leading to the formula: `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including situations where there are insufficient fruits to make even a single compote (e.g., if the number of pears is less than 4, resulting in `max_lemons` being 0). 

All test cases provided in the problem description yield the correct outputs as per the specifications. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
