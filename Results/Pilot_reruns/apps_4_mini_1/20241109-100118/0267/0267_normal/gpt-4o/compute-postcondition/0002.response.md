In the provided code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` (which is equal to `l`), and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_sum` is initially 0. The exact values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `MOD` are not provided, but we know the constraints for these variables.

1. The initial state is:
   - `total_sum` = 0
   - `num` = `l` (where 1 <= `l` <= `r` and `l` <= `r` < 10^18)
   
2. The operation performed is:
   - `total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD`
   - Substituting the values: `total_sum = (0 + l) % MOD`
   - Hence, `total_sum` becomes `l % MOD`.

Since the exact value of `l` and `MOD` is not specified, we can only state that `total_sum` is now equal to `l` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`**
