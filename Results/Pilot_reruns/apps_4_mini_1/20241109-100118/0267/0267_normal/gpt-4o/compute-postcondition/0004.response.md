According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r`, `r` is an integer such that `l <= r < 10^18`, and `num` is equal to `l`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be incremented. Thus, if `num` is currently `l`, for the loop to execute again, `num` should be equal to `l + 1`. Additionally, since `num` must also remain less than or equal to `r`, it is necessary that `l + 1` is still less than or equal to `r`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `num` is now `l + 1`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged as it is initialized to 0.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l + 1`**
