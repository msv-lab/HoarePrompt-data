Postcondition: ***`l` is such that 1 <= `l` <= `r - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (l + 2)) % MOD` if `func_1(l + 2, k)` returns True; otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged. The variable `num` is equal to `l + 2`.***
