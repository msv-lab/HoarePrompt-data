According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is within the range defined by `l` and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 2`. Since `l` is such that `1 <= l <= r - 1`, `r` is at least `l + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to `l + 3`, and it must still be within the range up to `r`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `num` is now `l + 3`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged unless `func_1(l + 3, k)` is evaluated, but since the loop execution does not depend on that directly, we do not need to adjust `total_sum`.

State: **`l` is such that 1 <= `l` <= `r - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (l + 2)) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 3`.**
