Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range [l, r] for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If the range contains no integers satisfying `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` will also remain 0.**
