According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that it is stated that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, the conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied. 

Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we also need to consider the initial state of `num`. The loop starts with `num` equal to `l`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `num` should be initialized to `l`, and since the loop can iterate through the range from `l` to `r`, we do not need to adjust `l` or `r`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
