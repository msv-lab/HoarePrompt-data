Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; if `n` is less than `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to 9, and if `k` is greater than 1, it is further adjusted based on the calculations involving powers of 10 and the value of `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9. In all cases, the function does not return anything.***
