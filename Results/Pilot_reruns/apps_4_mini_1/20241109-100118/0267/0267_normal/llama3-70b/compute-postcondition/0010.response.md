According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 and going up to `k - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `k - 1` (since the loop iterates from 1 to `k - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than `k - 1`, which implies that `k` must be at least `k` or more.

Given that `dp[n, k]` is updated, we do not need to change that state. 

Thus, the necessary adjustment involves ensuring that `k` must be greater than the previous value of `k - 1`, which means `k` should be at least `k + 1`.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated from 9 to `9 + 9 * 10`, `k` is greater than `k`**
