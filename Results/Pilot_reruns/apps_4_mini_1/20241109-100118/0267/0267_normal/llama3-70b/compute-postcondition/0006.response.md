According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2 (since the range function excludes the upper bound). Additionally, before the loop starts, we need to initialize `i` to the starting value of 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is initialized to 1. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is assigned the value 9, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
