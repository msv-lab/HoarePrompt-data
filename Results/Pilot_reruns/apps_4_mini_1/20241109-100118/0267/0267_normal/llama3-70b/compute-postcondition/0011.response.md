The expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` based on the current values of `i` and `k`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is 9. The value will be modified by adding the result of the multiplication involving powers of 10.

Since `dp[n, k]` is updated from 9, we calculate the new value:
- The initial value is 9.
- The term added is `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`.

This means that:
1. The existing value of `dp[n, k]` is 9.
2. The term being added is calculated from `i` and `k`, which are unspecified but we know `k` is greater than `k` (which may be a typo in the initial state).

The new state of `dp[n, k]` will depend on the calculation but it will be 9 plus some positive value derived from the multiplication. Assuming all parts of the equation evaluate to a non-negative number, the output will reflect the fact that `dp[n, k]` has changed. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated from 9 to a new value based on the calculation, `k` is greater than `k`.**
