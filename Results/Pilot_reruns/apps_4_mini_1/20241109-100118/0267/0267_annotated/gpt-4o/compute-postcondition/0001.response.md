According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is guaranteed by the initial conditions given (1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18). 

Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0, which is irrelevant to the execution of the loop. However, we need to establish the initial values of the loop variable `num`. The loop variable `num` will start at `l`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute properly:
- `num` should be initialized to `l`, which is the starting point of the range.
- The condition that `l` is less than or equal to `r` is already satisfied.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `num` is `l`**
