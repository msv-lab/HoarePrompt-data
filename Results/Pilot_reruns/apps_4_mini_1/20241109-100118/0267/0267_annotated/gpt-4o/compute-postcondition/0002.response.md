The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it, then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, after execution, `total_sum` will be equal to `l % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` are not changed, but `total_sum` is modified.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `num` is `l`**
