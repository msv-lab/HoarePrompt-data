Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` equals `r` and `func_1(l, k)` returns false, `total_sum` will also remain 0. If `l` is at least 1 and `r` is at least `l`, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `num` will be equal to `r + 1`.**
