The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it, and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_sum` before this operation is 0, and `num` has a value of `l + 2`. This results in `total_sum` being updated to `(0 + (l + 2)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 2) % MOD`.

As `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, the exact value of `total_sum` after this operation would depend on the specific values of `l` and `MOD`. However, since `MOD` is not defined, we can only express `total_sum` in terms of `l`.

Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is updated to `(l + 2) % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`.

Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(l + 2) % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, and `num` is equal to `l + 2**
