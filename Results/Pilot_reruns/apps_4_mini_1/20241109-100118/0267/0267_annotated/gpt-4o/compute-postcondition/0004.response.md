According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, which means that in the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1. 

Given that `l` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18} \), for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be less than or equal to `r`. Since `num` is currently equal to `l`, which is less than or equal to `r`, it will increment to `l + 1` in the next iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust `num` to `l + 1` for the next iteration. The values of `total_sum`, `l`, and `r` do not need to change as they are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`**
