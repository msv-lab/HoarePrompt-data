Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`. If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is computed based on the specified formula, which includes setting `dp[n, k]` to 9 initially, followed by cumulative updates based on the loop for values of `i` from 1 to `k-1`, and finally adjusting based on the last term which involves `n // 10 ** (k - 1)`. The final value is taken modulo `MOD`.***
