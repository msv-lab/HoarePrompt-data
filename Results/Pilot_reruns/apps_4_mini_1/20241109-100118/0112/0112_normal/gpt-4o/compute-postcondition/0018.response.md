Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 and has been adjusted to at least 4; `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`, with at least 1 character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `i` is `n`; if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `used_cubes[i]` or `found`.***
