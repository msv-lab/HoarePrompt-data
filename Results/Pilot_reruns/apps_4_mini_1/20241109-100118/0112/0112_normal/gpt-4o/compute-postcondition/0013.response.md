Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `i` is `n`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, and `found` is set to True, indicating that a cube has been successfully used, and we break out of the most internal loop. If `used_cubes[i]` is True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, no changes occur to `used_cubes[i]` or `found`.***
