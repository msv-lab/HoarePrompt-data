The code `digits = list(str(num))` converts the integer `num` to a string and then creates a list of its characters (digits). However, the value of `num` is not specified in the initial state. Since `num` is not mentioned, we cannot determine its specific value, but we know it is an integer. The output state will reflect the general condition that `digits` will be a list of characters derived from `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers each; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`.**
