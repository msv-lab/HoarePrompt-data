According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means that the loop cannot execute again, since the loop's condition `for i in range(n)` will not be satisfied if `i` is equal to or greater than `n`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `i`. Since `i` is currently `n`, `n` must be adjusted to at least `n + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 4; `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`, with at least 1 character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `i` is `n`**
