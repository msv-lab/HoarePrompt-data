The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `num` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list containing `num` lists, where each inner list consists of 6 integers representing the faces of the cubes, with each integer in the range 0 to 9. 

After executing the function, the following cases occur:

**Case 1**: If `num` is in the range [1, 3] and if all digits in `digits` can be found in `cube_faces[i]` for some `i` where `used_cubes[i]` is False, then the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` will be set to True for each digit. If any digit cannot be matched with a corresponding unused cube, the function returns `False`. If `num` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the function will return `False` without executing the loop. If `digits` is empty, the function returns `True` without executing the loop.

**Case 2**: If `num` is in the range [1, 3] and all digits in `digits` can be matched with the corresponding cubes, the function will return `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, and determine whether the digits can be formed using the faces of the cubes while managing the usage of the cubes accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`. It returns `False` if the digits cannot be formed with the available cubes or if `num` is outside the range [1, 3]. It returns `True` if all digits can be formed with the cubes or if `digits` is empty.**
