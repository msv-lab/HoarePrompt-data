The variable `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The value of `i` is currently 0, which means that the first element of the `used_cubes` list is updated to `True`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `used_cubes` while noting the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[0]` is True**.
