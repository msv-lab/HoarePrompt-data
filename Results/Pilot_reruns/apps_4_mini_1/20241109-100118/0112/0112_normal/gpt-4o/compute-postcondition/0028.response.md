Output State: **If `n` is in the range [1, 3] and if all digits in `digits` are found in `cube_faces[i]` for some `i` where `used_cubes[i]` is False, then the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` for that index will be set to True for each digit. If any digit cannot be matched with a corresponding unused cube, `found` remains False and the function returns False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and the function returns False. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and the function returns True.**
