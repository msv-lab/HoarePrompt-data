The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is constrained such that it must be an integer in the range of 1 to 3. Other variables remain unaffected at this stage. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3**
