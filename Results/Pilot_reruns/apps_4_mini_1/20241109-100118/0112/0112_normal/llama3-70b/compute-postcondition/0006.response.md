The `digits` set is updated with the string representations of each integer in `cube`. The initial state indicates that `cubes` contains at least 2 lists of integers, and `cube` is the second list within `cubes`. Since `n` is either 2 or 3, we focus on the contents of `cube`, which can include multiple integers.

The impact of the code is that each integer in `cube` is converted to a string and added to the `digits` set. The previous state of `digits` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know it will now include new string values based on the integers present in `cube`.

Since the exact content of `cube` and the initial state of `digits` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact values added to `digits`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `digits` has been updated with the string representations of the integers from the second list in `cubes`.

Output State: **`digits` is updated with string representations of each integer in `cube`**
