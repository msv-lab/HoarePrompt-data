According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If there are still more elements in `cubes`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has been updated with string representations of each integer in `cube`, but we do not have information about the current index of `cube` or the remaining elements in `cubes`.

Since we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that there is at least one more element in `cubes`. Therefore, the state should indicate that there is still at least one more `cube` in `cubes`.

State: **`digits` is updated with string representations of each integer in `cube`, `cubes` has at least one more element remaining**
