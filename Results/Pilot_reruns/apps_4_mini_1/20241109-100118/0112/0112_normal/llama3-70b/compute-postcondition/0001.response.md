The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The number of inner lists is equal to `n`, which can be either 1, 2, or 3. The exact values of the inner lists will depend on the input provided during execution. Since the values of `n` and the input are not specified, the output state describes the range of values for `n` and the structure of `cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers**
