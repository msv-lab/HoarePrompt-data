According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 (inclusive), the `cubes` list must contain at least 1 sublist (since the loop iterates over `cubes`). The loop will iterate over each `cube` in `cubes`, starting from the first element. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `cubes` contains at least 1 element, and we also need to specify the current state of `cube` at the start of the loop. Since the first iteration will begin with the first element of `cubes`, `cube` should be set to the first sublist in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
