According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, and `cube` is currently the third list in `cubes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more list in `cubes`, so that `cube` can be the fourth list in the next iteration. Therefore, `cubes` must contain at least 4 lists, and `cube` will then reference the fourth list in `cubes`. 

Additionally, since the loop variable `cube` gets updated to the next list in each iteration, after the next iteration, `cube` will be the fourth list and `digits` will need to be updated accordingly based on that list.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 4 lists, `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of the digits in `cube`**
