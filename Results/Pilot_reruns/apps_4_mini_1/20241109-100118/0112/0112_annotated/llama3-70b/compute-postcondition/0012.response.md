Postcondition: ***`digits` contains string representations of all unique digits found in the lists contained in `cubes`. If '0' was present in `digits`, it is removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged. In cases where `cubes` is empty or contains no lists, `digits` is an empty set. The total number of unique digits present in `digits` remains unchanged except for the potential removal of '0'.***
