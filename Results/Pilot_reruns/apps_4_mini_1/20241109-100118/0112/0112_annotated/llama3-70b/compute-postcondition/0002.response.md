The code initializes an empty set called `digits`. The previous values of the variables `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n` and `cubes`, while `digits` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 (inclusive), `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers from `input()` for `n` iterations, and `digits` is an empty set**.
