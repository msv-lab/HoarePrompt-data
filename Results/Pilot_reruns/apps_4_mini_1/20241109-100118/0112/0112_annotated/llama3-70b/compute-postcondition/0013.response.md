The value of `max_num` is assigned the value of the integer formed by joining the sorted `digits` in descending order. The state of `digits` is affected only if '0' was present, as it would have been removed, otherwise it remains unchanged. The total number of unique digits remains unchanged except for the potential removal of '0'. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `digits` and the computed value of `max_num`.

Output State: **`digits` contains string representations of unique digits, and `max_num` is the integer formed by joining `digits` in descending order.**
