The `digits` set is updated with string representations of the digits in `cube`. The previous contents of `digits` will be combined with the new elements generated from `cube`. The values of `n` and `cubes` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `digits`, which now includes the string representations of all digits present in the `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated with string representations of the digits in `cube`**.
