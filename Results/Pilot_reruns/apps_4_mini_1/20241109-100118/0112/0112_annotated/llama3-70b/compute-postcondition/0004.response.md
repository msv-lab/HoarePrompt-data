The `digits` set is updated with string representations of each `digit` in the `cube` list. The specific contents of `cube` aren't provided, but since it is the first list in `cubes`, we can assume it contains some digits. The `digits` set will now include these string representations of the digits from `cube`. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, `cube` will likely contain at least one digit (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.). The previous state of `digits` was an empty set, so after the update, `digits` will contain the string representations of the digits found in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` now contains string representations of the digits in `cube`**
