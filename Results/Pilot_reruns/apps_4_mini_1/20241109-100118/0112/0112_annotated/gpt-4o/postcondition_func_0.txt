The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 3) and a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of cubes. It returns the largest integer `x` such that the function `can_form_number(x)` returns True, starting from 1 and incrementing until it finds the largest `x` for which this condition holds. If `can_form_number(1)` is false, the function will return 0. If `can_form_number(x)` is not defined for all integers, the function may not check all possible values of `x` up to the largest possible integer representable.
