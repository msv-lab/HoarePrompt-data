The code initializes the list `used_cubes` with `False` values, creating a list of length `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will contain `n` `False` values. The other variables (`cube_faces` and `digits`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists; `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num; `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists; `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num; `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values**
