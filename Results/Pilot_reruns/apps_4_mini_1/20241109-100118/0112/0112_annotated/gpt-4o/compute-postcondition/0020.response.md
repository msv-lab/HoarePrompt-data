Output State: **If `n` is at least 1 and `digit` is found in the first `cube_faces[0]`, then `used_cubes[0]` is True and `found` is True. If `digit` is not found, `used_cubes[0]` remains False and `found` is unchanged. If `n` is at least 2 and the loop executes a second time, if `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is True and `found` is True. If not, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3 and the loop executes a third time, if `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is True and `found` is True. If not, `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all values remain unchanged, with `used_cubes` containing all False values and `found` being False.**
