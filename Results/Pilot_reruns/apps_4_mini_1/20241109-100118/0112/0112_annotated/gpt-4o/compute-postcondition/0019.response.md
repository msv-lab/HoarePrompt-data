According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and it should still be less than `n`. However, since `n` is at least 2, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in `num` with at least 1 element.**
