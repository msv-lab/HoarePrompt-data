The code assigns the value `True` to `used_cubes[i]`. Since `i` is 1, the second element of the `used_cubes` list is updated to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is updated to have `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, and `found` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is updated to have `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, and `found` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]`**.
