The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\), and `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, with each integer \(a_{i,j}\) satisfying \(0 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 9\). 

The functionality of the function is as follows: 

- **Case 1**: If `n` is at least 1 and every digit of `num` can be matched to the faces of the cubes, the function returns `True`. If any digit cannot be matched, the function returns `False` immediately. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function does not execute the loop and returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if the number formed by the digits of `num` can be represented by the faces of the cubes as defined in `cube_faces`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 1 and 3) and `cube_faces` (a list of n lists of integers). It returns `True` if all digits of `num` can be matched to the cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns `True` without processing the cubes.**
