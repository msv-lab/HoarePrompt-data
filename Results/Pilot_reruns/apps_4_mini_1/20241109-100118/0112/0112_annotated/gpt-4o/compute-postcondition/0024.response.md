The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its previous state. The initial state of `found` is unchanged, but now it explicitly becomes `False`. The other variables (`n` and `used_cubes`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 4, `used_cubes` contains True values for indices where digits were found, and `found` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `used_cubes` contains True values for indices where digits were found, and `found` is False**
