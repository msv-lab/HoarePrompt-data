According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be updated from 1 to 2. The other states (`n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits`) do not need to be changed as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, and `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in `num` with at least 1 element**
