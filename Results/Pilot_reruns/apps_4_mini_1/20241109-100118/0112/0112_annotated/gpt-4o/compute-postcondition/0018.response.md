Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in `num` with at least 1 element. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True, indicating that a cube has been successfully used; otherwise, there is no change to the state of `used_cubes` or `found`.***
