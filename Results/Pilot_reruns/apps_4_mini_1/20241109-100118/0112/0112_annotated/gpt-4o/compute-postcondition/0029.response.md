Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `used_cubes` will have True values for indices corresponding to the digits found in `cube_faces`, and `found` will be True for the first digit that was successfully matched; the function returns True. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, all values remain unchanged with `used_cubes` containing all False values and `found` being False, and the function returns True.**
