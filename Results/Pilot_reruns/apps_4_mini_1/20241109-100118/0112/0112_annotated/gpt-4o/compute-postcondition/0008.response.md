Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is set to True if `digit` (the first element in `digits`) is found in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged with the first element still False. The variable `found` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, indicating that a match was found, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
