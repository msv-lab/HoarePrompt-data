Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, and `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in `num` with at least 1 element. If `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged and `found` retains its previous state.***
