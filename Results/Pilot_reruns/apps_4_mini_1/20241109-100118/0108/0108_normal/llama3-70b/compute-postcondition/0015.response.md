The value of `res` is incremented by appending `char` to it. Since `char` is 'a', the new value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'a'. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z'. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` while acknowledging the initial conditions.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z'; `char` is 'a'; `res` is updated by appending 'a'**
