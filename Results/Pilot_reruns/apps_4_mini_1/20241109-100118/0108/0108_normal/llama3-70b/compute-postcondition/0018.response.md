The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is 'a'. Therefore, `res` will now include an additional 'a'. The values of `s` and `char` do not change, so the output state is: `s` is updated to include 'a', `char` is 'a', and `res` is updated by appending 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is updated to include 'a', `char` is 'a', and `res` is updated by appending 'a'**
