Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character is repeated according to its original occurrences in `s` before any replacements. `s` will be modified such that each character from 'a' to 'z' is replaced with the next character in the Unicode sequence until no characters remain. If `s` initially does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string, while `s` remains unchanged.**
