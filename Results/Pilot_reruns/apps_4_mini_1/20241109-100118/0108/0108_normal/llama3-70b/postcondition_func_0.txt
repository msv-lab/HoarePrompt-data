The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` that contains each letter from 'a' to 'z' according to its occurrences in `s`, replacing each occurrence of a character with the next character in the Unicode sequence. If `res` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters directly but takes input from the user. It also does not handle cases where the input string might contain characters outside the specified range, nor does it validate the input length.
