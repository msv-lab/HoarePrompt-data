The variable `target_len` is assigned the value `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string stored in the variable `target`. The value of `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. Therefore, after execution, `target_len` will be 26. The state of variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**
