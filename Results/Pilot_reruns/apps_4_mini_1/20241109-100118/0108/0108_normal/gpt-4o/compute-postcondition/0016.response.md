Output State: **`if the string s contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then j will be 26 and i will equal the length of s. If s does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', then j will be less than 26 and i will equal the length of s or some value less than that based on the characters found. If s is empty or does not begin with 'a', then the loop will not execute, i will be 0, and j will remain 0.`**
