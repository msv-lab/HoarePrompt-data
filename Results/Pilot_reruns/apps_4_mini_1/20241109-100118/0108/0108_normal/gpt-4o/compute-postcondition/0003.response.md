The values of `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. The other variables (`s`, `target`, and `target_len`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.
