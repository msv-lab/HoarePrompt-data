Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is already at 26, it indicates all characters of `target` have been matched.***
