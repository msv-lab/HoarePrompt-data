Output State: **`if s contains at least one 'a', then res is a string of 'a's repeated n times, where n is the number of occurrences of 'a' in the initial string, and s will have n 'a's replaced with 'b's. After the loop, char will be 'b'. If s does not contain 'a', the loop doesn't execute, and res remains unchanged from its initial value.**
