The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The value of `s` will change, but the other variables remain unaffected. Since we know that `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, we can conclude that the replacement will be successful.

After executing the code, the output state reflects the updated value of `s` while keeping the previous values of `res` and `char` unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is 'b' followed by 'a's repeated `n-1` times plus `char` plus `char`; `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence**
