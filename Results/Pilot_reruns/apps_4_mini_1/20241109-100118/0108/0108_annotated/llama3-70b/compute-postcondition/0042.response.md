The function `func` accepts an input string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a result string `res` by sorting the characters in `s` in alphabetical order and repeating each character according to its occurrences in `s`. After processing all characters from 'a' to 'z', if `res` contains exactly 26 characters (indicating that all letters from 'a' to 'z' are present), it prints the result. If `res` does not contain 26 characters (which occurs if `s` is empty, contains letters outside the alphabet, or does not include all letters from 'a' to 'z'), it prints -1. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of lowercase English letters and prints the sorted string if it contains all letters from 'a' to 'z'; otherwise, it prints -1. **
