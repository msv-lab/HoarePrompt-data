The variable `res` is updated by appending `char` to its current value. The initial state of `res` is 'b' followed by 'a's repeated `n-1` times plus `char`, and `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will now include the additional `char` at the end of its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is 'b' followed by 'a's repeated `n-1` times plus `char` plus `char`; `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
