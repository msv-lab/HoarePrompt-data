The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string `''`. The other variable `s` remains unchanged as it is an input string, and `alphabet` also remains unchanged as it is defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string.**
