The function accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from user input. It checks if `s` contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z'). If it does, the function prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle empty input, and if `s` is empty, it will print -1, as no letters can be matched. Additionally, the function only checks for the presence of the letters but does not validate the input string for non-lowercase characters or other unexpected inputs.
