Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input. If the character at position `i` in `s` matches the character at position `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. If there is no match, `j` remains 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged.***
