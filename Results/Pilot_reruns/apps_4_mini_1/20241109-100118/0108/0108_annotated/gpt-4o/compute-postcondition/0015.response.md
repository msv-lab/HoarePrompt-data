According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1. This means `len(s)` must be at least `i + 1` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `len(s)` is greater than `i`, we can conclude that the current value of `i` is less than `len(s)`. However, we need to ensure that `j` is also less than `target_len` for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is currently less than `target_len`.

Thus, no specific adjustments to `i` or `len(s)` are necessary, but we need to ensure the condition on `j` holds.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than 1, and `j` is less than `target_len`**
