The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` remains unchanged as its previous value is not specified. The string `s` and its contents are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `i` while noting the state of `j`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` remains 1**.
