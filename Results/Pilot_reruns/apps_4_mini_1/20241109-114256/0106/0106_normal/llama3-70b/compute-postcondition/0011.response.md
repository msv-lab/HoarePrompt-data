The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates under the constraint that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k with the condition that a is not equal to b. 

Based on the output, while the specific behavior of the function is not provided, it can be inferred that the function performs some operations based on the aforementioned constraints of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the specified constraints of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, but without any direct input parameters or specific return values detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are integers within the range 1 to 1000, and a and b are integers within the range 1 to n·m·k, ensuring a is not equal to b.**
