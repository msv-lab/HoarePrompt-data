Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment`, which represents the apartment number in a building configuration defined by `m` and `k` (the number of floors and apartments per floor, respectively). It calculates the corresponding block number and floor number for the given apartment and returns these as a tuple. The calculations assume that `apartment` is within the valid range of 1 to `n·m·k`, where `n` is the number of blocks, and both `m` and `k` are positive integers ranging from 1 to 1000. There are no checks for invalid input, such as whether `apartment` is outside the expected range.**
