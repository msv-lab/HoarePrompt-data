To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

### Initial Assessment of the Code

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
   - It determines the blocks and floors for both apartments using `get_location`.
   - It calculates the time to exit the building based on Edward's current floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach Natasha's target floor.
   - The calculations seem to align with the problem statement.

2. **Functionality of `get_location`:**
   - This function computes the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number.
   - The calculations appear to be accurate as they use integer division and modulus to find the correct block and floor.

### Edge Cases

While the code seems to handle the primary logic required by the problem, consider the following edge cases:
- **Single Block Test Case:** If `n=1`, `m=1`, and `k=1`, both apartments `a` and `b` would be apartment number `1`. However, the problem states that `a` and `b` are distinct, so this situation won't occur in the input.
  
- **Maximum Input Values:** If we test the upper limits of the input (`n=1000`, `m=1000`, `k=1000`), it's important to check if the calculations remain valid and do not cause any performance issues or overflow errors.

### Output Hints Analysis

1. **Function 1 Output Description:** 
   - It states that `func_1` calculates the time required to move from apartment `a` to apartment `b` by considering exit time, walking time, and target floor time.
   - This aligns with what the code is attempting to achieve as per the problem description.

2. **Function 2 Output Description:** 
   - It mentions that `get_location` calculates the corresponding block and floor for a given apartment number.
   - This also aligns with the logic implemented in the `get_location` function.

### Conclusion

The provided output descriptions agree with the code logic, and I cannot find any specific cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The calculations for determining the time taken to traverse between apartments and the mechanics of the building's layout seem correctly implemented.

**Correctness:** **True**.

Overall, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
