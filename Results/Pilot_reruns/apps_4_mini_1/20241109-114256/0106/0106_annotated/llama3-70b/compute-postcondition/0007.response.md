To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the existing variables.

1. The code calculates `min_floor_time` based on the formula:
   \[
   min\_floor\_time = (a\_floor - b\_floor) * 5 + 10
   \]

2. We need to identify how `a_floor` and `b_floor` are derived based on the initial state provided:
   - `a_block` is calculated as \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\)
   - `b_floor` is assigned the value \((b - 1) \% m + 1\)
   - `b_block` is assigned the value \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\)
   - `min_block_time` is calculated based on the minimum of the absolute difference and \(n\) minus the absolute difference multiplied by 15.

3. Given that `a_floor` is derived from the calculations involving `a`, `m`, and `k`, and `b_floor` is derived from `b` and `m`, we cannot determine their specific values without knowing `a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, and `n`.

4. However, we can state the impact of the calculation on `min_floor_time`. The value of `min_floor_time` is computed based on `a_floor` and `b_floor`, but since their specific values are unknown, we can only present a general output state.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is calculated based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, multiplied by 5, plus 10.**
