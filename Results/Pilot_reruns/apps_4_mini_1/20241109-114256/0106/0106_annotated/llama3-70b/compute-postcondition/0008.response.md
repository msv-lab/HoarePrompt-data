To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables. However, the initial state lacks the specific values of `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are necessary to compute `min_floor_time`.

The code `min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` uses the values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`. Since these values are unknown, we will denote them in the output state as being dependent on their respective calculations, but we can still express the computation that takes place.

Given that:
- `b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`
- `a_floor` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but can be inferred through the context of `a_block`

Assuming `a_floor` is defined based on the calculations made for `a_block`, we can represent the output state accordingly.

Since we are calculating `min_floor_time` based on the existing values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`, the output will reflect this dependency.

Output State: **`a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is assigned the value (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is assigned the value (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated based on the minimum of the absolute difference and `n` minus the absolute difference multiplied by 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
