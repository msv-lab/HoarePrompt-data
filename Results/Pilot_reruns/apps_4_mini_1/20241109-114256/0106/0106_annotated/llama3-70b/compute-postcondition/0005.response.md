To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet provided. 

1. The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
2. We know that `b` is assigned a value from the previous calculations, specifically `b_floor` is already defined as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, but we do not have the specific values of `b`, `m`, and `k` from the initial state. 
3. However, the calculation for `b_block` will be based on the formula provided.

Given that `b` is the only affected variable here (and it is being used to calculate `b_block`), the output state will reflect the assignment of `b_block` based on the expression provided.

Output State: **`a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is assigned the value (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is assigned the value (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
