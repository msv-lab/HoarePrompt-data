Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between two blocks and floors based on these inputs. The time is computed by first determining the block and floor positions of `a` and `b`, then calculating the time needed to traverse between the blocks and the floors. The function outputs the sum of these two time calculations. It does not handle invalid input cases or potential edge cases where the values of `a` and `b` may not be distinct, which can lead to incorrect assumptions in the calculations. **
