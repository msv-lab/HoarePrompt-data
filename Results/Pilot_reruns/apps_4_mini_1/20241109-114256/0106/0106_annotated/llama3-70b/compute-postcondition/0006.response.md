To calculate the value of `min_block_time`, we first need to analyze the assignments and calculations from the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is assigned the value `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

The expression for `min_block_time` is:
```
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
```

The value of `min_block_time` is determined by the minimum of two values:
1. The absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`: `abs(a_block - b_block)`.
2. The value of `n` minus the absolute difference: `n - abs(a_block - b_block)`.

After the calculation, `min_block_time` is multiplied by `15`.

Assuming the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, and `n` have specific values (which are not given), we arrive at the following output state:

Output State: **`a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is assigned the value (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is assigned the value (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated based on the minimum of the absolute difference and `n` minus the absolute difference multiplied by 15.**
