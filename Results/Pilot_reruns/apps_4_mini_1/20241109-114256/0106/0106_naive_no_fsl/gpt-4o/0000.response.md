To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and check if it adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Location Calculation**:
   - The function `get_location(apartment)` calculates the block ( подъезд ) and floor ( этаж ) corresponding to a given apartment number. This is done by:
     - Finding the block using integer division of the apartment index by `m * k`.
     - Finding the floor by first determining the index within the block and then performing integer division by `k`.
   - This logic appears correct and matches the description.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time it takes for Edward to exit his block. If he is on the first floor, this time is 0; otherwise, it accounts for the elevator wait time (10 seconds) plus the time taken to descend to the first floor (1 second per floor).
   - This part seems correct as well.

3. **Walking Time**:
   - The program calculates the time to walk directly to Natasha's block and the time to walk in the reverse direction. It uses the modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the building.
   - This logic appears to be correct, accounting for both directions.

4. **Time to Target Floor**:
   - The time taken to move to Natasha's floor is correctly calculated based on the difference in floors multiplied by 5 seconds.

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is a sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- A potential problem arises when Edward is on the first floor of his block. The current implementation assumes he will need to use the elevator if he is not on the first floor. However, if he is already on the first floor, the exit time is set to 0, which is correct.
- The calculation for walking time does not account for the scenario where the blocks are the same. If Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors, the walking time should be 0, but the program currently calculates walking time based on the absolute difference in blocks. This would yield a walking time of 0, but would not allow for any floor transition.
- Additionally, the calculation for `min_walk_time` should be adjusted to ensure that the walking time is not calculated if Edward and Natasha are in the same block.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly compute the walking time when both Edward and Natasha are in the same block, which leads to incorrect results. For example, if Edward is in apartment 1 and Natasha is in apartment 2 (both in block 1), the walking time should be 0, but the program will compute it as 15 seconds due to the block walking logic.

Due to these issues, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
