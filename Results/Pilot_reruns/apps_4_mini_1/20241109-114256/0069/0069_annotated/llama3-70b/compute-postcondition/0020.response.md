Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This postcondition accounts for all edge cases, including when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, where division by zero would occur if not properly handled.***
