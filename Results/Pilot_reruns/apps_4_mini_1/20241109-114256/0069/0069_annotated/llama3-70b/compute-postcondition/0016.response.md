The code `print(n + 1)` outputs `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, which affects the output directly. The other variables (`T`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `n` and the result of the operation.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `n + 1`.**
