Postcondition: ***`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is perfectly divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, care must be taken to avoid division by zero; thus, the function should handle this case appropriately, potentially by returning an error or printing a specific message. Otherwise, the function prints the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, representing the necessary adjustments based on the calculated balance.***
