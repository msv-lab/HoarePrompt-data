Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an input integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1, indicating no valid solution. If `cnt0` does not equal `cnt1`, the function prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which provides the number of additional operations required to reach the desired balance. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no outputs are produced.**
