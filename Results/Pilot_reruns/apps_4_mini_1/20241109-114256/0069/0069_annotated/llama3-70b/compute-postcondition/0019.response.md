Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The postcondition holds for all values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and the structure of the string `s`, including edge cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, which may lead to a division by zero if not handled.***
