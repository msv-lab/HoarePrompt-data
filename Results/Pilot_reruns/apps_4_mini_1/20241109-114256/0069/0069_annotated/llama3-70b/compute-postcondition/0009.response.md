Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, and `x - balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which reflects the integer division of the adjusted value by the difference in counts of '0's and '1's, plus one. This handles cases where the counts are equal, resulting in a division by zero, and ensures proper output for any valid input values.***
