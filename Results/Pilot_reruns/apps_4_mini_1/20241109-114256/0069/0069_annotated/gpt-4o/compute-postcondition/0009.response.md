The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `index` is 1, after execution, the value of `index` will be 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `s` is the binary string from `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `s` is the binary string from `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list**.
