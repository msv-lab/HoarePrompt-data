The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects the `results` variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
