The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is the string representation of the integer located at the index `index + 1` in the list `data`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `x` based on the input provided, while `T`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `index`, and `results` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an integer from data[index], `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
