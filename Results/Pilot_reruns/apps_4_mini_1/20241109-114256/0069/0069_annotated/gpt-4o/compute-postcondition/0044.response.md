According to the code, the loop executes over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, ensuring that the range contains at least one valid value for `i`. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is a list initialized with `0` values of length `n + 1`, which is appropriate because it can accommodate the index values from 1 to `n`. At the beginning of the loop, `i` must be set to 1, which is the first value in the defined range.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with `0` values, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
