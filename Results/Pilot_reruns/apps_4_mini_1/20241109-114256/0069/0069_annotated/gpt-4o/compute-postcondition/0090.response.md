Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative. Since `b` is 0, this means `count` is incremented if `x` is non-negative and `(x % balance == 0)`. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
