Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `b` is 0, and if the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the integer division of that difference by `balance` is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
