According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` plus either 1 or -1 depending on `s[2]`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
