According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in `results`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` should be updated to the second element in the list. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
