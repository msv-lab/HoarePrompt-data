The value `-1` is appended to the list `results`. The initial state mentions that `prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances but does not directly affect the `results` list. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index from 1 to n; `results` now contains an additional value of -1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index from 1 to n; `results` now contains an additional value of -1**.
