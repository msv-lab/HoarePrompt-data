Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, initially set to 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If either condition is not met, `count` remains 0. `prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`.***
