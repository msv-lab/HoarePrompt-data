Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the first element is 0, representing the cumulative balance derived from the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. In all scenarios, the integrity of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and the results reflect the conditions checked based on the values of `x` and `balance`.***
