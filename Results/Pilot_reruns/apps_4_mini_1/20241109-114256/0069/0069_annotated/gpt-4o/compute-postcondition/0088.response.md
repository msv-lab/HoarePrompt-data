According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. The loop will iterate over each element in the `prefix_balances` list. Since `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, regardless of the values within the list. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is still 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to account for the initial state of `b` as the first element in `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `count` is 0, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances` (which is 0)**
