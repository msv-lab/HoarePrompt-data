The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The previous state of `results` is not specified, but we know that a new element, `0`, is added to it. The `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` now includes an additional element `0`**
