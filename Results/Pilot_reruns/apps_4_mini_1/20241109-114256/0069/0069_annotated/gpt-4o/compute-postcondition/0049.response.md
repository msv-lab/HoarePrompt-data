The value at `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, we are checking `s[2]`. The value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known, and depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, we either add 1 or subtract 1 from that value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[3]`, but the specific value cannot be determined without knowing the current value of `prefix_balances[2]` or the actual character at `s[2]`.

Since `prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]`, we can summarize the output state as:

Output State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` plus either 1 or -1 depending on `s[2]`, where `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.**
