According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it will remain valid for another iteration as long as `n` is at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]`; `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either 1 or -1.**
