According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the value of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, `n` must also be greater than or equal to 2 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
