Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s` up to the `i`-th character, with `prefix_balances[0]` being 0. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', `prefix_balances[i]` increases by 1; if it's '1', it decreases by 1. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 with only the initial value of 0.**
