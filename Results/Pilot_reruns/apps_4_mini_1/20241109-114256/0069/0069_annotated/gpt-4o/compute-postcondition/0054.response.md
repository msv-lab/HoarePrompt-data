Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the first element is 0, representing the cumulative balance from the string `s`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not found, 0 is appended to `results`. In both cases, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and `results` reflects whether `x` was present or not.***
