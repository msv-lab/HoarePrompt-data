T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), each n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the length of the binary string s, x is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the desired balance, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 100,000.
