The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus `1` if the character `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, or `-1` if it is `'1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the calculation involves the first character of `s`, which is `s[0]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[0]` is `0` (as it is initialized to zeros). 

Thus, `prefix_balances[1]` will be calculated based on whether `s[0]` is `'0'` or `'1'`. If `s[0]` is `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

Since the exact value of `s[0]` is not provided, the output state can only specify the possible outcomes based on the character `s[0]`. Therefore, the output state is: 

`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`, which can lead to either `prefix_balances[1]` being `1` if `s[0]` is `'0'` or `-1` if `s[0]` is `'1'`. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`, leading to `prefix_balances[1]` being either 1 (if `s[0]` is '0') or -1 (if `s[0]` is '1')**
