According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of `T` iterations. The loop variable `_` typically does not affect the state needed for the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over `T`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop counter, which reflects the next iteration. If we assume `T` is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute one more time if `T` is greater than the current iteration count.

Given that we are at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state to indicate that we are now preparing for the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index `i` contains the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s` up to index `i - 1`, `results` includes the current value of `count`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count**
