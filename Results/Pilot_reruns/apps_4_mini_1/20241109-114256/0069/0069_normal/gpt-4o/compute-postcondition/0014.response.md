According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n + 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently the last value it took before the loop ended, which would be `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 2`. 

Additionally, the state of `prefix_balances` depends on the specific value of `s[1]`, which will influence the value of `prefix_balances[2]`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can run one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `n + 2` and consider `prefix_balances` updated based on `s[1]`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[1]`, `i` is n + 2**
