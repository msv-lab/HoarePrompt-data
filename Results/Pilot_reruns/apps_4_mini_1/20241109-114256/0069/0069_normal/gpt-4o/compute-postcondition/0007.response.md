The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 1, the expression `index + 1` evaluates to 2. Thus, `x` takes the value of `int(data[2])`, which converts the element at position 2 of the `data` list into an integer. The value of `n` is not directly affected, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer conversion of `data[1]`, and `x` is the integer conversion of `data[2]**
