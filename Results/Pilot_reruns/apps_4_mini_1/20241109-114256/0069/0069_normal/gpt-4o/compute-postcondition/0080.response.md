According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to 3 for the next iteration. 

The list `prefix_balances` has a length of `n + 1`, and it is initialized with 0s. There are no other states that need to be adjusted since the loop body does not modify `n`, and we have sufficient information about `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**
