Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `balance` is 0, the second condition `(x - b) // balance >= 0` may result in a division by zero error, which is not handled in the loop. Therefore, if `balance` is 0, special handling is required to avoid an error.**
