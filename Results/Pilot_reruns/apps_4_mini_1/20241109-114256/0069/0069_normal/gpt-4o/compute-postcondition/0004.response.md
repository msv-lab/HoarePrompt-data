The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. Other variables such as `data`, `T`, and `index` remain unchanged since they are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from input split by whitespace, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from input split by whitespace, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**
