Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'; the variable `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read`, which reads input from standard input.**
