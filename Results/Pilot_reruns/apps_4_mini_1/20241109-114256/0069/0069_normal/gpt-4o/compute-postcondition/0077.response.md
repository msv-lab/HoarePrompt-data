The code assigns a value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and a conditional expression that checks the character `s[i - 1]`. Since `s` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state will show the relationship between `prefix_balances[i]`, `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, and the conditional expression without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
