According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` contains at least one value, the loop will execute. Since it is stated that after the loop executes T times, `results` contains values, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty before the loop starts. 

To allow the loop to execute, we need to make sure that `results` contains at least one element, which means `T` must be greater than 0 and that there have been successful evaluations that led to values being appended to `results` during the previous evaluations based on the conditions provided.

Additionally, it is necessary to confirm that `T` is greater than 0 to ensure the loop will have iterations. 

Hence, we adjust the states as follows:
- `results` must contain at least one value (indicating that the loop has executed at least once).
- `T` must be greater than 0 (indicating that the loop can execute).

State: **`results` contains at least one value, `T` is greater than 0**
