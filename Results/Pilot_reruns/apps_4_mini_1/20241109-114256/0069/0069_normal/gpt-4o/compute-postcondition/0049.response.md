The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, we are looking at `prefix_balances[2]`. The update involves adding 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise subtracting 1.

The previous value of `prefix_balances[2]` will be affected, and `prefix_balances[1]` is used for this calculation. The variable `n` being greater than or equal to 3 indicates that there are sufficient elements in `prefix_balances` and `s` to perform this operation.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` at index 3 is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3**.
