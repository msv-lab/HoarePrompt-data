Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 1, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1 appended to it. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains 0 appended to it. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to 0s, and `results` contains 0 appended to it.***
