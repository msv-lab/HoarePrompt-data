The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`data`, `T`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `s`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer conversion of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer conversion of `data[2]`, and `s` is `data[3]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer conversion of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer conversion of `data[2]`, and `s` is `data[3]`**
