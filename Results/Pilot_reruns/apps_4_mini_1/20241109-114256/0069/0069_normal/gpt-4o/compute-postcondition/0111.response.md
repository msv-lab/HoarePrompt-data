The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the definition. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that `func_1` operates on a series of test cases defined by the constraints provided. 

The expected output based on the constraints is as follows:

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- `x` is an integer that can take values between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

Since the output is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we can summarize that the function processes these test cases but does not return a specific result in the traditional sense. 

Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases defined by T, where each test case consists of a positive integer n, an integer x, and a binary string s of length n.**
