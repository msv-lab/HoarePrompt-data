Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative counts based on `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` reflecting the balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` will have -1 appended to it. Otherwise, `results` will be appended with 0. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains [0] and `results` will either be appended with -1 or 0, depending on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`.***
