Output State: **if `n` is at least 1 then `prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums where each entry `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated based on the preceding value and the character `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to 0s.**
