According to the loop structure, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. 

Thus, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to indicate that it is now greater than or equal to 2, since `n` was previously only known to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 1 based on the value of `s[0]`; `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
