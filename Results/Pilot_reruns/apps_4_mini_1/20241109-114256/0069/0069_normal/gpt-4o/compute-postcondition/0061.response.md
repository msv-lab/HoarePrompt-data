Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains 1. In all cases, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`.***
