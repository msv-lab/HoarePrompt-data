The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, we are looking at the elements in `s` and determining whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not. The value will increment by 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', otherwise, it will decrement by 1. The exact impact on `prefix_balances[i]` depends on the value of `s[i - 1]` which is not specified, but it will be modified accordingly. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the change.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, which influences `prefix_balances[i]` to be either `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` or `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`.**
