According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, which means it can execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 2`. This indicates that the loop has already executed for all valid `i` values (from `1` to `n + 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `n + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `prefix_balances` does not require modification for the loop to execute again in this context.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[1]`, `i` is n + 1**
