Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1. `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `b` is the second element in the list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being either 1 or 2. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged (0 or 1).***
