To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information.

1. The loop iterates `T` times, which means the variable `_` is used to track the number of iterations. 
2. The loop can continue executing as long as the current iteration count is less than `T`. 
3. The state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the specific value of `_`, but it implies that the loop has already executed some number of times.

Given that the loop is controlled by `T`, for the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `_` must be less than `T`. Since the exact value of `_` is not provided, we can say that it must be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, we can conclude:
- If the loop has executed `k` times (where `k` is less than `T`), then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `k` (which is currently the value of `_` at the end of the last iteration).
- Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time by adjusting the relevant state for `_`.

State: **`_` is less than T**
