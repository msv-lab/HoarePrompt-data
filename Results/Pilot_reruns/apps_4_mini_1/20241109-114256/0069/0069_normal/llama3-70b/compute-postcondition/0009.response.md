Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, where it's important to note that this calculation is valid only if `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the precondition does not guarantee a defined behavior for the else case.***
