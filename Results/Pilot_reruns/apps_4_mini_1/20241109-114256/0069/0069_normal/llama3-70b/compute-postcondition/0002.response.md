The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the output of `input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The values of `T` and `_` are not directly affected by this operation. The outcome depends on the input provided. Since the input is unspecified, `n` and `x` will take on values derived from the input. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `x` are input integers.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `x` are input integers**
