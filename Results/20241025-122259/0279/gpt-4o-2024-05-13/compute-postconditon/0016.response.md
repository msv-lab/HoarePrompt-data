Example Answer:
The total_distance is calculated by summing all the elements in the list `speeds`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `speeds`, and `i` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values according to the loop logic, and `i` is equal to `t`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values according to the loop logic, and `i` is equal to `t`**
