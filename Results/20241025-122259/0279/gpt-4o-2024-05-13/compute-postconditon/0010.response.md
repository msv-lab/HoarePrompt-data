Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values, and `i` is increased by 1**
