Example Answer: 
A list named `speeds` is created with `t` number of elements, each initialized to 0. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements, all initialized to 0.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements, all initialized to 0**
