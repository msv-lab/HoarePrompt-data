Example Answer: 
The values from input are split and converted to integers, and assigned to `t` and `d`. The initial values of `v1` and `v2` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input**
