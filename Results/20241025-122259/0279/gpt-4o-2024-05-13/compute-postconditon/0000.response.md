Example Answer: 
`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `v1` and `v2` can range from 1 to 100. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are not affected.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are not affected**
