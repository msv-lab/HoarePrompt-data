Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `i` is 1, the new value of `i` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the updated value at index i, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the updated value at index i, and `i` is 2**
