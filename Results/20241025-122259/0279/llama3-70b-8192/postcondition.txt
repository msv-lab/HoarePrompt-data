`v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` have assigned values from the input splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the value that caused the `StopIteration`
