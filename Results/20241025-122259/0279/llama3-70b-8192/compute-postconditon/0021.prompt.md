You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for summarizing the state of the function after executing a Python `try` statement. You will be provided with the final state of the program after executing the `try` block, and the changes in the program after executing one or more `except` blocks in any situation. Please combine this information to summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement. If there is a return always include it in the output sate. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:
Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
```
result = a / b
return result
```
Program state after the execution of the `try` statement: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `result` is the result of `a` divided by `b`, and the function returns `result`.


Changes in the program state after executing the `except` block :
Initial State: variables can hold any values.
```
return None
```
Program state after executing the except statement(s) : Except statement 1:The function return None.


Below is the initial program state and the complete `try` statement:
Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
```
try:
    result = a / b
    return result
except ZeroDivisionError:
    return None
```
Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? What is the program's state after the `try` statement is executed?


Example Answer:
A `ZeroDivisionError` might be triggered at `result = a / b`. If `b` is 0, the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.**

Example 2:

Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.
```
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        print("File content successfully read.")
        return data
```
Program state after the execution of the `try` statement: `file_path` is a string thats supposed to be a path to a file, data is the contents of that file and the function returns that content.


Changes in the program state after executing the `except` block :
Initial State: variables can hold any values.
```
Except 1:
    print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
    return None

Except 2:
    print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
    return None
```
Program state after executing the except statement(s) : Except statement 1:The function return None and prints "Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path." 
                                                        Except statement 2: The function return None and prints "Error: You do not have permission to read this file."

                                                        
Below is the initial program state and the complete `try` statement:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.


```
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read.")
            return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
        return None
```

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? What is the program's state after the `try` statement is executed?


Example Answer:
The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found at the specified path or a `PermissionError` if the user does not have permission to read the file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function reads the file content and returns it. Therefore: Output State: **file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function returns the file content, otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.**


Your Task:
Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`
```
i = next(iter_i)

max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)

min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)

max_length += max_speed

min_length += min_speed

```
Program state after the execution of the `try` statement: `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the next value from the iterator `iter_i`; `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation; `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.


Changes in the program state after executing the `except` block in any case:
Initial State: variables can hold any values.
```
Except 1:
break

```

Program state after executing the except statement(s) : except_1: unknown
Below is the initial program state and the complete `try` statement:

```
try:
    i = next(iter_i)
    max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
    min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
    max_length += max_speed
    min_length += min_speed
except StopIteration:
    break

```
Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? What is the program's state after the `try` statement is executed?
