Example Answer:
`max_speed` is assigned the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`. Since `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100, `max_speed` will be the maximum of those values. Therefore, the Output State is: v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2**
