Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until a `StopIteration` exception occurs. Therefore, all states should be repeated as they are at the end of the previous iteration to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`**
