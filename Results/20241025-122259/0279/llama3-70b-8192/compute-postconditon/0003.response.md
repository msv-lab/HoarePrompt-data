Example Answer:
min_speed is assigned the minimum value of v1 and v2. Since v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100, min_speed will be between 1 and 100. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2; min_speed is between 1 and 100.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2; min_speed is between 1 and 100**
