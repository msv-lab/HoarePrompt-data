Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is assigned the next element from the iterator `iter_i`. The previous values of variables are not provided, so the output state is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t**
