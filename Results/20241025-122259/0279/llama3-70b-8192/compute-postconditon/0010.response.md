Example Answer:
max_length is incremented by the value of max_speed. The previous value of max_length is between t and 100t, and max_speed is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the new max_length will be between t+1 and 100t+100.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is between 1 and 100; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t+1 and 100t+100; min_length is between t and 100t**
