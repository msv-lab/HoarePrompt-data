Example Answer:
max_length is assigned the value of max_speed * t. Since max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2, and v1 and v2 are integers between 1 and 100, the maximum speed is also between 1 and 100. Therefore, max_length will be between 1 * t and 100 * t. 
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t**
