Example Answer:
`a1` is assigned the value of the first element of `data` converted to an integer, and `b1` is assigned the value of the second element of `data` converted to an integer. The previous values of `input` and `data` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`**
