Example Answer:
`w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned the values obtained from the `next(iterator)` function. The values of `w2, h2, w3, h3` depend on the next value returned by the `iterator`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with different combinations of `a2, b2, a3, b3`; `w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned values based on the next value returned by the `iterator`.
Output State: **`a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with different combinations of `a2, b2, a3, b3`; `w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned values based on the next value returned by the `iterator`**
