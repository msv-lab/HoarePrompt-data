A `StopIteration` exception could be triggered at `w2, h2, w3, h3 = next(iterator)` if there are no more items to iterate through. If such an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables do not change. The function does not return any value in this case.

Therefore, the output state is: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables do not change.**
