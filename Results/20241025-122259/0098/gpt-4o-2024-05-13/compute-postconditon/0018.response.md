A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `w2, h2, w3, h3 = next(iterator)` if there are no more elements to iterate over in the iterator. In this case, the program will break out of the loop. The state after the `try` statement is executed is unknown as the `except` block only contains a `break` statement without any further information on the program state.
Output State: **Unknown**
