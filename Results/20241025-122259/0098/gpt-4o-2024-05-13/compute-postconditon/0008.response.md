Example Answer:
`w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the iterator. The values of `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are determined by the next tuple in the iterator. Therefore, the Output State is: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3, and `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the iterator.
Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3, and `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the iterator**
