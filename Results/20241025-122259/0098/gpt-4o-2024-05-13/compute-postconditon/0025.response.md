Example Answer:
The variable `data` is assigned the value of the input split by spaces. Since the `input` function is now assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, the `input().split()` function will read input from the standard input and split it based on spaces. Therefore, the output state is `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces**
