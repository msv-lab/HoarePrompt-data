A `StopIteration` exception could occur when there are no more items to iterate over in the iterator. After the `try` statement is executed, `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with different combinations of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, and `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the iterator. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, the function returns 'YES'.
