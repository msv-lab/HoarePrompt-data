Example Answer:
The iterator is assigned the iterator object created from the list of possible_orientations. The values of a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3.
Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3**
