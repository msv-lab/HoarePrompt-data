Example Answer:
`a2` and `b2` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `a2` and `b2` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers**
