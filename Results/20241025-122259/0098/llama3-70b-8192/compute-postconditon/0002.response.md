Example Answer:
`a3` and `b3` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts an input and splits it into a list of strings, `map(int, ...)` then converts each element of the list to an integer. The initial values of `a1` and `b1` are not affected, but `a2` and `b2` are replaced by the input integers. 
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers**
