Postcondition: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
