Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within specified ranges, `x` and `s` are input integers, `b` is a list of integers from input, `c` is a list of integers created from input, `d` is a list of integers from user input, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `a`. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without updating any variables.**
