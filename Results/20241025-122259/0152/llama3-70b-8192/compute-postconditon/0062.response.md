Example Answer:
The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is 0**
