Example Answer:
`x` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts input and splits it based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts the split values to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers**
