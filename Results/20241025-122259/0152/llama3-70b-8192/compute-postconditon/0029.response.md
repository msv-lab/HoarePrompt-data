Example Answer:
If `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`. If `j` is equal to -1, `cnt` retains its initial value of 0. The expression `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t` is calculated and compared with the current value of `ans`. The minimum value between `ans` and the calculated expression is assigned back to `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison**
