Example Answer:
The value of `s_left` is assigned as the result of `s - b[i]`. The value of `s` is unchanged, and the value of `b[i]` is also unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5**
