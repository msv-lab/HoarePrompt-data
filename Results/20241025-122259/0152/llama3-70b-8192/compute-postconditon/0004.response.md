Example Answer:
The list `c` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `c` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `c` is a list of integers created from the input**
