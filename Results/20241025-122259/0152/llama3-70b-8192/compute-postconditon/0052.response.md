Your Task:
Precondition: `num1` and `num2` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if num1 > num2:
    result = num1
else:
    result = num2

```
Postcondition for if body: If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `result` is assigned the value of `num1`
Postcondition for else body: If `num1` is not greater than `num2`, then `result` is assigned the value of `num2`
Postcondition: **`num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, `result` is assigned the value of `num1`. Otherwise, `result` is assigned the value of `num2`.**
