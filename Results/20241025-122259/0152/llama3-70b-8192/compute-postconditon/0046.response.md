Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` is increased by 1, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j+1]`, `ans` is updated based on comparison, `i` is -1, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `s_left` is `s - b[i+1] - d[j+1] - d[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j+1]`, `ans` is updated based on comparison, `i` is -1, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `s_left` is `s - b[i+1] - d[j+1] - d[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j+1]`, `ans` is updated based on comparison, `i` is -1, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `s_left` is `s - b[i+1] - d[j+1] - d[j]`**
