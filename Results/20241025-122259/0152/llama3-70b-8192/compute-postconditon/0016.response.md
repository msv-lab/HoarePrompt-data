Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ans`, `i`, `t`, `j` are integers within specified ranges; `t` is assigned a value based on conditions; if `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`, otherwise `t` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `a`; if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without updating any variables; `j` is assigned 1; `s_left` is decreased by the value of `d[j]`.**
