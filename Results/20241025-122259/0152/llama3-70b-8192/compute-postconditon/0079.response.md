According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` could be negated based on the conditions. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be negated. Additionally, `j` needs to be increased by 1, `s_left` should be updated accordingly, `cnt` may need to be updated based on the loop iteration, and `ans` could be updated based on the minimum expression. No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is negated, `j` is increased by 1, `s_left` is updated accordingly, `cnt` may be updated, `ans` could be updated based on the minimum expression**
