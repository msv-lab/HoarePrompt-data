According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `k`, `s_left`, and `d[j]`. If `j` is less than `k` and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ans`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- `j` is 1.
- `s_left` has been decreased by the value of `d[j]`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `j` by 1.
- Decrease `s_left` by the value of `d[j]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ans`, `i`, `t` remain the same; `j` is incremented by 1; `s_left` is further decreased by the value of `d[j]`.**
