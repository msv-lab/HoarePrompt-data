According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `j` is less than `k` and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is 4**
