Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates over all possible combinations of using spells of the first type and second type to find the minimum time required to prepare n potions. It calculates the time taken for each combination and updates the answer accordingly. The logic aligns with the problem description of considering the time required for each spell, available mana points, and the number of potions that can be instantly created. The program handles the cases where a spell cannot be used due to insufficient mana points and correctly determines the minimum time required.
