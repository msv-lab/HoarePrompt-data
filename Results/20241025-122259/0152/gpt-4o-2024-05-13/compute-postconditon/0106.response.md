Your task is to complete the postconditions for the following program fragment:

Precondition: `num` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if num % 2 == 0:
    num = num // 2
else:
    num = 3 * num + 1
```

Postcondition for if body: If `num` is divisible by 2, `num` is updated to `num` divided by 2.
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is not divisible by 2, `num` is updated to 3 times `num` plus 1.
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer. If `num` is divisible by 2, then `num` is updated to `num` divided by 2. Otherwise, `num` is updated to 3 times `num` plus 1.**
