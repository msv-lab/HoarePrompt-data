Example Answer:
`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is now the same as `k`. The `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `c[j]`, and `a[i]`. 
Output State: **No changes to the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, or `remaining_manapoints`. `j` is assigned the value of `k`. `min_time` is updated with the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and the calculated `time_with_both_spells`.**
