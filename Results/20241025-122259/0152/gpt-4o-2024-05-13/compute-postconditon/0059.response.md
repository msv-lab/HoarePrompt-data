Postcondition: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is set to the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`. If `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, the loop is terminated.**
