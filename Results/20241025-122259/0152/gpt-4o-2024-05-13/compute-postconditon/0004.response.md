Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `time_with_spell`. The values of `min_time`, `i`, `remaining_potions`, and `time_with_spell` are affected. 
Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`; `i` is assigned the value of `k`; `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`; `time_with_spell` is the result of `remaining_potions * x`**
