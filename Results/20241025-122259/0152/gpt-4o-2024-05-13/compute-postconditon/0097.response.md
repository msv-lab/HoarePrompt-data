Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. The values of `min_time`, `time_with_both_spells`, `j`, `k`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `k`, `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the aforementioned values, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum value.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `k`, `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the aforementioned values, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum value**
