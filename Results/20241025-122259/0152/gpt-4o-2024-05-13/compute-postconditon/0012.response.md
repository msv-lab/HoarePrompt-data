Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within a valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k + 1` less than 0, and if `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum value between the current `min_time` and `remaining_potions * x`, where `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`.**
