Example Answer:
`time_with_spell` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * x`, where `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: 
`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`, and `time_with_spell` is the result of `remaining_potions * x`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`, and `time_with_spell` is the result of `remaining_potions * x`**
