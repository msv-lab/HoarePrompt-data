According to the code, the loop condition is `j < 0`, which indicates that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 0. Since `j` needs to be increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be: `num` is either updated based on the conditions described above and `j` is less than or equal to 1.
State: **`num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, and `j` is less than or equal to 1**
