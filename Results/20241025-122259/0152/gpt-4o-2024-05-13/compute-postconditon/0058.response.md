Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
