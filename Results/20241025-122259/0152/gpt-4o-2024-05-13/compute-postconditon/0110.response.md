Example Answer:
`time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, where `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The value of `remaining_potions` depends on the values of `n` and `c[j]`, while `a[i]` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, `j` is less than or equal to 1, `remaining_potions` is calculated based on `n` and `c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`.
Output State: **`num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, `j` is less than or equal to 1, `remaining_potions` is calculated based on `n` and `c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`**
