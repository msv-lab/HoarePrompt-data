Your task:

Precondition: `x` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if x % 2 == 0:
    x += 1
elif x % 3 == 0:
    x -= 1
else:
    x *= 2
```

Postcondition for if body: If `x` is divisible by 2, `x` is incremented by 1.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is not divisible by 2 but divisible by 3, `x` is decremented by 1. If `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3, `x` is multiplied by 2.
Postcondition: **`x` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by 2, then `x` is increased by 1. If `x` is not divisible by 2 but divisible by 3, `x` is decreased by 1. If `x` is not divisible by 2 or 3, `x` is doubled.**
