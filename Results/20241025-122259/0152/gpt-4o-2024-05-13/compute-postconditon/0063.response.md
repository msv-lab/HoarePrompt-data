Postcondition: **If `i` is initially less than 0, `min_time` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented until it becomes greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is initially greater than or equal to 0, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `n * a[i]`, and `i` is incremented until it exceeds the length of array `b`.**
