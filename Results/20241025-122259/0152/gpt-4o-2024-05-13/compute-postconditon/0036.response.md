According to the code, the loop can execute only if `i` is less than 0 which is not possible. Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time and no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `n * a[i]`**
