Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of the 4th element of `data` converted to an integer. The previous values of the variables are `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, and `k` is an integer value. After execution, `x` now holds the integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, and `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, and `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`**
