According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` is less than 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to a value greater than or equal to 0.
State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is greater than or equal to 0.**
