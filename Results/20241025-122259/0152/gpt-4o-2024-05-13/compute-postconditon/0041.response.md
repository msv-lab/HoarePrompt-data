Example Answer: 
`remaining_potions` is assigned the value of `max(0, n - c[j])`, where `n` and `c[j]` are known values. If `n - c[j]` is greater than 0, `remaining_potions` will be equal to `n - c[j]`, otherwise, it will be 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes to the variables `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, or `remaining_manapoints`. `j` is assigned the value of `k`. `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `c[j]`.
