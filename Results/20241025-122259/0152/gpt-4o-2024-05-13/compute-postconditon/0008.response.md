Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[i]`. The value of `n` is unknown, `c[i]` is unknown, and `i` is `k + 1` less than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time` is the result of `n * x` within a valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1 less than 0, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within a valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1 less than 0, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`**
