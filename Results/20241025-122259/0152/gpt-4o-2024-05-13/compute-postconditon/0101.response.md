According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables remain the same and `j` is now equal to `k + 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 0. Since `j` is now equal to `k + 1`, `k` must be less than -1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is now equal to `k + 1` and `k` is less than -1**
