Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The values of `n` and `c[j]` are integers, so the result of `n - c[j]` can be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers, `remaining_potions` is an integer calculated based on the values of `n` and `c[j]`.
Output State: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers, `remaining_potions` is an integer calculated based on the values of `n` and `c[j]`**
