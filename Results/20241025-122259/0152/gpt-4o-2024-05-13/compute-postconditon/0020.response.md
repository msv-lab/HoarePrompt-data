Output State: **If `i` is already less than 0 initially, the loop will not be executed. In this case, `min_time` remains the result of `n * x` within a valid range, and `i` remains as `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0 initially, the loop will be executed at least once. After 1 iteration, `min_time` is updated according to the conditions, `i` is incremented to `k + 1`.**
