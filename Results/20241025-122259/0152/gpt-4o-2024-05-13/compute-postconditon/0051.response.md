Output State: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers. `d` is a list of integers. `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is computed as the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is less than 0.**
