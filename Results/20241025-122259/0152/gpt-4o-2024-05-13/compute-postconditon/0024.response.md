Postcondition: **`i` is assigned the value of `m`, where `m` is a variable. If `i` is initially less than 0, `min_time` remains the same. Otherwise, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `n * a[i]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop is executed at least once.**
