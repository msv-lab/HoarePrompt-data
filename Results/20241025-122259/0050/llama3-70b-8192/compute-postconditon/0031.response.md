Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `r`, `shares`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. If `shares` is greater than 0, the program will update `r` and reset `shares` to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program will break out of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is incremented by 1**
