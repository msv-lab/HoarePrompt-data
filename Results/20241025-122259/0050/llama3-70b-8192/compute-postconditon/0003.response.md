Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, b is a list of integers based on input.
Output State: **n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, b is a list of integers based on input**
