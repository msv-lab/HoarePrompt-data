According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `s[i]`, and `i`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop condition `i < 0` is not satisfied, so `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is less than 0**
