Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous value of `r` and `s[i]` is unknown, so the output state is: `shares` remains the same, `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.
Output State: **`shares` remains the same, `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]**.
