Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of the list `b` are unknown. After sorting in reverse order, the list `b` is now arranged in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, and b is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, and b is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
