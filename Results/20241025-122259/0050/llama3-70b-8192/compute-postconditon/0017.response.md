Output State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated to the quotient of `r` divided by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop will never execute. `i` is increased by 1.**
