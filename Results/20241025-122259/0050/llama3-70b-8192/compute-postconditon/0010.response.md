Precondition: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `shares` is 0, and `i` is equal to `n`
Program fragment:
```
if r >= s[i]:
    shares += r // s[i]
    r %= s[i]
else:
    break
```
Postcondition for if body: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `shares` is updated based on the division result of `r` by `s[i]`
Postcondition for else body: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.
Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `shares` is updated based on the division result of `r` by `s[i]` if r is greater than or equal to s[i]. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.**
