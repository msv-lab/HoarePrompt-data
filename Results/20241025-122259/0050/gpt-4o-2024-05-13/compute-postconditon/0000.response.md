Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `r`. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= s_i <= 1000. b is a list of m positive integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 1000.**
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= s_i <= 1000. b is a list of m positive integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 1000.**
