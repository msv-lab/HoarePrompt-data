Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`**
