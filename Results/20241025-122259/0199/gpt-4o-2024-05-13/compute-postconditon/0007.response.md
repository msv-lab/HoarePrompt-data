Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `n`, so `i` now holds the number of kegs. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume, and `i` is an integer representing the number of kegs.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume, and `i` is an integer representing the number of kegs**
