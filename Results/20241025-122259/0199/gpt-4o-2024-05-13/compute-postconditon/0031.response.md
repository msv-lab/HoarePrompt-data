According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is already less than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` remain the same as integers**
