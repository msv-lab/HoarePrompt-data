According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer. To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers**
