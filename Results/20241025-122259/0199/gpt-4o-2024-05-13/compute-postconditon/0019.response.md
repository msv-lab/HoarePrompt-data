Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers. If volumes[i] is less than or equal to min_keg_volume, the loop continues without any changes. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is calculated as the minimum of volumes[i] - min_keg_volume and remaining_kvass, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**
