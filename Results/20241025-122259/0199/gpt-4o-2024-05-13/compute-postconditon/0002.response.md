Example Answer:
The list `volumes` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume**
