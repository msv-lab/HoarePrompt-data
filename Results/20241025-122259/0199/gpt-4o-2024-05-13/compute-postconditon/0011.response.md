Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers. If the volume at index `i` in the list volumes is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is assigned the minimum value between (volumes[i] - min_keg_volume) and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is updated by subtracting `possible_to_take`.**
