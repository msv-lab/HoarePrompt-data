Example Answer:
The variable `possible_to_take` is assigned the minimum value between the difference of the volume of the current keg `volumes[i]` and the volume of the first keg `min_keg_volume`, and the remaining kvass `remaining_kvass`. Therefore, the `possible_to_take` will be the minimum value between the two. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume, `i` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `possible_to_take` is the minimum value between (volumes[i] - min_keg_volume) and remaining_kvass**
