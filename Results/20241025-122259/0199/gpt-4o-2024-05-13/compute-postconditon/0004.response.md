Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(-1)` simply prints the value -1 to the console. It does not affect the initial state variables `n`, `s`, or `total_volume`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list**
