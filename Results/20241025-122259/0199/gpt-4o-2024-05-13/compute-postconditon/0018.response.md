Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by the value of `possible_to_take`. The previous values of `remaining_kvass` and `possible_to_take` are known integers. Therefore, the new value of `remaining_kvass` is the previous value of `remaining_kvass` minus the previous value of `possible_to_take`. 
Output State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers, `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`**
