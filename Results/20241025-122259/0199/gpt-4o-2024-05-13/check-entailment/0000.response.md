Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of the number of kegs `n`, glass volume `s`, and the volumes of each keg.
2. It then sorts the volumes in ascending order to make it easier to distribute the kvass later.
3. It calculates the total volume of all kegs and checks if it is less than the glass volume. If it is, the program correctly prints -1.
4. If there is enough kvass to pour `s` liters, the program proceeds to calculate the maximum possible volume in the least filled keg.
5. By distributing the remaining kvass to make each keg as even as possible, the program correctly determines the final volume in the least filled keg.
6. The program then prints the minimum keg volume which is the correct answer based on the problem description. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
