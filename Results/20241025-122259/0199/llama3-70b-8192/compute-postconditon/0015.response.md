According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` are integers from the adjustments described above. If the sum `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. So in order for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- If `total` is less than `s`, update `low` to `mid`.
- If `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, update `high` to `mid - 1`.

State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` are integers from the adjustments described above based on the condition of `total` being less than or greater than `s`.**
