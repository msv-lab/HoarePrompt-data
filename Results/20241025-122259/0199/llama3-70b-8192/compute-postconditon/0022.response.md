Output State: **If the initial `low` is equal to `high`, then the loop will not execute. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop will execute a variable number of times based on the conditions met. After the loop, `low` and `high` will be the same if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise, they will differ by 1.**
