According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `low`, `high`, and `mid` are integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` should be updated to `mid`.
- If `total` is not less than `s`, then `low` remains the same, `high` should be updated to `mid - 1`.

State: **`low`, `high`, `mid` are integers after the adjustments described above.**
