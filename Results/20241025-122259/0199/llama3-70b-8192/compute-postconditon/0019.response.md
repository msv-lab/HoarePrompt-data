Example Answer: 
`high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous values of `mid` are not given, so the output state is: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` are integers from the adjustments described above based on the condition of `total` being less than or greater than `s`.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` are integers from the adjustments described above based on the condition of `total` being less than or greater than `s`**
