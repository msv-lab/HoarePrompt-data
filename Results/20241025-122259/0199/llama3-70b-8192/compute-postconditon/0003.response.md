Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value `0`, and `high` is assigned the minimum value in list `v`. Since `v` is sorted in ascending order, the minimum value of `v` is the first element. Therefore, after execution, `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum value in list `v`.
Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in list `v`**
