Example Answer:
The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `v` are rearranged to be in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `v` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `v` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
