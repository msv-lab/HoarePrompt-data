Example Answer:
The `wait_time` variable is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `t` is unknown. As `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, the output state will be: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula**
