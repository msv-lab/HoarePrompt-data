Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value `int(data[1])`, where `data[1]` represents the second element in the list `data`. The initial state mentions that `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `data`, but the value of `n` is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `data`, `t` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `data`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `data`, `t` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `data`**
