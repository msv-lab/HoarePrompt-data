Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop execution, `min_wait_time` will hold the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` will be the route index with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, `chosen_route` will remain -1.**
