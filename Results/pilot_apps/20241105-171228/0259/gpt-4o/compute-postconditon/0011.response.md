Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s_i` is greater or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if statement, if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the calculation and update of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the conditions specified.***
