Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is unknown, and `t` is unknown. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `s_i` and `t`, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
