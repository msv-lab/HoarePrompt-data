According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `n` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `min_wait_time` is a positive number representing the minimum wait time.
- `chosen_route` is either -1 or an integer from 1 to the number of bus routes.
- `n`, `i` are positive integers.
- `s_i`, `d_i` hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Update `n` to be greater than the current value of `n`.
- Update `i` to be incremented by 1.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive number representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is either -1 or an integer from 1 to the number of bus routes. `n+1`, `i+1` are positive integers. `s_i`, `d_i` hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`.**
