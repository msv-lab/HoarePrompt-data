Example Answer: 
The `input()` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list `data`. The variables `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains the same after the execution of this code snippet.
Output State: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`.**
