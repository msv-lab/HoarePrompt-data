Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0**
