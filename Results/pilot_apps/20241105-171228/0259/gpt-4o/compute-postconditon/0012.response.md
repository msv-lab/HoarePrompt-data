According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
