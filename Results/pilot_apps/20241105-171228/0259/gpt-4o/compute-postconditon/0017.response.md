Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`. If the condition (t - s_i) % d_i == 0 is true, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block, ensuring that the variables maintain their initial values and relationships.***
