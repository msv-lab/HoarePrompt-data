Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. Since `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, it remains positive infinity. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
