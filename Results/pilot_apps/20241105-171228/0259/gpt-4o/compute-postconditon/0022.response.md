According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` retain their assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` retain their assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`**
