Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The program handles all edge cases, ensuring that the program correctly determines `wait_time` based on the conditions provided.***
