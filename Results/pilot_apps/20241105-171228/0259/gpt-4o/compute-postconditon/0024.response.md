Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the result of subtracting the value of `t` from the value of `s_i`. The initial state shows that `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`. Since the provided information does not include the value of `t`, the output state will be based on the calculated expression only.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the result of `s_i - t`**
