Example Answer:
The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `t` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `time` cannot be determined. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1 or -1, `buses` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `s` is the first value of the second element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the second element in `buses`**
