Example Answer:
The tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from user input. The initial state does not provide information on the current state of `buses`, so we cannot determine the exact output state of `buses`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, and the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, and the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`**
