According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0. Since `t` is not used within the loop, it does not affect the execution of the loop. So, the adjusted state before the loop starts would be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5**
