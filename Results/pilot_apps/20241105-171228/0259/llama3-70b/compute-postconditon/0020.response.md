According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is another element in the `buses` list. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1 or -1, `buses` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` is the first value of the first element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the first element in `buses`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `buses` should have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.
- Update `i` to 1 to move to the next element in the `buses` list.
- Update `s` and `d` to be the first and second values of the second element in the `buses` list respectively.

State: **`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1 or -1, `buses` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `s` is the first value of the second element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the second element in `buses`**
