Example Answer:
The tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are user inputs, and the list `buses` now contains this new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are user input values, the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`, `_` is within the range of `n+2`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are user input values, the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`, `_` is within the range of `n+2`**
