Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`. `ans` is either 1 if the time is less than the current minimum time or -1 if the time is not less than the current minimum time. `buses` is a list with at least 1 element. `i` is 0, `s` is the first value of the first element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the first element in `buses`.***
