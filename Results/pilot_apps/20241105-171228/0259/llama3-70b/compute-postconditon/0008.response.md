According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is within the range of `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `s` and `d` are user input values, the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`, and `_` is within the range of `n+1`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `_` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of `n+2`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are user input values, the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`, `_` is within the range of `n+2`**
