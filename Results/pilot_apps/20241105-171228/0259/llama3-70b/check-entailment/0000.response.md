Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the time for each bus route based on the given formula, and then determines the bus route Serval will use by finding the minimum time. The output will be the bus route that minimizes the waiting time for Serval. The output hints also align with the code logic, and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
