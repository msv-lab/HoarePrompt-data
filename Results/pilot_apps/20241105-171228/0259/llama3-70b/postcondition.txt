`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the iteration, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the current iteration index, `s` is the first value of the current element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the current element in `buses`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `min_time` remains positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1. `print(ans)` is executed.
