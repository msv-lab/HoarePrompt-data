Example Answer:
The list `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing tens values. The previous state of `s` and `ones` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine**
