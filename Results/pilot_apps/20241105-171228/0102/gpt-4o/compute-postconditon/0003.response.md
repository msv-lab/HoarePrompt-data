Example Answer:
The function returns the word at the index `n` in the list `ones`. Since `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, the return value will be the word representing the number `s`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the number `s`.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representing the number `s`**
