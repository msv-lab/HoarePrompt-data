Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. If `s` is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representation of the tens place determined by `tens[s // 10]`. Otherwise, the function returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place, calculated by `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. All possible cases are handled within the postcondition.***
