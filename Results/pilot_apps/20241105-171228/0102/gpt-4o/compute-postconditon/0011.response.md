The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The function utilizes two lists, `ones` and `teens`, which contain word representations of numbers from zero to nine and numbers in the teens range respectively. 

Based on the value of `s`, the function returns the word representation of the number as follows:
- If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the word representation of the number `s` from the `ones` list.
- If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the word representation of the number in the teens range from the `teens` list.
- If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. This is determined by concatenating the word representation of the tens place and ones place using `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`, unless `s` is exactly divisible by 10, in which case the function returns the word representation of 10 from the `tens` list.

The function ensures that all possible edge cases and scenarios within the specified ranges are handled appropriately in the postcondition, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of the program's behavior.
Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `s` such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99 and returns the word representation of the number based on the specified ranges and lists.**
