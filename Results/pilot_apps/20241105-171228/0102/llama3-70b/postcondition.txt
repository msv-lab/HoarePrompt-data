*`s` is assigned the input value as an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the value at index `s` in the ones array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the program prints the value at index (`s - 10`) in the teens array. If `s` is 20 or greater, the program prints the value at index (`s // 10`) in the tens array followed by a hyphen and the value at index (`s % 10`) in the ones array if `s` is not a multiple of 10; otherwise, only the value at index (`s // 10`) in the tens array is printed.
