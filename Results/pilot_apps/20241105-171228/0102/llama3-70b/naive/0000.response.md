Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly converts the input integer score into words following the English numerals. It covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) and provides the correct output for each case. The code handles single-digit numbers, numbers in the teens, and numbers in the tens correctly. There are no edge cases or potential inputs where the program fails to produce the expected output.
