Postcondition: ***s is assigned the input value as an integer. If s is less than 20, the program prints the value at index (s - 10) in the teens array. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the value at index (s // 10) in the tens array followed by a hyphen and the value at index (s % 10) in the ones array if s is not a multiple of 10; otherwise, only the value at index (s // 10) in the tens array is printed.***
