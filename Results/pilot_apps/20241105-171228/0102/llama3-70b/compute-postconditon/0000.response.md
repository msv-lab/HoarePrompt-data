Example Answer:
The list `ones` contains string representations of numbers from 0 to 9. The previous state does not contain any relevant variables. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is a list of string representations of numbers from 0 to 9.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is a list of string representations of numbers from 0 to 9**
