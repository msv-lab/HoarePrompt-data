Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The value of `i` is 2, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 2`. The updated value of `max_divisor` depends on the comparison with the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 2`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 2`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1**
