Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is updated based on the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A or remains as the first element of list A. `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
