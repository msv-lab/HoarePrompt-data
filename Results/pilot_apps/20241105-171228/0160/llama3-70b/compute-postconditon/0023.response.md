Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 2` if i * i is not equal to gcd. The value of `max_divisor` is determined by the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A or remains as the first element of list A. `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1.**
