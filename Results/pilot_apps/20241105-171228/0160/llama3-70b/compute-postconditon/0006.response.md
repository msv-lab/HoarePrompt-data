Example Answer:
`gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor between the current value of `gcd` and the integer at index `i` in list `A`. The previous values of `gcd`, `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers, and `gcd` is updated based on the gcd calculation.
Output State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers, and `gcd` is updated based on the gcd calculation**
