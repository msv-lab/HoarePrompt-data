Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input values of N, K, and the list A correctly.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A using the math.gcd() function.
- Then, it iterates through all the divisors of the gcd and finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
