Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program follows the problem description and correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The code first reads the input values, calculates the sum of the array, finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array, and then finds all divisors of the sum_A. Finally, it iterates through the divisors and checks if the divisor can divide all elements of A after the operations with the given constraints. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it prints that divisor. The code covers all potential cases and correctly determines the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
