Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. One edge case that the code does not handle correctly is when the sum of the array elements `sum_A` is not a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. In this case, the loop will not execute, and the set of divisors `divisors` will be empty. The code should consider this scenario and output an appropriate message or handle it differently.
