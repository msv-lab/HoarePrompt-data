Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor and at least one more divisor, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
