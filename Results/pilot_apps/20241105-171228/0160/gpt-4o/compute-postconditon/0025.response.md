Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is the next integer in the range and less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the set `divisors` will contain all the divisors of `x` found so far. 
Output State: **`divisors` contains the updated divisors after executing the if statement, `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))**
