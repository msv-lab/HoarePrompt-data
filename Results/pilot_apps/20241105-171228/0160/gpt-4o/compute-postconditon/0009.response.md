Example Answer: 
`gcd_result` is updated by taking the gcd of the previous `gcd_result` and `num`. The previous value of `gcd_result` and `num` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, sum_A is the sum of elements in list A, gcd_result is updated by taking the gcd of the previous gcd_result and num, lst has at least 4 elements, the index of the first element in lst is 3.
