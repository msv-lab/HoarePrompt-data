According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the set of divisors `divisors`. If there are more divisors in the set, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the set of divisors needs to have at least one more divisor excluding the current one.
State: **`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor and at least one more divisor**
