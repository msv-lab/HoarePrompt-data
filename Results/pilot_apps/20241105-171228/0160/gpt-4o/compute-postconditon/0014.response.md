Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `lst` and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list starting from the second element. If the list has only one element, the function returns the first element as the `gcd_result`. The code does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-integer elements, which could lead to potential errors.**
