Postcondition: ***`divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement. If `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`. The postcondition ensures that all possible cases of `x` and `i` are handled, and the divisors are correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the if statement.***
