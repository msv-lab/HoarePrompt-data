The function `func` accepts a parameter `lst`. 
Parameter constraints: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, and `sum_A` is the sum of elements in list A.
After executing the function body, `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list starting from the second element. N and K remain the same, A is the list of integers, and `sum_A` is the sum of elements in list A. If the list has only one element, the loop does not execute and `gcd_result` remains the first element of the list. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `lst` and calculate the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list starting from the second element. If the list has only one element, the first element is returned as `gcd_result`.
