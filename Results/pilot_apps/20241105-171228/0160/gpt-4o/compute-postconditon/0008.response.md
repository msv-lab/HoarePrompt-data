According to the code, the loop can execute again if the list `lst` has at least 4 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 3 elements, the index of the first element is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `lst` must have at least 4 elements, and the index of the first element should be 3.
State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, sum_A is the sum of elements in list A, gcd_result is updated by taking the gcd of the previous gcd_result and num, lst has at least 4 elements, the index of the first element in lst is 3**
