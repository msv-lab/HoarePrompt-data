Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the current value of `i` and added to the set `divisors`. The loop continues until `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains the updated divisors after executing the if statement, `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.
Output State: **`divisors` contains the updated divisors after executing the if statement, `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))**.
