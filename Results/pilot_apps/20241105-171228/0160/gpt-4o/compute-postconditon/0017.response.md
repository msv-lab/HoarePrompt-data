Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `i` is the current value of `x`. Therefore, `x` is added to the set `divisors`. As `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the set `divisors` now contains `x` as one of its elements.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the value of `x`, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
