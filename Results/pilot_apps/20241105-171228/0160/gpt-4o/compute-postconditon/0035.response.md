According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `divisors`. If the set `divisors` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the state to ensure that the `divisors` set is not empty. Additionally, since the function returns a set of unique divisors, it implies that each divisor in the set must be unique. Therefore, you need to ensure that the divisors in the set are distinct.
State: **`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, the divisors are in sorted order in reverse**
