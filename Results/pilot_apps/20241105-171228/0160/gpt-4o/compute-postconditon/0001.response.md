Example Answer: 
The list A is assigned the values obtained by mapping integers to the input split by spaces. The input can be any list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input**
