Example Answer: 
The sum of the elements in list A is calculated and assigned to `sum_A`. The initial values of N and K are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, and `sum_A` is the sum of elements in list A.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, and `sum_A` is the sum of elements in list A.**
