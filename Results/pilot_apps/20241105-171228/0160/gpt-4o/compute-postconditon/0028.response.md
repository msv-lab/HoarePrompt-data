According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement. `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement, `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
