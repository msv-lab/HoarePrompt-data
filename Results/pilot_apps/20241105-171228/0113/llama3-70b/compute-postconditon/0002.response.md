Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `n` is a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be the initial value of `n` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n+1 ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a value based on the new value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n+1 ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a value based on the new value of `k`**
