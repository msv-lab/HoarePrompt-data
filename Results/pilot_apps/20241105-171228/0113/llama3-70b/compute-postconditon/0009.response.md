Example Answer:
If k is 0, the loop will not execute, so n, k, and x remain the same. If k is greater than 0, n will be updated to the smallest multiple of x greater than the initial n. The value of x will be updated based on the new value of k that makes n % x not equal to 0. Since there is no information given about the initial values of n, k, and x, the output state will depend on these initial values.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of n, k, and x**
