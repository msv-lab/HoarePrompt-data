According to the code, the loop can execute again if the result of the modulo operation `n % x` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must not be divisible by the new value of `x`. Since the value of `n` is a positive integer greater than the initial value, and `k` remains the same, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `x`.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than the initial value, k remains the same, x is a value based on the new value of k that makes n % x not equal to 0**
