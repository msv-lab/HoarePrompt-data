According to the code, the loop can execute again if the result of the modulo operation of n by x is not equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, x needs to be adjusted such that n % x is not equal to 0. 
Since x is based on the new value of k, we need to adjust k in such a way that x changes to a value where n % x is not equal to 0.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n+1 ≤ 10^9, k is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k+1 ≤ 8, x is a value based on the new value of k**
