Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `multiplier` is one of the specified values. The `math.gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. Based on this calculation, `x` is computed. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of the calculation**
