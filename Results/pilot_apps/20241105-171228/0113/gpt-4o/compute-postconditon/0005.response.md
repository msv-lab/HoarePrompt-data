Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values of positive integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the input. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer ranging from 0 to 8.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer ranging from 0 to 8**
