Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the minimum number that ends with at least k zeros and is divisible by n.
2. The program uses the formula x = (n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))) to find the smallest number x that meets the requirements.
3. The program uses the math.gcd() function to calculate the greatest common divisor of n and the multiplier, ensuring that x is a multiple of n.
4. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem description.
