Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is in the list `a`, `posn` will store the index of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`**
