Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input string split by spaces to integers. The input is assumed to contain n distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**
