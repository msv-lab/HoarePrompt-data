Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `pos1`. The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, so if 1 is present in the list, `pos1` will store its index. The value of `pos1` will depend on the position of 1 in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`**
