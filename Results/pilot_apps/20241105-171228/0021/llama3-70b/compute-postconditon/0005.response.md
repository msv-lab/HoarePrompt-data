Example Answer:
The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`. Since `pos1` stores the index of 1 and `posn` stores the index of `n`, the minimum distance between them is calculated and compared with `n - 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`, and `min_dist` is the minimum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`, and `min_dist` is the minimum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`**
