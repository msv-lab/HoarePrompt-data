Example Answer:
The maximum distance among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4 needs to be calculated and printed. Since the values of dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4 depend on the initial values of min_pos and max_pos, the specific values of these variables are required to determine the maximum distance. The output state will be updated accordingly based on the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the position of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n-1 and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and `min_pos`, and the maximum distance is printed.**
