Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the position of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n-1 and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
