Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in list `a` and assigns it to `min_pos`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in the list `a` will be the position where 1 is located in the list. Therefore, `min_pos` will be the position of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the position of 1 in list `a`**
