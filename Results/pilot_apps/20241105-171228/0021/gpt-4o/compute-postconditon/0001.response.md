Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted by the user after converting them to integers. The length of the list will be `n` and each value will be distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Since `a` is a list, the output state will be: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n**
