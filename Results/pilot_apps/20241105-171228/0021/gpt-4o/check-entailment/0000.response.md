Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the initial positions of the minimum and maximum elements, then considers all possible swaps to maximize the distance between them. The code correctly computes the absolute differences between the positions and finds the maximum possible distance after one swap. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that the code is handling the problem correctly.
