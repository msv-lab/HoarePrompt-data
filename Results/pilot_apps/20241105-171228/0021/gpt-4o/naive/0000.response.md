Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the size of the permutation and the list of distinct integers.
2. It accurately determines the initial positions of the minimum and maximum elements.
3. It calculates all possible new distances after performing one swap by considering all four possible swap options.
4. Finally, it finds and prints the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap.
5. The program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each example given.
