Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `find_smallest_possible_n` takes in two strings `s` and `sub` as input.
- It calculates the frequency of characters in both `s` and `sub` using Counter.
- Then, it subtracts the frequency of characters in `sub` from `s`. If 'sub_counter' is empty, 's_counter' remains unchanged.
- The function then generates a list of possible numbers based on the remaining characters in `s`.
- It finds the smallest number from the list of possible numbers and returns it.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description of finding the smallest possible integer `n` that can be formed given a shuffled string `s` and a remembered substring `sub`.
- The code accounts for all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
