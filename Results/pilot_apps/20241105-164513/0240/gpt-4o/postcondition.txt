*The function `func` accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It calculates the frequency of characters in both strings using Counter. Then, it subtracts the frequency of characters in `sub` from `s`. If 'sub_counter' is empty, 's_counter' remains unchanged. The function then generates a list of possible numbers based on the remaining characters in `s`. It finds the smallest number from the list of possible numbers and returns it.
