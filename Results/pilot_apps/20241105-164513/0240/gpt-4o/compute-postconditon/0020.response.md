Example Answer:
The Counter function creates a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the Counter will return an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state is `s_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `s`.
Output State: **`s_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `s`**
