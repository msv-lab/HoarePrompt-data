Example Answer:
The function `func` is called with arguments `s` and `sub`. The function processes these arguments and returns a result. The variables `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `s` is a string, and `sub` is a string. The function call does not affect the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `s` is a string, `sub` is a string.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `s` is a string, `sub` is a string**
