The function `func` accepts two string parameters, `num_str` and `sub`. The function checks if the substring `sub` is present in the string `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to the length of `sub`. The function does not return any specific value, but it performs the check and may return True or False based on the conditions specified. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters, num_str and sub, and checks if sub is present in num_str and if their lengths are equal.**
