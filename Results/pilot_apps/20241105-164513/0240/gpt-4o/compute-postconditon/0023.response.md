Example Answer: 
The value of `s_counter[char]` is decreased by the value of `sub_counter[char]`. The initial state has `s_counter` containing the frequency of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` containing the frequency of characters in string `sub`, and `char` being the first key in the `sub_counter` dictionary. After execution, the frequency of the character `char` in `s_counter` is reduced by the frequency of `char` in `sub_counter`. 
Output State: **Updated s_counter after subtracting the frequency of char from sub_counter**
