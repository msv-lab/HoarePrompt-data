Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the result of joining the next permutation of the characters in the string `chars`. The values of the variables `num_str`, `sub`, and `chars` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`**
