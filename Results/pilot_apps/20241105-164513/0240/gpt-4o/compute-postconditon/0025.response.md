Example Answer:
The frequency of the character `char` in `s_counter` is decremented by the frequency of the same character in `sub_counter`. The specific values of `char`, `s_counter`, and `sub_counter` are not provided, so the output state is the updated `s_counter` after subtracting the frequency of `char` from `sub_counter`.
Output State: **Updated s_counter after subtracting the frequency of char from sub_counter**
