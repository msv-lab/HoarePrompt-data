According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings. `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`. If `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. Additionally, if `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for this new `candidate`, then the loop will execute again. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the next permutation of `chars` should be generated, and `func2(candidate, sub)` should evaluate to true for this new `candidate`.

State: **Next permutation of `chars` is generated, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`**
