Example Answer:
The `input()` function reads input from standard input and `split()` splits the input into a list of strings. The variable `data` is assigned this list of strings. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from input**
