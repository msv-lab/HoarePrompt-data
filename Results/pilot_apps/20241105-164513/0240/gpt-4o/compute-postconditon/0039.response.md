Example Answer: 
`sub` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `data`, so `sub` will be a string. The value of `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, and `s` is a string, which are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `s` is a string, `sub` is a string.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `s` is a string, `sub` is a string**
