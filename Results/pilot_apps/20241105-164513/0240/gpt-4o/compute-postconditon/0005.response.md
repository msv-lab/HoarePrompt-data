Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the concatenated string of `perm`, but the values of `perm`, `num_str`, `sub`, and `chars` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `num_str` is a string, `sub` is a string, `chars` is a non-empty string, `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`.
Output State: **`num_str` is a string, `sub` is a string, `chars` is a non-empty string, `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`**
