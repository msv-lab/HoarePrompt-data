According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sub_counter` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `s_counter` and `sub_counter` will remain the same. So for the loop to be executed, the `sub_counter` dictionary must have at least 1 key-value pair, and `char` is the first key in the `sub_counter` dictionary.
State: **`s_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `sub` with at least 1 key-value pair, `char` is the first key in the `sub_counter` dictionary.**
