Example Answer:
The `candidate` variable is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The state of other variables is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Next permutation of `chars` is generated, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`.
Output State: **Next permutation of `chars` is generated, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`**
