Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `smallest_n` that takes in two input strings `s` and `t`.
- It creates a set `t_set` containing the characters of string `t`.
- It then iterates through each character in string `s`, checking if it is present in the set `t_set`. If it is, the character is added to the resulting string `n`.
- Finally, the characters from string `t` are added to `n`, and the resulting string is converted to an integer and returned.
- The code correctly follows the problem description as it constructs the smallest possible initial integer `n` by including only the characters present in both strings `s` and `t`. The output hints also confirm that the function returns a new string `n` containing characters present in both `s` and `t`.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided examples.
