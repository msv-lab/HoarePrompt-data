According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `s` and how they relate to the substring `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Check if the next character `c` in the string `s` is in the set `t_set`.
2. If `c` is in `t_set`, update `n` to include `c`.
3. Otherwise, no changes need to be made to `n`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`.**
