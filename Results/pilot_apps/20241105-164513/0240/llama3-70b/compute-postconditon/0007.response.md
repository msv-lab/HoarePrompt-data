According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `c` is the next character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`**
