Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned by taking an input from the user. The previous value of `t` is unknown, and it depends on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits and `t` is a substring of `s` where `t` is the input substring.
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits and `t` is a substring of `s` where `t` is the input substring**
