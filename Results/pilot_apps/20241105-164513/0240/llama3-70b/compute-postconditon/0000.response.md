Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The previous values of `s` and `t` are not provided, so the output state is `s` is a string of digits and `t` is a substring of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits and `t` is a substring of `s`**
