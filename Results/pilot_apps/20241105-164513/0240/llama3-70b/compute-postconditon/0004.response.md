Since the loop is iterating over each character in string `s`, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one character in `s`. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `s` is not an empty string. 
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is an empty string**
