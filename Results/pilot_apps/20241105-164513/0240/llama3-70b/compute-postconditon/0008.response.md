Example Answer:
`n` is concatenated with the value `c`, where `c` is the next character in `s`. The previous values of the variables are `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, and `c` is the next character in `s`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`**
