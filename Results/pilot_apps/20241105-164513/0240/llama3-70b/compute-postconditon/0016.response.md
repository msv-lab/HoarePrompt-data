Example Answer:
The value of `n` is an empty string concatenated with the value of `t`, which is also an empty string. So, `n` remains an empty string. The function then returns `int(n)`, which converts the empty string to an integer, resulting in 0 being returned.
Output State: **`t` is an empty string, `n` is an empty string, and the function returns 0**
