Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values based on user input using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is split by spaces, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned accordingly. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can range from 0 to 100 as per the precondition.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
