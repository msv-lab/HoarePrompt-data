Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x` and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, so the maximum value `max_upvotes` can take is 200. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200**
