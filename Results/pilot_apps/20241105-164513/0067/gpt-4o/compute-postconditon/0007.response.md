Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('?')` does not affect the variables or their values. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`.**
