Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly checks if a given string is an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the string from both ends towards the center, comparing characters to determine if the string is symmetric about its middle. The code covers all potential cases, and the output of the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
