Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True. The loop checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions. If a mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If the string is not long enough to complete the loop, the loop does not execute.**
