Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True initially and can be set to False if `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` for `i` equal to 2. In such a case, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is exited. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases and scenarios where the palindrome condition is not met.***
