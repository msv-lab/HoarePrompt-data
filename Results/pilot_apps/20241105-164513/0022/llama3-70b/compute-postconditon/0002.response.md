Example Answer:
`is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The other variables `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True**
