Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is 0, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This covers all possible scenarios for the execution of the if else block.***
