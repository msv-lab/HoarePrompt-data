According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True initially and can be set to False if the condition `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` is met, `i` is 2**
