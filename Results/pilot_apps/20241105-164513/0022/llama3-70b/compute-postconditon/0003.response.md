According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `is_spalindrome` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
