Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of string `s`. Since `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 representing the length of the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
