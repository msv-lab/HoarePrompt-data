*`s` is a string. If the length of `s` is even, the function `func` checks if all pairs of characters at symmetric positions are equal. If all pairs are equal, the program prints 'TAK'. If the pairs are not equal, the program prints 'NIE'. If the length of `s` is odd, the program always prints 'NIE'.
