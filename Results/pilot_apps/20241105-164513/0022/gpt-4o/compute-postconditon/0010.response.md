According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 since `i` is less than `n // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, and `i` is 3**
