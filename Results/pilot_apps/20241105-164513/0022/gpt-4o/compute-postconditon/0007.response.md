According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
