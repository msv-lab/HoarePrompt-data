Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an input `n` and calculates the remainder when divided by 10. Based on the value of the remainder, it rounds the number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. This logic aligns with the problem description for all possible cases of `n`. The code is correct as it accurately implements the rounding mechanism described in the problem statement.
