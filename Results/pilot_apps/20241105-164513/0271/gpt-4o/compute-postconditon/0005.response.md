Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is calculated based on the value of `remainder`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is equal to `n` minus `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is equal to `n` plus (10 minus `remainder`). The value of `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the possible values of `remainder` are 0 to 9. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is calculated based on the value of `remainder`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is calculated based on the value of `remainder`**
