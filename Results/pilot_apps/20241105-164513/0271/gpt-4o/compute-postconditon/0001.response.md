Example Answer:
The value of `n` is divided by 10, and the remainder is assigned to `remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the possible values for `remainder` are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10.
Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10**
