Example Answer:
The code calculates `n - n % 10`, where `%` is the modulus operator. This operation computes the difference between n and the remainder of n divided by 10. For any non-negative integer n, this will essentially remove the last digit of n. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
