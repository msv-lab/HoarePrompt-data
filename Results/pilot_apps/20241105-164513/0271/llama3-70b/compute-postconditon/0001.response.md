Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `n` to the console. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the value of `n` is printed.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the value of `n` is printed**
