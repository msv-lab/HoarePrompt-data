Example Answer:
The value of n is added to the result of (10 - n % 10), where n % 10 gives the remainder when n is divided by 10. Since n is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, n % 10 can be any value between 0 and 9. Adding this to 10 gives a result between 10 and 19. Therefore, the final output will be the sum of n and a number between 10 and 19. 
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result is between n+10 and n+19**
