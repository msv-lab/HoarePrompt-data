Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It first checks if the number already ends with 0, in which case it prints the number as it is. If the last digit of the number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder of the number divided by 10. If the last digit of the number is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder of the number divided by 10. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly rounds the number as described in the problem statement.
