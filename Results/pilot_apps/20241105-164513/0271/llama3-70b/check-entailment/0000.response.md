Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all cases. The code correctly rounds the non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n % 10` is 0, the value of `n` is printed as it is already rounded. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the output is equal to `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the output is between `n + 10` and `n + 19`. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem description.
