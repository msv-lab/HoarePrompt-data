Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is assigned a value of 0 for the key `color`. This indicates that the count of the color represented by `color` is now 0. The initial state does not provide information about the specific value of `color`, so the output state is: colors is a list of n+1 integers representing colors of lightsabers with the next color to be processed; `color_counts` dictionary may have other colors as keys with their respective counts, and the count of the color represented by `color` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **colors is a list of n+1 integers representing colors of lightsabers with the next color to be processed; `color_counts` dictionary may have other colors as keys with their respective counts, and the count of the color represented by `color` is incremented by 1**
