Output State: **The loop calculates the count of each unique color in the `colors` list and updates the `window_counts` dictionary accordingly. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. The variables `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains less than `n`, `color_counts` dictionary contains the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, and `window_counts` dictionary may have the newly added key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` at each iteration. If the loop does not execute due to `i` being greater than or equal to `n`, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.**
