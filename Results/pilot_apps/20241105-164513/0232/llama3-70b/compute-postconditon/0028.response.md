Postcondition: ***`color_counts` dictionary contains the count of each unique color in the `colors` list with at least 1 color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` dictionary contains the newly added key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
