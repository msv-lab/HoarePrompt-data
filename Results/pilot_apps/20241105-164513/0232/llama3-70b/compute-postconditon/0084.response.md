Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, `found` is updated, `colors` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` was not in `window_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
