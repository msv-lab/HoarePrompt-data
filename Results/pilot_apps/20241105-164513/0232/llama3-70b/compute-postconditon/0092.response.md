Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, `found` is True, `colors` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `color` is assigned the value at index `j+1`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j+1`. After the execution of the if block, if `color` was not in `window_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 0. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
