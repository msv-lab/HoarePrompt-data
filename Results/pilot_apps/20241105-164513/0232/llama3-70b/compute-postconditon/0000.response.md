Example Answer: 
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The input is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `colors` and `counts` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m. 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; `n` and `m` are input integers.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m. 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; `n` and `m` are input integers**
