Output State: **After the loop executes, the variable `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `i`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. The `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key, where if `color` is not already a key, it is added with a value of 1; otherwise, the value is increased by 1. The variable `found` becomes True if all count values in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values from the `counts` list and the program breaks out of the loop. If `colors` is a list with fewer elements than `n`, the loop will not execute.**
