Example Answer:
`color_counts` is a dictionary that is updated to include a key `color` with a value of 0. The previous state of `color_counts` was an empty dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is: colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color; `color_counts` is a dictionary with key `color` and value 0.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color; `color_counts` is a dictionary with key `color` and value 0**
