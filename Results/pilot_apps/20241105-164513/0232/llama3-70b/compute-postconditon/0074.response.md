Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `n` remains greater than or equal to `i+2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key. If `color` was already present, its value is set to 1; if not, its value is set to 0. The variable `found` remains True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts` is updated with a value of 0 for `color`.***
