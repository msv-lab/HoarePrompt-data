According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the colors list. If the list has at least 1 color, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the colors list must have at least 1 integer representing a color of a lightsaber. Additionally, since `color_counts` is an empty dictionary at the start, it needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial state of the loop. 
State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
