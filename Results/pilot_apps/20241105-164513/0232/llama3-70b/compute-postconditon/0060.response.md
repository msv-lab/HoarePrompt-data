Example Answer:
The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `window_counts`, and `found` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key, `found` is True.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key, `found` is True**
