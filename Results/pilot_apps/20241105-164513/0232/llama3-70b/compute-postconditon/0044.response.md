Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if all the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. The integrity of the program variables is maintained, ensuring that `window_counts` contains the updated count for the newly added `color` key if it was not present before. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
