Example Answer:
The `window_counts` dictionary is updated with the `color` key having a value of 0. The other variables and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key with a value of 0, `found` is True.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key with a value of 0, `found` is True**
