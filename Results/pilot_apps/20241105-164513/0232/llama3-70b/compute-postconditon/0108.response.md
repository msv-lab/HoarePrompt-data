Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the output state remains the same as the initial state where `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `i` is unchanged, `window_counts` remains the same dictionary mapping colors to counts, `found` remains True, `colors` and `color` are not affected. If `found` is False, there is no change in the output state as the loop does not execute.***
