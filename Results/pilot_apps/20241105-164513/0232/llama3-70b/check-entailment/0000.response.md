Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to find if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the specified counts of lightsabers of each color. However, the code provided only checks for individual colors and does not consider the contiguous interval aspect of the problem. This means that the program may not accurately determine if there is a valid interval that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
