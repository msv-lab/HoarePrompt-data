Example Answer:
`colors` is assigned a list of integers after converting the input split values to integers. The variables `n` and `m` are not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input split as integers, `colors` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input split as integers, `colors` is a list of integers**
