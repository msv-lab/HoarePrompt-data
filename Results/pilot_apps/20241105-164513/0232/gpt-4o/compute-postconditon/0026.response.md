Example Answer:
The list `k` is created by mapping each input value (split by space) to an integer. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input split as integers, `colors` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input split as integers, `colors` is a list of integers**
