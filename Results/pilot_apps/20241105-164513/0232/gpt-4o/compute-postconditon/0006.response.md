Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`, `current_counts` is updated, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
