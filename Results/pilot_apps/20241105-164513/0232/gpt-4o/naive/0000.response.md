Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an interval with prescribed color counts exists. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the current counts of each color and checks if the window meets the desired counts for each color. The program iterates through the colors and updates the counts accordingly. If at any point the window meets the desired counts for all colors, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO". The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
