Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, after execution, `n` will hold a positive integer value. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
