Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'D' in the `votes` string with one additional value `d_index + n` if `d_index < r_index`, otherwise `r_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'R' in the `votes` string with one additional value `r_index + n`. `i` ranges from 0 to n-1, `v` takes the value of each character in the `votes` string, `d_index` takes the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` takes the value popped from the front of `r_queue` where `r_index` is the first index of 'R' in the `votes` string.***
