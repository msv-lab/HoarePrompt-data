Example Answer:
A new empty list `d_queue` is initialized. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
