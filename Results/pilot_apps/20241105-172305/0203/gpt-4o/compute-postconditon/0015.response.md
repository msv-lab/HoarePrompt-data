Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`. If `v` is 'R', then `r_queue` contains the appended index `i`. The program ensures that the appropriate index is appended to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the value of `v` and maintains the integrity of the indices and characters in the `votes` string.***
