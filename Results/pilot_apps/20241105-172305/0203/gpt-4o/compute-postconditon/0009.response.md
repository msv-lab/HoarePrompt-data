Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. The previous values of `n`, `votes`, `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `i`, and `v` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` contains indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string along with the new index i, `r_queue` contains indices of 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `i` is incremented by 1, `v` takes the value of the next character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` contains indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string along with the new index i, `r_queue` contains indices of 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `i` is incremented by 1, `v` takes the value of the next character in the `votes` string**
