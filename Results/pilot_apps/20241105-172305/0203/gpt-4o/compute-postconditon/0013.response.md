Example Answer: 
The code appends the index `i` to `d_queue`. The previous state of `d_queue` is not provided, but after executing this code, `d_queue` will contain the appended index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`**
