Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'D' in the `votes` string, `r_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'R' in the `votes` string, `i` ranges from 0 to n-1, `v` takes the value of each character in the `votes` string, `d_index` takes the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` takes the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then the new value obtained by appending `d_index + n` is added to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then the new value obtained by appending `r_index + n` is added to `r_queue`.***
