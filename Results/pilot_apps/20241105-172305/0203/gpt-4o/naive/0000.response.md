Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem. It keeps track of the positions of 'D' and 'R' employees using queues, processes the queues according to the rules of the voting procedure, and determines the winner based on the remaining non-empty queue. The implementation covers all possible cases and provides the correct outcome for each scenario.
