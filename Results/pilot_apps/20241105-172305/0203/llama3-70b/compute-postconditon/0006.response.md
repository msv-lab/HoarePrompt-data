Example Answer: 
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list**
