According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being an input integer does not directly affect the loop execution. So for the loop to execute, the fractions list must have at least 1 fraction, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the list. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list**
