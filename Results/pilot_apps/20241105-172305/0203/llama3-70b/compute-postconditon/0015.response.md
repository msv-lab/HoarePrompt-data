Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 3, `remocrats` remains unchanged. If `fraction` is not 'D', `depublicans` remains unchanged, `remocrats` is incremented by 3. The list `fractions` contains at least 3 fractions, and `fraction` is the third fraction in the list.***
