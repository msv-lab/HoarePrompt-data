Example Answer: 
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. The `input().split()` function takes input and splits it into a list of strings, then `map(int, ...)` maps the `int` function to each element of the list, converting them to integers. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided**
