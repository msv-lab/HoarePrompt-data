Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided. `a_floor` is calculated as described above, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1. `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1. `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. If a_floor is greater than b_floor, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. This ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum time based on the specified conditions and calculations, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
