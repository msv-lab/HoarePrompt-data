Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000**
