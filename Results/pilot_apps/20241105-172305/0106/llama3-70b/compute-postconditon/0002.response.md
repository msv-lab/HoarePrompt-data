Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `b` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `a_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided, `a_floor` is calculated as described above.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided, `a_floor` is calculated as described above**
