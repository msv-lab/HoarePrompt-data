Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are provided integers, and the calculation is performed accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided, `a_floor` is calculated as described above; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
