Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for Edward and Natasha based on their apartment numbers.
- It then calculates the minimum time to reach Natasha's block by taking into account the distance between their blocks and the circular nature of the building.
- The code also calculates the minimum time to reach Natasha's floor by considering the direction Edward needs to travel (up or down) and the time it takes to move between floors.
- Finally, the code prints the sum of the minimum block time and minimum floor time, which represents the total minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha. 
- The code seems to cover all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given input.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and there are no apparent missing edge cases, the correctness of the code is **True**.
