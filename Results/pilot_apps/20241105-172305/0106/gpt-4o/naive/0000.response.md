1. The program correctly calculates the block, floor, and apartment within the floor for both Edward and Natasha.
2. It accurately calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment and reach the ground floor using the elevator.
3. The program correctly determines the minimum time to walk between the blocks in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
4. It accurately computes the time for Edward to reach the target floor in Natasha's block.
5. Finally, the total time calculated by the program is the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program covers all potential cases and works correctly according to the problem description.
