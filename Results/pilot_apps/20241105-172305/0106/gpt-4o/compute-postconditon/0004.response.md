The function `func` accepts a parameter `apartment`. Additionally, the function operates based on the values of `m` and `k`, which are positive integers satisfying 1 <= m, k <= 1000. The function also considers the positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b. Without knowing the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, no specific output state can be determined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is dependent on the input values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, along with the constraints on `a` and `b`.
