Example Answer: 
The function `func` is called with the argument `b`. The function calculates the block and floor numbers of the given `apartment` based on the values of `m` and `k`. The function returns the block and floor numbers. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`**.
Output State: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`**
