Example Answer:
`floor_within_block` is calculated by taking the modulus of `(apartment - 1)` with `(m * k)`. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, so the specific value of `floor_within_block` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific output state can be determined without the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **No specific output state can be determined without the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**
