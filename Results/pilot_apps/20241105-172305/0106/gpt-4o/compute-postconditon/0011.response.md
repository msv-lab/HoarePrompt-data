Output State: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`. If floor_a is 1, then the `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between block_a and block_b modulo n, multiplied by 15.**
