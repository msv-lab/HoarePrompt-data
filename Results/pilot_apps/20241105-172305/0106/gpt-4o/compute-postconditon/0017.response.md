The function `func` accepts five parameters: n, m, k, a, and b. Here, n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.

The function `func` returns the total time taken to move from apartment a to apartment b in a housing complex. If floor_a is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1. `direct_walk_time` is the absolute difference between block_a and block_b modulo n, multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the total time taken to move from apartment a to apartment b in a housing complex based on the given parameters and constraints. It considers the block number, floor number, and various time calculations involved in the movement. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b and calculates the total time taken to move from apartment a to apartment b in a housing complex.**
