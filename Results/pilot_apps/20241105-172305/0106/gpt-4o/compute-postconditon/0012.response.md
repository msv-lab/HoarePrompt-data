Example Answer: 
`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are known, so the calculation can be done directly. Therefore, the Output State is: block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`, if floor_a is 1, then the `time_to_exit` is 0, otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between block_a and block_b modulo n, multiplied by 15, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
Output State: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`, if floor_a is 1, then the `time_to_exit` is 0, otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between block_a and block_b modulo n, multiplied by 15, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`**
