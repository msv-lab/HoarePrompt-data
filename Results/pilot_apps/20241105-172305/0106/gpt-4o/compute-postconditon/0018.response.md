Functionality: **The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` and calculates the block and floor numbers of apartments based on given conditions. It then determines the total time taken to move from apartment `a` to apartment `b` in a housing complex. The function considers various factors such as block numbers, floor numbers, walking times, and total time. However, the implementation details and specific output states are dependent on the input values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The function may not fully match the annotations provided, so it's important to consider the actual code for accurate functionality.**
