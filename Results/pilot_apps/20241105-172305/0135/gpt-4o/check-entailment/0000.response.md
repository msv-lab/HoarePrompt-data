Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` and returns "No" as stated in the problem description.
- For the case where `k` is less than `n`, the code iterates through a loop from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If a remainder is already present in `seen_remainders`, the code returns "No" as expected.
- If no duplicate remainders are found, the code returns "Yes" after the loop completes, which aligns with the problem description.
- The edge case of `k` being negative or zero is not mentioned in the problem description, so it is not necessary to be handled in the current implementation.
- The output hints also confirm the behavior of the code as described in the problem statement.
