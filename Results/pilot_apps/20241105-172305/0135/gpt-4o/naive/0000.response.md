Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the case where k is greater than or equal to n by returning "No" as specified in the problem description. 
For the case where k is less than n, the program iterates through all values of i from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders. If it finds a repeated remainder, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes". 
This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, so the program is correct.
