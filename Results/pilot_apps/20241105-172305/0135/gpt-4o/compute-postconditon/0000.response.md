Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. Both `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
