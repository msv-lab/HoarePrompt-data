According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute. Since k is greater than or equal to n for the function to return 'No', the loop should execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are already integers within the valid range. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
