Example Answer:
The function always returns the string 'No' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the function returns 'No'.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the function returns 'No'**
