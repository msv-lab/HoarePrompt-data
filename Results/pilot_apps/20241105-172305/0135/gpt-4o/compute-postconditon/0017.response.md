Output State: **Functionality: The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, both ranging from 1 to 10^18. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function iterates through a loop from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If a remainder is already present in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicate remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes' after the loop completes. Edge Case: If `k` is negative or zero, the function does not enter the loop, potentially causing an issue as the loop is expected to iterate at least once. This edge case is not handled in the current implementation.**
