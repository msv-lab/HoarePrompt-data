The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the initial state variables. If the remainder is already present in seen_remainders during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the modulo operation, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % (k + 1)`. The function returns 'Yes'.

Case_3: If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the initial state variables. If the remainder is already present in seen_remainders during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the modulo operation, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % (k + 1)`. The function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions and loop execution, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
