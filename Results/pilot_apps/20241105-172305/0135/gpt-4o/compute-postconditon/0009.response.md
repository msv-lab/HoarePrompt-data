Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by taking the modulo of n with i. Since the initial value of i is not provided, the output state only includes the information about the variables given in the initial state. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
