Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers n and k as input and then iterates over the range [1, k]. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of n divided by i and checks if this remainder has already been seen. If the remainder has been seen before, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end.

This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description. It ensures that all remainders obtained by dividing n by integers in the range [1, k] are distinct, as required by Imp. The code covers all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem requirements. The output hints also confirm that the code prints 'Yes' if all remainders are distinct, which is consistent with the code's behavior.
