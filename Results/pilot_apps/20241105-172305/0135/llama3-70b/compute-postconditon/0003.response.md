Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`. The values of `n` and `k` are obtained from user input and `seen` is an empty set. The output state is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`**
