Example Answer: 
The code adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The set `seen` contains the value of `remainder` and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1`. If `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1**.
