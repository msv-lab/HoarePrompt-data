Example Answer: 
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since we do not have information about the actual input values, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers with values obtained from user input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with values obtained from user input**
