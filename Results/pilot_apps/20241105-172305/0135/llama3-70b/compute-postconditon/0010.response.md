Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'No' and does not affect the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1**
