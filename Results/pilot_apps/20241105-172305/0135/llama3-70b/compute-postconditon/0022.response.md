Example Answer: 
After the loop executes, the set `seen` will contain all unique remainders from `n % i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, the loop prints 'No' and exits. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Since the loop does not modify any other variable and directly prints 'Yes', the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the loop prints 'Yes'**
