Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1. If `remainder` is already present in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
