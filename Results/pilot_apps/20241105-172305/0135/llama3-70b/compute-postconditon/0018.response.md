Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1, `i` is increased by 1. If `remainder` is already present in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits.***
