Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i + 1`, where `i` is not defined in the initial state. The value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1**.
