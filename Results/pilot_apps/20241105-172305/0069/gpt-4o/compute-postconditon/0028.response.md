Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the new value of `count` will be the previous value plus 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`**
