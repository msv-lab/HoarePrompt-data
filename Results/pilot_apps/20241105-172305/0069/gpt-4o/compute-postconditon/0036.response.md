Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix balances based on the values in string `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes, and `prefix_balances` will be a list of length `n + 1` with calculated prefix balances. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list contains -1. If `balance` is 0 but `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition; `results` list contains the appended count.***
