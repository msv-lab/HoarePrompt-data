Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, 'prefix_balances' will be updated for each element based on the balance of '0's and '1's in the string 's'. If 'n' is at least 1, 'prefix_balances' will reflect the updated balances. If 'n' is 0 or negative, 'prefix_balances' will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. If 'x' is in 'prefix_balances', -1 will be appended to 'results'. Otherwise, 0 will be appended to 'results'. In all cases, 'prefix_balances' retains its specified properties and 'results' reflects the appended values according to the conditions met in the if else block.***
