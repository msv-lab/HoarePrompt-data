According to the code, the loop can execute as long as T is greater than 0. Given that the IndexError is "list index out of range", it implies that the list being accessed is empty. Thus, in order for the loop to execute, the `results` list should have at least one element to prevent the IndexError. Additionally, the loop variable `_` does not have any specific requirements for its initial value. 
State: **IndexError: list index out of range, `index` is 1; `results` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `T` is greater than 0**
