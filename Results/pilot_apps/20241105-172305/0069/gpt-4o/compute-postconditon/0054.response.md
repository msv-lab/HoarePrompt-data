Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the string s. If s[i - 1] is '0', 1 is added to the prefix balance, otherwise, -1 is added. If x is in prefix_balances, the loop does not execute, prefix_balances is initialized to 0, and results has a new value of -1. If x is not in prefix_balances, the loop will execute at least once if n is at least 1. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute, prefix_balances will remain initialized to 0, and results contains one element with a value of 0.***
