Output State: **`T`, `n` is incremented by 1 if necessary, adjustments made to `results`, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is created with a length of `n + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, and `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
