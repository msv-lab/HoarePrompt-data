Postcondition: ***The loop executes, `count` is incremented by 1, and there is at least one element in `prefix_balances` where the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 are not satisfied. If both conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 are met, then `count` is incremented by 1.***
