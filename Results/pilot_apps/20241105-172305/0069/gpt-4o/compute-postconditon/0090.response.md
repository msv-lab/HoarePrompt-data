Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, initially 0, after the execution of the if statement, if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, `count` is incremented by 1. `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in the list. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 0.***
