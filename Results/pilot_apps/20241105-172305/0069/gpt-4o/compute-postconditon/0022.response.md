Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix balances based on the values in string `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes, and `prefix_balances` will be a list of length `n + 1` with calculated prefix balances. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list contains `-1`. Otherwise, if the loop does not execute because `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, and `results` contains a single element 0.***
