According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. This means the loop can execute one more time. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is initialized, `s` is assigned a string value, `balance` is calculated based on `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the given formula**
