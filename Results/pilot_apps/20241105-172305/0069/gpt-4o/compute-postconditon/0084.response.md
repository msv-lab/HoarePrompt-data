Example Answer:
The code appends -1 to the list `results`. The loop conditions and other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` has -1 appended to it.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` has -1 appended to it**
