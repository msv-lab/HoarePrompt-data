Example Answer:
`balance` is assigned the result of the difference between the count of '0's and the count of '1's in the string `s`. The previous values of `s` are known, so the count of '0's and '1's can be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`**
