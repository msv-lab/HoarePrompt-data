According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were observed:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is initialized
- `s` is assigned a string value
- `balance` is calculated based on `s`
- `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the given formula

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be updated to 4

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is initialized, `s` is assigned a string value, `balance` is calculated based on `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the given formula**
