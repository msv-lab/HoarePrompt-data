Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem. It handles the case where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes by checking if the desired balance $x$ is reachable from any prefix balance using the given string $s$. The program maintains prefix balances and calculates the count of prefixes with the desired balance $x$ accurately. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
