Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ for each test case. It considers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement:

1. If the current balance is equal to the desired balance $x$, it prints $n + 1$, indicating that there is a valid prefix of length $n$.
2. If the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the current balance is divisible by the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string $s$, it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of such prefixes.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to reach the desired balance $x$ and prints the result accordingly.

Since the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct result for each test case provided, the correctness of the program is **True**.
