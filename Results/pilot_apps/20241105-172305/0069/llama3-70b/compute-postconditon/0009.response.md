Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the expression (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
