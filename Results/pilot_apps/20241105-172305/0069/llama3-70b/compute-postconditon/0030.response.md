Postcondition: ***`T-1`, `n`, `x` are integers from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in `s`, and `balance` is calculated based on the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)` is printed. This covers all possible scenarios where the program execution results in either printing n + 1, -1, or the calculated expression based on the conditions provided.***
