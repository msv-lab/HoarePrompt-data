Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and provides a comprehensive overview of the program's state after the execution of the if-else block.***
