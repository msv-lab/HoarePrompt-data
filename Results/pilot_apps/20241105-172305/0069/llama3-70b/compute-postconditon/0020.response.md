Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are integers from input. `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. Depending on the balance and x values, the program will print different results. If balance is equal to x, then n is incremented by 1 before printing. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
