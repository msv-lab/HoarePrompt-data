Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `a` are already distinct positive integers, so sorting them will rearrange the values in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are distinct positive integers in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are distinct positive integers in ascending order**
