Output State: **If the loop executes, then `n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, `m` is increased by 1 for each iteration where this condition holds true, and `i` is adjusted accordingly. After the loop completes, `m` contains the total number of times the condition was met, and `i` is the index of the last checked element. If the loop does not execute (n=1), `m` remains 1 without any changes.**
