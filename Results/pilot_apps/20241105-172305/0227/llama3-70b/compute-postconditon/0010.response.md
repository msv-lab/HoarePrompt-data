According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than the current value of `i`, and all other states remain the same.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` and `i` are adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
