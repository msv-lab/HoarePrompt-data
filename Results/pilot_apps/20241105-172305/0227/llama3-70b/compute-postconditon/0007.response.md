According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is updated to 2, and `i` remains at 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is updated to 2, `i` is 2**
