Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned to the result of mapping the input split by space to integers. The values of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are now stored in the list `a`. The values of n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n do not change, but they are now also stored in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are distinct positive integers such that 1 <= a_k <= 10^9, and `a` contains the values of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are distinct positive integers such that 1 <= a_k <= 10^9, and `a` contains the values of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
