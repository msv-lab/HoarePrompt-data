According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` should be such that `i+1` is less than `n`. This means `i` should be less than `n-1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `i` is less than `n-1`**
