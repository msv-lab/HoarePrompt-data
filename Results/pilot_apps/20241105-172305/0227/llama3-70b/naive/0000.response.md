Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence and iterates through it to check if each element is equal to twice the previous element. If not, it increments the variable count. The code handles all potential cases where the sequence cannot be performed and outputs -1 in such cases. The code also ensures that the number of variables does not exceed 23, as stated in the problem description.
