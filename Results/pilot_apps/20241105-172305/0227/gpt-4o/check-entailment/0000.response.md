Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `min_variables` is attempting to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations, but there is an issue in the logic.

The issue lies in the fact that the variable `m`, which represents the minimum number of variables needed, is incremented whenever a new number in the sequence `a` cannot be formed using the previously assigned variables. This logic does not guarantee the minimum number of variables required because it does not consider all possible combinations of variables that can form the required values.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The correct output should be -1 because it is not possible to form the sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the code will incorrectly output 2 because it will increment `m` when processing the number 5, even though it is not possible to form it using the previously assigned variables.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
