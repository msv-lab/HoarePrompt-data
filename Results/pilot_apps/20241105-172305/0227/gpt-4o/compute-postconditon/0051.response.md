Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 2 elements. If there exists an element at index `i` in the list `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is present in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True. In this case, `m` remains the same and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables `assigned`, `can_form`, and `m`.***
