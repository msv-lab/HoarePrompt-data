Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. It then iterates through the elements of list `a` from the second element onwards. For each element `a[i]`, it checks if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If found, `can_form` is set to True; otherwise, `m` is incremented by 1. The function returns the final value of `m`. The code implementation does not match the annotations completely, as the actual code does not handle the case where `n` is 1 explicitly.**
