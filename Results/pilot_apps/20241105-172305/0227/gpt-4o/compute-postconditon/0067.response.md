Example Answer: 
The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which reads input from the standard input and splits it based on whitespace. The initial state of the program is not provided, so the output state is: `data` contains the input values as a list after splitting.
Output State: **`data` contains the input values as a list after splitting**
