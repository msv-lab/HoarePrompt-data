Example Answer: 
The code creates a new list `a` by converting all elements in `data` except the first one to integers. The value of `n` is determined by the first element of `data`. Therefore, the output state is: `data` contains the input values as a list after splitting, `n` is an integer determined by the first element of `data`, `a` is a list of integers created from the remaining elements in `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the input values as a list after splitting, `n` is an integer determined by the first element of `data`, `a` is a list of integers created from the remaining elements in `data`**
