Output State: **`assigned` has at least 1 element. If there exists an element in the list `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `can_form` is False after the loop, `m` is incremented by 1. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `m` remains the same.**
