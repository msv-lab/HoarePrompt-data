According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, a new element `a[i]` was added to `assigned`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it**
