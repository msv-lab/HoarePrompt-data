Postcondition: ***`m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `assigned` set is not empty, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` set, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. All initial conditions are preserved, and the program state is updated accordingly after the if statement executes, handling the necessary edge cases.***
