According to the code, the loop can execute again if `assigned` still has elements left. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it. So for the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must have at least one more element other than `a[i+1]`.
State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it, and it has at least one more element other than `a[i+1]`. `can_form` remains False, `x` continues to be the first element in the `assigned` list**
