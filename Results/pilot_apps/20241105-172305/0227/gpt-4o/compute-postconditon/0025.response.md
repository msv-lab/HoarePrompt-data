According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the assigned list has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it. So, for the loop to be executed, the assigned list must have at least 1 element and `x` should be the first element in the assigned list.
State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list**
