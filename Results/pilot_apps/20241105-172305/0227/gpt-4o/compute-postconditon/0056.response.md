According to the code, the loop can execute again if there is at least one more element in `assigned` after the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has at least 2 elements. To execute the loop again, `assigned` must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`assigned` has at least 3 elements. If there exists an element at index `i` of array `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True. The value of `m` remains the same after the execution of the if statement. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after setting `can_form` to True.**
