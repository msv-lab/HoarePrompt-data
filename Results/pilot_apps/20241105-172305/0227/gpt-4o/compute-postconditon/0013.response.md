Postcondition: ***`m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `assigned` set is not empty with the next `x` element, and all other conditions remain the same. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` set, `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
