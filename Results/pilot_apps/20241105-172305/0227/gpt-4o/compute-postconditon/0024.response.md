Example Answer:
`can_form` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The addition of the new element `a[i+1]` to `assigned` does not change with the introduction of `can_form = False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it; `can_form` is False.
Output State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it; `can_form` is False**
