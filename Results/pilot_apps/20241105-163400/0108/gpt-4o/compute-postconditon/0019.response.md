Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, `s` remains a string of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with a length of 26, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is either equal to the length of `target` or the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the corresponding character in `target`. If the loop doesn't execute, `s`, `target`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state. In the if part, if j is equal to the length of target, then target is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
