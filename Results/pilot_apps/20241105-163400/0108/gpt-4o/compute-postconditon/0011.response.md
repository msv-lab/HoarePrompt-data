According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with a length of 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `s` after incrementing, and `j` should be less than the length of `target`. No adjustments need to be made to the values of `s` and `target`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with a length of 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`**.
