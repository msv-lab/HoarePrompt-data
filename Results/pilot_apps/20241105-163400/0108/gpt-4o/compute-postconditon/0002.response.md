Example Answer:
The variable `target_len` is assigned the length of the string `target`, which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Since the length of this string is 26 characters, `target_len` will be 26. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string consisting of small English letters, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is 26.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of small English letters, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is 26**
