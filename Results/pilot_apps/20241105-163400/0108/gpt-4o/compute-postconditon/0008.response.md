Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with a length of 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with a length of 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1**
