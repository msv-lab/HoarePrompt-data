Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates over the input string and matches it with the target alphabet sequence. If the entire sequence is matched, it prints the target alphabet sequence. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program covers all potential cases as it checks for an exact match with the target sequence. The logic is sound and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the program.
