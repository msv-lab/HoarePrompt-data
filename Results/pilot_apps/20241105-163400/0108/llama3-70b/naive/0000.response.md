Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an input string `s` and iterates over each character in the English alphabet. For each character, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`, and if so, it replaces that character with the next character in the alphabet. This process continues until all characters in the alphabet have been processed. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (indicating that all characters in the alphabet have been included), it prints the resulting string. Otherwise, it prints -1.

This program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic implemented in the program ensures that it will find the necessary characters to form the English alphabet subsequence. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
