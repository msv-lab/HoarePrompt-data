According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, and `s` will have `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet after it. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the new `char` value must be in the updated `s` value.
State: **`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`**
