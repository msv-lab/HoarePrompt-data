According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, `res` has the newly appended character. The loop can execute one more time if the character that comes after the current `char` is present in the modified `s`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `char` in `s` needs to be replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet.
State: **`s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
