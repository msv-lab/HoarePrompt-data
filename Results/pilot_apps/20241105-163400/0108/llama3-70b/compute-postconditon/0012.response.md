According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` should be the character that comes before the last character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the character before `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
