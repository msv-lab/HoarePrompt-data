According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. The loop can execute again if `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, and `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character after the previous `char` should be present in `s`.
State: **`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the character after the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`**
