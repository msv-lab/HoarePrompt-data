Example Answer:
The value of `char` is appended to the end of `res`, so `res` now contains the newly appended character. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, `res` has the newly appended characters, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
