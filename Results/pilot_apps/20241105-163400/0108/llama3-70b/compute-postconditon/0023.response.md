According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, which means the character `char` still exists in `s`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the `res` having the newly appended character.
State: **`s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
