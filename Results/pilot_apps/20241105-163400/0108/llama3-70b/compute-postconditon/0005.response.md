Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the `alphabet`. The replaced character is then stored in `res`. Since the `replace` method only affects the first occurrence, the length of the string remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5; `res` is a string with the appended character; `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5; `res` is a string with the appended character; `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
