Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet after `char`. The previous values of `res` and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`**
