Example Answer:
The character `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The number of replacements is set to 1. The `res` variable will contain the appended characters in each iteration. The `char` variable is updated to be the next character in the alphabet after the last `char` found in `s`. The `alphabet` variable remains defined and not empty.

Output State: **If `char` is found in `s`, `res` will contain the appended characters in each iteration, `s` will have `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last `char` found in `s`.**
