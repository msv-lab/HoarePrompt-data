Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced in string `s` with the character one position ahead in the alphabet using `replace()` method. The `char` variable is replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, so if `char` was 'a', it will be replaced with 'b'. The `replace()` method replaces the first occurrence only, as specified by the `1` argument. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one more character from the `alphabet`, `res` has the appended character from the last iteration, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one more character from the `alphabet`, `res` has the appended character from the last iteration, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
