Example Answer: 
`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, and `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`. The current value of `char` is unknown, so the output state is: `res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`**
