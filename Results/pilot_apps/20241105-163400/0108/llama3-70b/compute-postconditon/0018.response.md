Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is known to have at least one more character from the alphabet. After appending `char`, the output state is: `s` contains at least one more character from the alphabet, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one more character from the alphabet, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
