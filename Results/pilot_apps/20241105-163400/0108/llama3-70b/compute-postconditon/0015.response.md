Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The string `res` now contains the appended character. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one more character from the `alphabet`, `res` has the appended character from the last iteration, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one more character from the `alphabet`, `res` has the appended character from the last iteration, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
