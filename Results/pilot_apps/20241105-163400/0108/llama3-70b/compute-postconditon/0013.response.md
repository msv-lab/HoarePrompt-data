Output State: **If the string `s` contains at least one character in the `alphabet`, `res` will be a string with the appended character, `s` will have the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet and `alphabet` will remain defined and not empty. If `s` does not contain any character from the `alphabet`, the loop won't execute, leaving `res` as an empty string and `s` unchanged.**
