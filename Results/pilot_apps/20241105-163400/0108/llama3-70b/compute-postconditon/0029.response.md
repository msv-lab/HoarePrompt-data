Example Answer:
`res` will have `char` appended to it. The previous state of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` will have `char` appended to whatever it had before. Since `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last `char` found in `s`, and `s` will have `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, the specific values of `res` and `s` cannot be determined.
Output State: **`res` will have `char` appended to its previous value, `s` will have `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet after it**
