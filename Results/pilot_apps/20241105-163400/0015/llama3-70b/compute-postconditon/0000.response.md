Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. The input is expected to have three integers separated by spaces. After execution, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold these integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
