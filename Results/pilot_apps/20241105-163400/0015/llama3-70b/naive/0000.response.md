Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c = 0, then the sequence will contain only the element a repeated infinitely. So, if a equals b, then "YES" will be printed which is correct. If a does not equal b, then "NO" will be printed which is also correct.
2. If c is not equal to 0, then the difference between b and a must be a multiple of c and the result must be greater than or equal to 0 for b to appear in the sequence. This logic is correctly implemented in the code.
