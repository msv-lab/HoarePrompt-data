Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. The program ensures that the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative.***
