According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`, specifically `i` needs to be less than `k - 1`.
State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation**
