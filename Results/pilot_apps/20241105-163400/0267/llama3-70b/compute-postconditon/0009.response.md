According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1. Since `k` being greater than 1 ensures that the loop will execute again, no adjustments need to be made to `k`. However, `i` needs to be updated to the next value for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
