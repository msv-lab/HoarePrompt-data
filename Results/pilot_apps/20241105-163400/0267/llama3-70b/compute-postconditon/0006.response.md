Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is assigned 9, but there is no information provided about the initial values of n and k. If k is 0, the function returns 0. In all other cases, if the pair (n, k) is in dp, the function returns dp[n, k]. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
Output State: **No specific action is taken**
