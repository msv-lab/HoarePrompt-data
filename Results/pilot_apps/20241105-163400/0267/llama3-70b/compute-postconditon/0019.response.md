The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` and `k` are integers, and `dp` is a dictionary storing key-value pairs where the keys are tuples of integers (n, k) and the values are integers.

In Case 1, if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

In Case 2, if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If (n, k) is in dp, the function returns dp[n, k]. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

In Case 3, if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If (n, k) is in dp, the function returns dp[n, k]. Otherwise, if `n` is less than 10 to the power of `k`, dp[n, k] is set to `n`. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is calculated based on a formula involving nested loops and arithmetic operations. The final value of dp[n, k] is stored modulo MOD. The program handles all edge cases, including when `k` is 0, `n` is less than 10 to the power of `k`, and all other cases where dp[n, k] is computed based on the provided formula.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `n`, `k`, and `dp`, and based on the cases mentioned, it either returns 0, retrieves a value from the dictionary dp, or calculates and stores a new value in dp based on the given conditions and formula.
