Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` are used in the calculation, but their initial values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is greater than 1, and `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, and `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula provided**
