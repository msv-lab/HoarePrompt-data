Functionality: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the tuple `(n, k)` is in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, if `n` is less than `10` to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. In all other cases, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on a formula involving nested loops and arithmetic operations. The final value of `dp[n, k]` is stored modulo `MOD`. The program handles all edge cases, including when `k` is 0, `n` is less than `10` to the power of `k`, and all other cases where `dp[n, k]` is computed based on the provided formula.
