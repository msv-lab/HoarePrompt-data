According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Since no specific action is taken before the loop starts, we need to ensure that k is greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1.
State: **`k` is greater than 1**
