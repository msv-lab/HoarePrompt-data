Example Answer: 
The program calculates the result of `(func2(r, k, dp) - func2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD` and returns it. The values of `r`, `l`, and `k` are used as parameters for the function `func2()`, which updates the dictionary `dp`. Since the initial state of `dp` is an empty dictionary, the function calls will update `dp` during execution. The final result will be the difference of the values returned by `func2(r, k, dp)` and `func2(l - 1, k, dp)`, modulo `MOD`. 
Output State: **`dp` is a dictionary updated during the execution of the functions, and the final result of the expression is returned after calculation**
