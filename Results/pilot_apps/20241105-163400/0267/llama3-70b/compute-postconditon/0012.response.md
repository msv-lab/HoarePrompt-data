Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value. The values of `k` and `i` are initially equal, and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation**
