Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial state mentions that `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is the next value after the last iteration. Since the specific values of `k` and `i` are not provided, the output state after running this code is: `k` is greater than 1, `i` is the next value after the last iteration, and `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is the next value after the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation**
