Output State: **MOD is 998244353. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. In all other cases not covered, the function checks if (n, k) is in dp. If it is, the function returns dp[n, k]. Otherwise, if n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is calculated based on the given formula involving nested loops and arithmetic operations. The final value of dp[n, k] is stored modulo MOD. The program handles all edge cases, including when k is 0, n is less than 10 to the power of k, and all other cases where dp[n, k] is computed based on the provided formula.**
