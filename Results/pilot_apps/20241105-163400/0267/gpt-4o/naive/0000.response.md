Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits and prints the result modulo $998244353$. The function `contains_at_most_k_unique_digits` correctly checks if a number contains at most $k$ unique digits, and the function `sum_of_numbers_with_k_unique_digits` correctly calculates the total sum of numbers meeting the criteria. The program reads the input, calculates the result, and prints it, following the provided problem description. 

I have reviewed the program and all the examples provided in the problem description, and the program works correctly for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
