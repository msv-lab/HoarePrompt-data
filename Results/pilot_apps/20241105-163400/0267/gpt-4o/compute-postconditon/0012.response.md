Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is updated with the new calculated value.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated with the new calculated value**
