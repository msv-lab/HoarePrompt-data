According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to the remainder of the sum of `total_sum` and `num` divided by MOD. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` should be `num + 1`, and `num + 1` should still be less than or equal to `r`. If `func(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` should be updated as described.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l + 1**.
