Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and `MOD` are integers. The loop iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive. If `func(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and no changes occur to the variables. The function returns `total_sum`.**
