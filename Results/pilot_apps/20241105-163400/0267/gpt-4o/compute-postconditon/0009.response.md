Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is `l + 1`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, the updated `total_sum` value is `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`. The states of `l` and `r` remain the same.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` remains unchanged at `l + 1`**
