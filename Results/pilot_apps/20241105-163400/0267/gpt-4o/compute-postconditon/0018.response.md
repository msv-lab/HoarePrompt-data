Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters l, r, and k, iterates through the range of numbers from l to r inclusive. For each number in the range, it calls func(num, k) and if the result is true, it updates total_sum by adding the number and taking the modulo of MOD. If l is greater than r, the loop does not execute. The function then returns the final total_sum.**
