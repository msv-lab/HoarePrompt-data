Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratio. It considers the minimum number of each fruit that can be used to maintain the ratio, and then calculates the total number of fruits accordingly. Additionally, the program handles cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote by setting the output to 0 in such cases. The logic is sound and the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
