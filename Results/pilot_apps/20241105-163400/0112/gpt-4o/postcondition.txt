*`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. `cubes` represents the faces of n number of cubes, with each cube having 6 faces with integers from 0 to 9. `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace. If n is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains sublists of length 6 from `data`, `index` is incremented by 6 after each iteration, `i` is the current iteration index. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `cubes` remains an empty list, `index` remains 1. The function `func` is called with `n` and `cubes`, and the output is printed.
