According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 20, `i` is 2, `cubes` contains the appended sublist from index 7 to index 13 and the sublist from index 14 to index 19 of `data`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 20, `i` is 3, `cubes` contains the appended sublist from index 7 to index 13 and the sublist from index 14 to index 19 of `data**.
