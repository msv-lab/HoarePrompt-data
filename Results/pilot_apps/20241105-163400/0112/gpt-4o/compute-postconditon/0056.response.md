Example Answer:
The sublist from index 14 to index 19 of `data` is appended to the `cubes` list. Since `index` is 14, the sublist appended is `data[14:20]`. The value `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 14, `i` is 2, `cubes` contains the appended sublist from index 7 to index 13 and the sublist from index 14 to index 19 of `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 14, `i` is 2, `cubes` contains the appended sublist from index 7 to index 13 and the sublist from index 14 to index 19 of `data`**
