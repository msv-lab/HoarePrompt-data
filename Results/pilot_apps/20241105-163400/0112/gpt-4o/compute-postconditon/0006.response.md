Example Answer:
`used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`, where `i` is the index of the element to be updated. The list `used_cubes` is updated at index `i` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with one element set to `True`, `found` is `False`, `n` is at least 1.
Output State: **`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with one element set to `True`, `found` is `False`, `n` is at least 1**
