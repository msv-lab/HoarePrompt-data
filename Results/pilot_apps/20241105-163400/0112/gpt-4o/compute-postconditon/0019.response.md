Postcondition: ***`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements. After the execution of the if statement, if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` exists in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. This condition holds true for all `i` less than `n`.***
