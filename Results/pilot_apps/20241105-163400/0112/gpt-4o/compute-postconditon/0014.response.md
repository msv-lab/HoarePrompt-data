Postcondition: ***`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is set to True if not already set to True and the condition is met, `found` is True after the if statement executes, `n` is at least 1, and the condition specified in the if statement is not met for the `i`-th element. If the condition is satisfied, the `i`-th element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop is exited. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
