Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. `cubes` represents the faces of n number of cubes, with each cube having 6 faces with integers from 0 to 9. The function then iterates through the digits of a given number `num`, checks if each digit is present in any of the cubes' faces, and sets elements in `used_cubes` to True accordingly. If all elements are already True or if `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute. Additionally, if `func2(x)` is true for x, x will be incremented by consecutive triangular numbers after each iteration of the loop. If `func2(x)` is false for x, the loop will not execute, and x will remain unchanged. The function returns the final value of x.**
