According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` string. If `digits` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the important states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `digits` has at least 1 character
- `digit` is the first character in the `digits` string
- `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube
- `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`

State: **`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False**.
