Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` converted to an integer. The value of `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold the integer value of the first element of the list `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is an integer value of the first element of `data`**
