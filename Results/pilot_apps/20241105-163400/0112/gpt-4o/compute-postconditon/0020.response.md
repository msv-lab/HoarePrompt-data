According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements. After the execution of the if statement, if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` exist in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. This condition holds true for all `i` less than `n.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `digits` should still have at least 1 character
- `digit` should still be the first character in `digits`
- `cube_faces` should still contain unique integers of corresponding cubes
- `used_cubes` should still be a list of `n` elements
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than the current `n` value
- `i` should be adjusted to be incremented by 1

State: **`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `n` is greater than the current `n` value, `i` is incremented by 1**
