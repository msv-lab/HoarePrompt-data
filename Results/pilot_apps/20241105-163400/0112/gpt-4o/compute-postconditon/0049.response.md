According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 0 since the loop starts from 0. Additionally, `cubes` being an empty list is already suitable for the loop.
State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` is an empty list, `index` is 1, `i` is 0**
