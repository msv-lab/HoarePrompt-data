According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of `func2(x + 1)`. If `func2(x + 1)` evaluates to True, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, variable `x` is increased by 6. This means for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` needs to be adjusted by subtracting 6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `x` is increased by 6 and needs to be decreased by 6**
