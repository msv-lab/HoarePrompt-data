According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is set to True if not already set to True and the condition is met, `found` is True after the if statement executes, `n` is at least 1, and the condition specified in the if statement is not met for the `i`-th element. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`, so the state that needs adjustment is `i` should be less than `n`.
State: **`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is set to True if not already set to True and the condition is met, `found` is True after the if statement executes, `n` is at least 1, and the condition specified in the if statement is not met for the `i`-th element, `i` is less than `n`**
