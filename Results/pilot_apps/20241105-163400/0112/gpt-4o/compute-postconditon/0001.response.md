Example Answer:
Each digit of `num` is converted to a string and stored in the list `digits`. The previous value of `num` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: Each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` contains the string representation of `num`.
Output State: **Each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` contains the string representation of `num`**
