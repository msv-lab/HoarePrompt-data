According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 13, `i` is 1, and `cubes` appends a sublist from index 7 to index 13 of `data`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `index` needs to be adjusted to 14, and `i` needs to be incremented to 2 since it is currently 1.
