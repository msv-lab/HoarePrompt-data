Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts user input, which is then split based on whitespace and stored in the list variable `data`. Since no variables are affected before this code, the output state is simply `data` is a list containing the user input values split by whitespace.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the user input values split by whitespace**
