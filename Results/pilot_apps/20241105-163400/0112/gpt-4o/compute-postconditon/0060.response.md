Output State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains sublists of length 6 from `data`, `index` is incremented by 6 after each iteration, `i` is the current iteration index. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `cubes` remains an empty list, `index` remains 1. The function `func` is called with `n` and `cubes`, and the output is printed.**
