According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `digits` and `digit`. If there are more characters left in `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where some elements may be True based on the conditions met in the loop, `found` is `True` if the condition in the loop is met, `n` is at least 1. If `used_cubes` already has all elements set to True or `digit` is not found in any of the elements in `cube_faces`, then `found` remains `False` after the loop execution. If `found` is not True before the if statement, the function returns False. So for the loop to execute one more time, `digits` should have more than 1 character remaining.
State: **`digits` has at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where some elements may be True based on the conditions met in the loop, `found` is `True` if the condition in the loop is met, `n` is at least 1**.
