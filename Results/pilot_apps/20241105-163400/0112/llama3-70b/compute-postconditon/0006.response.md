Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the set `cube`, converts it to a string, and adds it to the set `digits`. The initial state of `digits` contains string representations of digits from the cube, and `cubes` is a set with at least one cube. After the code execution, the set `digits` is updated with the string representations of digits from the cube set.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
