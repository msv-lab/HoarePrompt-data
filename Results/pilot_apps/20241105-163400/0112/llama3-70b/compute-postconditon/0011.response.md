Example Answer:
The string representation '0' is removed from the `digits` set. The other elements in the set are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes in the `cubes` set except '0'.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes in the `cubes` set except '0'**
