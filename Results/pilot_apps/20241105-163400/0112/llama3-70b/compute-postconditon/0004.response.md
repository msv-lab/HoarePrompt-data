Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the cube set, converts it to a string, and updates the digits set with these string representations of digits. The initial state has `digits` as an empty set and `cubes` as a set with at least one cube. After execution, the `digits` set will contain string representations of digits from the cube. 
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
