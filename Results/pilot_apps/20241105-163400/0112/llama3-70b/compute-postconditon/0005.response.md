According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there is at least one cube in the set `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube. Since `cubes` already has at least one cube, no adjustments need to be made to it. However, the set `digits` containing string representations of digits from the cube does not impact the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted either.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
