Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representation of each digit in the set `cubes`. The `cube` variable iterates over the elements in the set `cubes`, converting each digit to a string and adding it to the set `digits`. As a result, the `digits` set is updated with the string representations of digits from the cube set.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
