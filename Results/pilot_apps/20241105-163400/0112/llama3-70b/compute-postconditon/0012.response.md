Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes in the `cubes` set. If the set `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed from the set. In all cases, `digits` contains string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0'.***
