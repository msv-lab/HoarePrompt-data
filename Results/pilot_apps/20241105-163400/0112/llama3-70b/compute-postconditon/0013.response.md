Example Answer: 
The `digits` set is sorted in reverse order and then joined into a single string, which is converted to an integer and assigned to `max_num`. Since the digits set contains string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0', the largest possible number is formed by concatenating these digits. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0'; `max_num` is the largest number formed by these digits.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0'; `max_num` is the largest number formed by these digits**
