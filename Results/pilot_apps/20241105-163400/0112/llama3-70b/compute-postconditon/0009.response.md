According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are still cubes left in the `cubes` set. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set, and `cubes` is a set with at least one cube. To execute the loop one more time, the `cubes` set should still have cubes remaining, so no adjustment is needed for `cubes`. However, since the loop has already iterated through at least one cube, the `digits` set should be updated to reflect the removal of the digits from the cube that was just processed.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set excluding the digits from the cube that was just processed, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
