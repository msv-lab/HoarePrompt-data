Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input of the side lengths x and y and then calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle of side length x to side length y using the formula provided in the code. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem description. The calculation of the minimum number of seconds required is based on the fact that each side can be reduced by 1 in each second and the total side lengths can be reduced by 3. Therefore, the program is correct and provides the expected output for all cases.
