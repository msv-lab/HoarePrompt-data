Example Answer:
The absolute difference between x and y is printed using the `abs` function. Since x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result of `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
