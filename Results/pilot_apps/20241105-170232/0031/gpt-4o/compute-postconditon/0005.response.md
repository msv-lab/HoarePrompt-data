According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b` being truthy. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have been swapped and `b` is a truthy value. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `b` needs to remain truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is a truthy value**
