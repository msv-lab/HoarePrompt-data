Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value returned by the function `func` with parameters `A` and `B`. The values of `A` and `B` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of p_total.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of p_total**
