Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, otherwise, it remains unchanged. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. A is the updated calculated value of p_shared, and B is the integer division result of dividing the previous value of p_total by `g`. The code then prints the modulo of A with MOD and the modulo of B with MOD.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the updated calculated value of p_shared, B is the integer division result of dividing the previous value of p_total by `g`**
