Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `b` is now assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but `b` is truthy. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is a truthy value.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is a truthy value**
