Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared will be assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or lower, p_no_shared remains unchanged. Since the given code does not affect p_no_shared, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower. p_total is assigned the value of denominator**
