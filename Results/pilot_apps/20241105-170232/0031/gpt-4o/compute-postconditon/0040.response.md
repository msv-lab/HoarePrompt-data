Example Answer:
The function `func2` is called with arguments `n` and `k`. The function executes some code based on the values of `n` and `k`, but without knowing the specific implementation of `func2`, we cannot determine the exact impact on the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input split by space**
