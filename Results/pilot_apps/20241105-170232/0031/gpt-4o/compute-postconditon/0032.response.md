Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, but the values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of p_total.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of p_total**
