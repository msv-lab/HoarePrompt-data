Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters a and b. If the initial value of b is non-zero, a loop will execute where a will hold the initial value of b, and b will hold the remainder of the initial a divided by the initial b. If the initial value of b is zero, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the unchanged value of a while b will be zero. The function returns the final value of a after the loop. **
