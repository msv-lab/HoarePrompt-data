Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the previous value of `b` and the value of `b` is assigned the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. The new values of `a` and `b` are dependent on their previous values, so the output state is: Depends on the new values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **Depends on the new values of `a` and `b`**
