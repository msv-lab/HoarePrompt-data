Example Answer: 
`numerator` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `numerator` is now 1. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1**
