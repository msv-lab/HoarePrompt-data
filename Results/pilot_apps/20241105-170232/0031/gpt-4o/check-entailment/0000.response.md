Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of `k` people having the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days.
- The function `solve` calculates the numerator and denominator based on the provided formula to find the probability.
- The code handles the case where `k` is greater than `2^n` and prints `1 1` as the answer as mentioned in the problem description.
- The code then calculates the probability values `A` and `B`, reduces them to their coprime form, and prints them modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The formula used in the code aligns with the problem description and accurately calculates the probability of shared birthdays.
