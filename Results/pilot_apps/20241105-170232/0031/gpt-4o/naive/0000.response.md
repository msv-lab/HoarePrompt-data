Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The program uses the formula for calculating the probability and handles large numbers by taking modulo 10^6 + 3. The gcd function is used to reduce the fraction to its irreducible form.

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the probability for different values of n and k. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct, hence the program is considered correct.
