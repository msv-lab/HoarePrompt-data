Correctness: False

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the probability incorrectly by multiplying the total_days - i for the numerator and total_days for the denominator in the loop. This approach does not accurately calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. The correct approach should involve calculating the probability of no two people sharing a birthday and subtracting that from 1. The code does not handle this correctly, so it is incorrect.
