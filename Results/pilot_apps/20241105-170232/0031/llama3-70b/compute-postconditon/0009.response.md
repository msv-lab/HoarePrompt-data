According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days`, `denominator` is `total_days^2`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days`, `denominator` is `total_days^2`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
