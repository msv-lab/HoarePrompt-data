According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days^3`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days^3`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
