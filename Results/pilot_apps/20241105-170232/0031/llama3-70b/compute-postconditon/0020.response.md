Output State: **The function accepts two integers n and k, calculates the numerator and denominator based on the values of n and k, finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, updates both numerator and denominator accordingly, and returns the result of numerator modulo (10^6 + 3) and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3). If k is less than 0, the function returns 1 as both the numerator and denominator.**
