Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `i` is 2. The value of `total_days` is a very large number, and `denominator` is `total_days^2`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `numerator` is `numerator * (total_days - i)`. The values of `denominator`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days^2`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
