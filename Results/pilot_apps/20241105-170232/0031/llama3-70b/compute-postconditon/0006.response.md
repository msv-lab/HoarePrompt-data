According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and needs to be incremented for the loop to execute again, the state that needs adjustment is `i` is 1.
State: **`total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `total_days - 1`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
