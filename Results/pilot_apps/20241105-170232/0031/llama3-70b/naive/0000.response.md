Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The logic used in the program is to calculate the numerator and denominator of the probability expression using a loop over the number of people. The GCD is then calculated and the numerator and denominator are divided by the GCD and taken modulo 10^6 + 3. This ensures that the output is in the required format.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the probability for different values of n and k, and the output matches the expected values based on the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
