Example Answer:
Initially, `a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, the new value of `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`. Since `b` is truthy, it means `b` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation, `b` is truthy.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation, `b` is truthy**
