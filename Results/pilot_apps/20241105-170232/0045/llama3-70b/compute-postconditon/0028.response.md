According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. This means the loop can execute again. 

Looking at the initial state, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the element 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and 3. Since `i` is 3, this indicates that the loop has executed at least 3 times.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the element 3 should be appended to `seq` and `n` should be decreased by 3.
2. If `n` is less than 3 but greater than or equal to 2, `seq` should contain the element 2.
3. If `n` is less than 2, `seq` should remain an empty list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the elements based on the conditions mentioned above, `i` is 3**
