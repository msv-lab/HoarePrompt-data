Example Answer:
An empty list `seq` is initialized. Since the list is empty, there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and an empty list `seq` is initialized.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and an empty list `seq` is initialized**
