Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is a list containing the element 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `seq` is an empty list. The value of `n` is updated based on the initial input. The value of `i` is 2. If `n` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
