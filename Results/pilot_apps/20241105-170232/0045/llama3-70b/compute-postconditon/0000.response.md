Example Answer: 
The values of a and b are swapped, and a is assigned the value of b, while b is assigned the value of the remainder of a divided by b. The previous values of a and b are unknown, so the output state is: a and b are updated based on the swapping and modulo operation.
Output State: **a and b are updated based on the swapping and modulo operation**
