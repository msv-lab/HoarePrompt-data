Example Answer: 
`n` is decremented by the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `n` is unknown, so the updated value of `n` depends on the initial input value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated based on the initial input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the element 2, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is updated based on the initial input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the element 2, and `i` is 2**
