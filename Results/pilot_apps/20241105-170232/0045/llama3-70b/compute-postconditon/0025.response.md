Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is decremented by `i`, where `i` is 3. If the initial value of `n` is `x`, then after execution, `n` will be `x - 3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is [2, 3], `i` is 3, and `n` is decremented by 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is [2, 3], `i` is 3, `n` is decremented by 3**
