Example Answer:
The value of `i` which is 2 is appended to the list `seq`, so `seq` now contains the element 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer input minus 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the element 2, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input minus 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains the element 2, and `i` is 2**
