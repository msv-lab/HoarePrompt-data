According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` evaluates to true. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is truthy. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `b` still evaluates to true after the updates in the loop body. 
Since `a` and `b` have been updated based on swapping and modulo operation, we need to ensure that the new values of `a` and `b` still satisfy the condition for `b` to be truthy.
State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation, and `b` still evaluates to true**
