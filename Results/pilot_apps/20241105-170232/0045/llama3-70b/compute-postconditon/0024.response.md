Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `seq`, which contains the element 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `seq` is an empty list. Since `n` is not mentioned and `i` is 3, the list `seq` will contain [2, 3]. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is [2, 3], `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is [2, 3], `i` is 3**
