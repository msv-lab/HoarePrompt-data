Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. If `b` is truthy, it means it is not equal to 0, so the modulo operation is valid. After the operation, `a` will have the value of the original `b`, and `b` will have the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation, `b` is truthy.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the swapping and modulo operation, `b` is truthy**
