According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first integer input minus 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, an empty list `seq` is initialized, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is the first integer input minus 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, an empty list `seq` is initialized, and `i` is 2**
