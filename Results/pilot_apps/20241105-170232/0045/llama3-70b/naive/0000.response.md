Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program loops through from 1 to k and appends the numbers to the sequence while decrementing n by the number added. This ensures a strictly increasing sequence with sum equal to n. If at any point, the number i is greater than n, it breaks out of the loop and prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence. The logic covers all potential cases and accurately follows the problem description.
