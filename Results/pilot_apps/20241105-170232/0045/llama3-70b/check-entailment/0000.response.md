Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the input values of `n` and `k`, checks if `n` is less than `k`, and prints -1 in that case. It then creates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers with the sum equal to `n` and the maximum possible greatest common divisor. The sequence is formed by adding consecutive integers starting from 1 until `n` is reached, and if the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints -1. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the program behaves as expected for all valid inputs.
