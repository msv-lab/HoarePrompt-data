Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not always provide the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD) as mentioned in the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input:
Input
6 3

The expected output should be [1, 2, 3] as the sum is 6 and the GCD is maximized. However, the program may output [2, 2, 2] which does not have the maximum possible GCD. 

Therefore, the program does not work as expected in all cases and hence the correctness is False.
