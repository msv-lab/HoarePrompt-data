Example Answer: 
`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is calculated based on the given formula. Therefore, the Output State is: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `d` is assigned the result of `n // min_sum`.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `d` is assigned the result of `n // min_sum**
