Example Answer:
The function `func` is called with arguments `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input after splitting them. The function `func` processes these values and returns a result. The state of `n` and `k` after the function call is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, and the result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, and the result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`**
