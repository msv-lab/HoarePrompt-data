Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`, `i` are positive integers. `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop terminates. The program handles all edge cases involving the calculation of `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` ensuring the correctness of the sequence values and the proper termination of the loop.***
