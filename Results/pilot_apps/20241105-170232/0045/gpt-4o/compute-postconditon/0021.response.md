According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and if `remainder` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, `i` are positive integers. `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be decremented by 1 because the loop is iterating from `k - 1` to 0.
- If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the loop will continue. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop will terminate.

State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, `i - 1` are positive integers, `remainder` is not equal to 0**
