Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the result of `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`. `remainder` is assigned the result of `n - d * min_sum`. Then, `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a sequence based on the values of `d` and `k`. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`**
