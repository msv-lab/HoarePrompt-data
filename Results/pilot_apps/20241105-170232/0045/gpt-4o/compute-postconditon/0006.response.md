According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. In this case, before the loop starts, all the variables are already correctly set and do not need any adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`**
