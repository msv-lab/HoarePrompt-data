Example Answer:
The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is a positive integer. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
