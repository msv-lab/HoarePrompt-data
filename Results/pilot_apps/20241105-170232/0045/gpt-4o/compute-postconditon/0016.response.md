According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 3`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`, `i` is equal to `k - 3` and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `remainder` is decremented by 1**
