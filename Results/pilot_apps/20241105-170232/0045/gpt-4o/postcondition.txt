*`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, and the result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`. If the result is -1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the elements of `result` are printed as strings separated by a space. This postcondition covers all possible cases where the program assigns values to `n` and `k`, calculates the result, and prints either -1 or the elements of `result` as described.
