Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the minimum sum of the first k natural numbers which should be less than or equal to n. If it is greater than n, then it returns -1.
- It then calculates the maximum possible GCD which is n divided by the minimum sum.
- The code then creates a sequence of k numbers with a common difference of the calculated GCD and distributes any remainder to make the sum equal to n.
- The code handles the case where there might not be a valid sequence by returning -1.
- The output hints also agree with the code by mentioning that the resulting sequence should have a maximum GCD and that -1 should be output if there is no possible sequence.
- The code considers all possible scenarios as per the problem description, hence it is correct for all cases.
