Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values and stores them in appropriate variables.
- It sorts the buy and sell opportunities in ascending and descending order respectively.
- It then iterates through the buy opportunities, buying as many shares as possible until the remaining funds are not sufficient.
- Next, it iterates through the sell opportunities, selling all the bought shares at the highest possible price.
- Finally, it prints the remaining funds after all transactions.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
