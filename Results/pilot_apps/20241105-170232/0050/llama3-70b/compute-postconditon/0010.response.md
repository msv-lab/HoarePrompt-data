Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated to include the division result of r divided by s[i], and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. `i` is then incremented by 1. If r < s[i], `shares` remains at 0 and `i` remains at 0, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
