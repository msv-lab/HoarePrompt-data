Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values input by the user after splitting them into integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `s` is a list containing integers input by the user.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `s` is a list containing integers input by the user**
