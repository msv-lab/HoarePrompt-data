Postcondition: ***`shares`, `r`, `i` are integers. If shares is greater than 0, then `r` is updated to the sum of the current value of `r` and the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0, while `i` is incremented by 1. If shares is not greater than 0, then shares, r, and i are all set to 0. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, m should be greater than 1.***
