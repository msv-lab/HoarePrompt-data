Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order, `i` is one more than the last value based on the loop conditions described. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], the loop breaks and the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are maintained without any changes.***
