Output State: **If r is less than s[0] the loop does not execute, shares remains 0, r remains the same, i remains 0, m is at least 1. 
If r is greater than or equal to s[0], the loop calculates shares as the sum of integer divisions of r by elements in s up to the point where r is less than the current element in s. r is then updated to the remainder of the division by the last element checked. If shares is greater than 0, r is updated by the product of shares and b[i], shares is then set to 0, and i is incremented by 1. If shares is not greater than 0, shares, r, and i are set to 0. The loop will continue executing as long as m is greater than the current value of i.**
