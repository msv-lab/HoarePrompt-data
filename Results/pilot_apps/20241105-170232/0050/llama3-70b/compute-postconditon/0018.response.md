Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order, `i` is one more than the last value based on the loop conditions described, and `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.**
