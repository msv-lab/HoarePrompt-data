Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts an input and splits it based on spaces, `int` converts each part to an integer, and `map` applies this conversion to all parts. Since the values are constrained to be positive integers within certain ranges, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
