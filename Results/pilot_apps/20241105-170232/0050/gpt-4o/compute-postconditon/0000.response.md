Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are now determined based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input**
