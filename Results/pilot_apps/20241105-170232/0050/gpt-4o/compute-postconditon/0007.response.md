Example Answer:
The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. The values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are known based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` contains the maximum number of shares that can be bought, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` contains the maximum number of shares that can be bought, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`**
