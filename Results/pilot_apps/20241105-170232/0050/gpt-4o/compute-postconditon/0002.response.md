Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the input string of integers split by space to integers. The values of `b` are directly dependent on the input provided, and the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, and `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, and `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input**
