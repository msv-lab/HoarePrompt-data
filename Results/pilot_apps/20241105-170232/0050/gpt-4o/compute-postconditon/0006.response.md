Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`, where `r` is divided by `min_buy_price`. The value of `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`. Therefore, `max_shares` will contain the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available balance. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` contains the maximum number of shares that can be bought**
