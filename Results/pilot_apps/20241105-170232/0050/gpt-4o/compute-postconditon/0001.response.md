Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input**
