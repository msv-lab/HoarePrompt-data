Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly follows the problem description by first reading the input values, then finding the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, and if so, prints the current bourles. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the current bourles, the remaining bourles after buying shares, and the total bourles after selling all shares at the maximum sell price. The logic implemented in the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Hence, the program is correct.
