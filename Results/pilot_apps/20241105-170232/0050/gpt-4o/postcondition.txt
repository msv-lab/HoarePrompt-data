*`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers assigned based on the input, `s` contains the list of integers from the input, `b` contains the list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The value of `total_bourles` is printed.
