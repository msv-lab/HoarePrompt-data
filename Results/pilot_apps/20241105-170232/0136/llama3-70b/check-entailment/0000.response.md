Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings and removes any leading zeros. Then it compares the two numbers and prints the corresponding symbol '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison, following the problem description.

The code correctly handles the cases where `a < b`, `a > b`, and `a = b`. Additionally, the code accounts for cases where the numbers have leading zeros and still provides the correct comparison result. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
