Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly reads two very long integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them as required by the problem description. The logic used to compare the numbers and print the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") is correct and covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. 

The program handles cases where a is less than b, a is greater than b, and a is equal to b. It also considers cases where the input numbers contain leading zeroes and removes them before comparison. 

Therefore, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program is correct.
