Example Answer:
The input is accepted and leading zeros are stripped from it using the `lstrip` function, and the result is stored in variable `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but it is guaranteed that they are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros**
