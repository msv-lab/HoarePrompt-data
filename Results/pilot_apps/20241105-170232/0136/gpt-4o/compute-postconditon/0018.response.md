Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values, removes leading zeros from the first two values, and compares them. It then prints '<' if the first value is less than the second, '>', if the first value is greater, and '=' if they are equal. This comparison is done after handling cases where one or both values have leading zeros. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on input values.**
