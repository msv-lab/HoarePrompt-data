Example Answer: 
The value at index 0 of the list `data` is extracted and leading zeros are stripped using the `lstrip` method. If the value at index 0 is '012', it will become '12'. The original list `data` is not modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list containing the input values and `a` is the value at index 0 with leading zeros stripped.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input values, `a` is the value at index 0 with leading zeros stripped**
