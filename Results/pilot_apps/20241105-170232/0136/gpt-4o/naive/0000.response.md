Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly reads two large integers a and b from input and compares them based on the number of digits and the actual numerical values. It handles cases where the input integers may contain leading zeros by stripping them before comparison. The if-elif-else block correctly determines whether a is less than, greater than, or equal to b, and prints the corresponding symbol ("<", ">", or "=") accordingly. The program also correctly handles the case where both a and b are zero. The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description, and for all potential cases provided in the examples, the program produces the correct output.
