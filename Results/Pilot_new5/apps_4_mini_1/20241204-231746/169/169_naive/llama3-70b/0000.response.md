Correctness: **False**.

The provided program fails to correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations described in the problem. 

Specifically, the logic used to determine the output is flawed. The program checks if the count of minus operations (`-`) is greater than the count of plus operations (`+`). If it is, it outputs `0`, which is incorrect. The logic should instead account for how many stones need to have been present initially to allow for all the `-` operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
The expected output is `0`, which is handled correctly. However, for the input:
```
3
--+
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct output should also be `1` since starting with 1 stone allows for 2 `-` operations and then 1 `+`.

However, consider the input:
```
4
-++
```
Here, the correct number of stones after the operations must account for starting with at least one stone, leading to the output being `2`. The program would incorrectly interpret this and return `1`, which is wrong.

The program does not handle cases correctly where there are more `-` operations than `+` operations in a balanced way, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem requirements accurately in all scenarios.
