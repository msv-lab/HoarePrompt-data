Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. Here is the reasoning for why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which denotes the number of operations, followed by a string `s` consisting of `n` characters ('+' and '-') that represent the operations performed by Vasya. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Stone Calculation Logic**: The program initializes a counter `stones` to zero. It then iterates through each operation in the string `s`:
   - If the operation is '+', it increments the `stones` counter by 1, which reflects adding a stone to the pile.
   - If the operation is '-', it decrements the `stones` counter by 1, but it ensures that `stones` never goes below zero using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This is important because the problem states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. Therefore, if the `stones` counter would go negative (which means Vasya would have taken a stone while the pile was empty), the program correctly prevents this by clamping it to zero.

3. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `stones`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones remaining in the pile after all operations have been executed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases as described in the examples:
   - If all operations are '-', the stones will be clamped to zero if Vasya starts with an insufficient number of stones.
   - If all operations are '+', the total number of stones will simply equal the number of '+' operations.
   - Mixed operations are handled correctly too, ensuring that at no point does the number of stones go negative.

Overall, the program adheres to the constraints and requirements set forth in the problem description, maintaining correctness for all valid input cases within the defined parameters.
