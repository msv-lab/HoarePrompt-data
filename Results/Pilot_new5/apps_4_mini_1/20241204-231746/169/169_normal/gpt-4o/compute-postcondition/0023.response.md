The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on two constraints: `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters '+' and '-'. After executing the function body, it processes the string `s` to produce a numerical result based on the operations represented by the characters in `s`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a string `s` of operations, where each character denotes an operation performed by Vasya, and returns a numerical result based on these operations. 

Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' operations, returning a numerical result based on these operations.**
