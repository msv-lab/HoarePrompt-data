The variable `stones` is assigned the value of `0`. The other variables, `n` and `s`, retain their previous conditions: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-' and `s` is an input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'; `stones` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'; `stones` is 0.**
