Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of symbols "-" and "+". It counts the occurrences of each symbol and prints `0` if there are more "-" symbols than "+" symbols. If there are equal or more "+" symbols than "-", it prints the difference between the count of "+" and "-" symbols. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
