Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly. 

For example, consider the input:

```
4
--++
```

According to the problem description, if Vasya starts with 2 stones, after performing the operations he would have 2 stones left (2 - 2 + 2 = 2). However, the program will output `0` since it counts `-` and `+` and assumes the minimal possible stones left should be `0` if the `-` count exceeds `+`. 

This is incorrect because the program should correctly account for the number of operations and the initial stones needed to execute them without going negative. 

The correct logic requires that the program maintains an understanding of the minimum stones that could be there initially to perform all operations, which is not captured correctly in the code.
