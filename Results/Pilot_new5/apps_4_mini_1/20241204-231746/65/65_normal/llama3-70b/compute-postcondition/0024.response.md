The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons. The function processes these inputs and returns the maximum number of balloons that any single friend can get, based on the colors available.
