Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is updated as needed, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that character in `s`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, 'NO' is printed.***
