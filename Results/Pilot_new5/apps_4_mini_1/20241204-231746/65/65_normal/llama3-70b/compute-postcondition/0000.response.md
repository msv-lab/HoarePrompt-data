The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` function after being split and converted to integers. The string `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `k` based on user input while retaining the information about `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an updated positive integer, `k` is an updated positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.**
