The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input representing the colors of the balloons. The length of this string will be equal to `n`, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are only used to represent the number of balloons and friends.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive representing the number of balloons, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive representing the number of friends, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet with length equal to `n`**.
