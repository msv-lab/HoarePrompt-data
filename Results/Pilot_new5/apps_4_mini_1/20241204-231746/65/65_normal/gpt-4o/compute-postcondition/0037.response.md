Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary with counts of occurrences of each unique character from `s`. If `can_distribute` is True, all counts in `color_count` are less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `can_distribute` is False, at least one count in `color_count` is greater than `k.***
