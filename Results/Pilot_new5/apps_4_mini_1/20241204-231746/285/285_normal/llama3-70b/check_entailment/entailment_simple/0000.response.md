Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial game-coins (denoted by `n`) on houses, cars, and computers as specified in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works and why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents Kolya's game-coin score.

2. **Iterating over Possible Purchases**: 
   - It uses two nested loops to iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`).
   - The outer loop iterates `a` from `0` to the maximum number of houses he could buy with `n` game-coins, calculated as `n // 1234567`, where `1234567` is the cost of one house.
   - The inner loop iterates `b` from `0` to the maximum number of cars he could buy with the remaining coins after buying `a` houses, calculated as `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`, where `123456` is the cost of one car.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Coins for Computers**: 
   - The number of computers (`c`) is calculated from the remaining coins after buying `a` houses and `b` cars. The computation ensures that `c` is a non-negative integer by using integer division.

4. **Condition Check**: 
   - The program checks if the total spent coins (`a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`) equals `n`. If they are equal, it prints "YES" and exits the function, indicating that it is possible to spend all coins exactly as described.

5. **Final Output**: 
   - If the loops complete without finding such a combination, it prints "NO", meaning it is not possible to spend all coins exactly.

**Conclusion**: The program is correct because it exhaustively checks all combinations of purchases for houses, cars, and computers to see if their total cost can match `n`. It adheres to the problem's requirements and handles all potential cases within the given constraints. Thus, it meets the expectations set by the problem description, ensuring the correctness of the implementation.
