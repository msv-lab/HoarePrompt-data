The code snippet `print('YES')` does not change any variables or their values; it simply prints the string 'YES'. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is (n - 123456) // 1234.**
