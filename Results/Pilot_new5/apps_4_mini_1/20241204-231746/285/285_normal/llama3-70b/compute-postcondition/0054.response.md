Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 1234567, `a` is 2, `b` is at most `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456`, `c` is at least 0 and up to `(n - 2 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. If the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited. If the loop does not execute, then `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234`, and the program terminates without printing 'YES'.**
