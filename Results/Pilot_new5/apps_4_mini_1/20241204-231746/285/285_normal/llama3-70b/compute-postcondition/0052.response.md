The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values. Thus, all the initial states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 2469134, `a` is unchanged, `b` is at least 1 more than its last value, `c` is calculated as `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, and the output is 'YES'.**
