The value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is 1, this simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. 

The initial state specifies that `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, and we know that `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`. Thus, `remaining_after_cars` will be a non-negative number because we are subtracting a value that is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`.

Therefore, the updated variable is:
- `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is 0 to `n // 1234567; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `b` is 1; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
