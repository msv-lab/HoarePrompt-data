According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the conditions surrounding `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. For the loop to execute, the upper limit of the range, which is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, must be greater than 0. 

Given that:

1. `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, it ensures there is a valid value for `car_cost`.
2. `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost` to ensure that the division does not result in zero or negative iterations.

To summarize, if `remaining_after_houses` is at least `car_cost`, the loop will execute at least once. Thus:

- If `remaining_after_houses` is exactly `car_cost`, the loop will execute once (resulting in `b` being 0). 
- If `remaining_after_houses` is greater than `car_cost`, the loop will execute for `b` values from 0 up to the maximum possible based on that division.

Therefore, the adjusted states should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` (must be at least `car_cost`), `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`**.
