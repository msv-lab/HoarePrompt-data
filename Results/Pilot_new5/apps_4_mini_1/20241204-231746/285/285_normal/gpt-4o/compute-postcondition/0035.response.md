To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `for` loop and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop iterates over `a` in `range(n // house_cost + 1)`. This means that the loop will iterate from `0` to `n // house_cost`, inclusive.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is between `0` and `n // house_cost`. Therefore, to execute one more time, the value of `a` must be incremented by `1`.
3. If `a` is currently at the maximum value, which is `n // house_cost`, then for the loop to execute again, `n // house_cost` must be less than `n // house_cost + 1`, which is guaranteed since the loop is designed to run for `n // house_cost + 1` iterations.
4. We will increment `a` by 1 for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, we conclude:
- The current value of `a` must be incremented by `1`.
- The maximum value for `a` that allows another iteration to happen is `n // house_cost` (after incrementing).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- The state will reflect `a` as `1` more than its current value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, and after all iterations of the loop, if any value of `b` results in `remaining_after_cars` being divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'.**
