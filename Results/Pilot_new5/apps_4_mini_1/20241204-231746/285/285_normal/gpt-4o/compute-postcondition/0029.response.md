Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'.***
