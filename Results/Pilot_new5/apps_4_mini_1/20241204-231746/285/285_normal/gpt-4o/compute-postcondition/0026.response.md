According to the code, the loop can execute again if `b` can be incremented. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is at its current value, which must be between `0` and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be incremented by 1, and the upper limit of the range must allow for this increment. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be able to increase to `b + 1`, and therefore the condition for the loop's range implies `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least `b + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`**
