Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0; `car_cost` is a positive integer; `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; if the loop executed, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` for the maximum `b`, and the loop condition checks if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`. The program returns 'YES' if at least one valid configuration is found that satisfies the purchasing conditions.**
