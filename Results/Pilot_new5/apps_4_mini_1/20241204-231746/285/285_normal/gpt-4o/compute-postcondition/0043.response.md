The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, and `b` is 1. Thus, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. The values of `n`, `house_cost`, `a`, `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` are affected.

1. `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`.
2. `remaining_after_cars` will be `remaining_after_houses - car_cost = (n - a * 1234567) - car_cost`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`; `car_cost` is a positive integer; `b` is 1; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567) - car_cost`; `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
