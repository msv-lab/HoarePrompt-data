According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. The loop iterates based on how many cars can be purchased with the remaining amount after buying houses. 

At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * 1234567`, and `b` represents the number of cars being considered for purchase. The loop will execute for values of `b` from 0 up to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased, which is given by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

To execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. If `b` is currently at its maximum (i.e., `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`), then for the loop to execute again, `remaining_after_houses` must allow for at least one more car to be purchased.

Thus, the loop will execute one more time if `b` is currently equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` (the last iteration) and the new value of `b` should be `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. This means that `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost` greater than its current value for the next iteration to be valid, but the relationship of these values must ensure `remaining_after_houses` is still non-negative.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost * (b + 1)` and `b` is currently equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`**
