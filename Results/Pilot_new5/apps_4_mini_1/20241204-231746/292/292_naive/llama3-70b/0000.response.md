Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a loop to increment the years until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The weights are updated correctly: Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year. The initial conditions (a â‰¤ b) are respected, and the termination condition of the loop (a > b) ensures that Limak's weight surpasses Bob's. 

Additionally, the program handles the edge case where both weights are equal (e.g., `1 1`), correctly returning `1` year, as Limak's weight will be `3` and Bob's `2` after one year. All provided examples in the problem description are accounted for, and the program would produce the expected results for these inputs. Thus, the program is correct for all valid inputs within the specified range.
