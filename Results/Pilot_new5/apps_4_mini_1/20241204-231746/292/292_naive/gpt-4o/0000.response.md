Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates Limak and Bob's weights over the years, with Limak's weight tripling and Bob's weight doubling each year. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point the number of years is printed. 

Let's review the possible cases:

1. **Input (4, 7)**: 
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14 (still not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 (now Limak is larger, output is 2).

2. **Input (4, 9)**:
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 (still not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 (still not larger, they are equal)
   - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 (now Limak is larger, output is 3).

3. **Input (1, 1)**:
   - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 (Limak is larger, output is 1).

The code handles all edge cases correctly, including the scenario where both weights start equal, and correctly counts the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. There are no issues with the logic, and all potential inputs within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) are covered correctly. Thus, the program meets all requirements laid out in the problem description.
