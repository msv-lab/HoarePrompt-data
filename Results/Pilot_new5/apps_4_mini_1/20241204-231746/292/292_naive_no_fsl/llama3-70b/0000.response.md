Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the edge case where Limak and Bob start with the same weight. In the problem description, it's stated that Limak wants to become strictly larger than Bob, which means he must weigh more than Bob at the end of the calculation. If both Limak and Bob start with the same weight (e.g., `1 1`), the program enters the while loop, and during the first iteration, Limak's weight becomes `3` and Bob's weight becomes `2`. The program then outputs `1`, which is correct in this specific case. 

However, consider the edge case with the maximum values allowed by the constraints, `10 10`. In this situation, the program would incorrectly output `1` as well. In the first year, Limak would weigh `30` and Bob would weigh `20`, which satisfies the condition. But according to the problem, if they were equal initially, the output should still be `1` to reflect that it takes one year for Limak to exceed Bob's weight.

Moreover, because the problem states Limak's weight is guaranteed to be less than or equal to Bob's weight, and he is looking to become strictly larger, the correct behavior when they are initially equal should still yield a result indicating that it takes one year to become strictly larger.

Thus, the failure of the program to account for this situation means that it does not adhere fully to the problem description.
