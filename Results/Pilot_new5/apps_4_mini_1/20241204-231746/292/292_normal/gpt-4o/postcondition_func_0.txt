The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` that represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. It repeatedly increases Limak's weight by multiplying it by 3 and Bob's weight by multiplying it by 2 until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. It counts the number of years this process takes and prints that count. The function does not handle cases where the input values are outside the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), nor does it validate input types.
