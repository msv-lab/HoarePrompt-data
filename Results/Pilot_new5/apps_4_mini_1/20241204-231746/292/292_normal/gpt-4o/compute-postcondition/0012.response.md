`b` is multiplied by 2. The value of `b` is greater than or equal to 18, so after multiplying, `b` will be at least 36. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must be either 27 or 54; `b` is greater than or equal to 36; `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` must be either 27 or 54; `b` is greater than or equal to 36; `years` is 2**.
