The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. Given the initial state of `a`, which can be either 3, 6, or 9, the possible new values for `a` after the operation will be 9, 18, or 27 respectively. The variable `b` must be at least `2 * a`, but since `b` is not explicitly changed in the code, its relationship with `a` remains valid. The variable `years` is unaffected by the operation.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` is at least `2 * a`; `years` is 1**
