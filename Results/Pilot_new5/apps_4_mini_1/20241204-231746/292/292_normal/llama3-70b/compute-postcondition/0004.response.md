The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. The preconditions state that `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` can be either 3, 6, or 9. Since `a` has specific values (3, 6, or 9), `b` must also have specific values accordingly. Thus, if we consider the possible values for `a`, we can analyze the implications for `b`.

- If `a` is 3, then `b` is at least 3. After doubling, `b` can take values starting from 6 (minimum).
- If `a` is 6, then `b` is at least 6. After doubling, `b` can take values starting from 12 (minimum).
- If `a` is 9, then `b` is at least 9. After doubling, `b` can take values starting from 18 (minimum).

After executing the code, `b` will be updated to either at least 6, 12, or 18 based on the initial value of `b`. The variable `years` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is at least `2 * a`; `years` is 0**
