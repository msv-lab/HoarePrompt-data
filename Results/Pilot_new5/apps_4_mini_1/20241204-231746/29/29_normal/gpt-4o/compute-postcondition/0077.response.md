The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, so after incrementing, `temp_counter` will be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` is now less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be present in `files_set`.
