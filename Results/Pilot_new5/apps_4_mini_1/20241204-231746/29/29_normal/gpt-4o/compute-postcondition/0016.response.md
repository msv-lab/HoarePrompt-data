The code appends the value of `name` (the first element of the `file` tuple) to the `examples` list. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `file` remain unchanged, but `examples` will now contain the `name` of the current `file`. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the next tuple in the list, `name` is the first element of `file`, `type_` is the second element of `file`, and `examples` has `name` appended to it.**
