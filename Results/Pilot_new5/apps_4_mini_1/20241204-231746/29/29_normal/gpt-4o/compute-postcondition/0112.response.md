`regulars[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `regulars[i]`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'**.
