To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` loop.

The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the values of `temp_counter` and `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that after this increment:
- `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`, meaning prior to incrementing, it must have been less than `2 * n`.
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` after the increment. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` is also a positive integer. We also have to ensure that the incremented value of `temp_counter` is still a string representation that exists in `files_set`.

Therefore, we can conclude:
1. We need the updated `temp_counter` to still be less than or equal to `2 * n` after being incremented.
2. We need `str(temp_counter)` to be present in `files_set`.

Thus, for the loop to continue, we can say that:
- `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n` after the increment, which means it must have been at most `2 * n - 1` before the increment.
- Additionally, we do not know the exact contents of `files_set`, but it must be ensured that `str(temp_counter)` is in it after the increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set**.
