`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and `temp_counter` must still adhere to the condition of being less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now one greater than its previous value, but still must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 1 and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
