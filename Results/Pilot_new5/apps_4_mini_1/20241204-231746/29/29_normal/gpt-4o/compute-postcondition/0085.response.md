Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list containing at least one item, `moves` includes the operation `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}` and `move {regulars[0]} {target}` if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. Additionally, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that was not present in `files_set` plus 1, and `i` is 0. If `regulars[i]` equals `str(target)`, no changes are made to `regulars`, `moves`, or `temp_counter`.***
