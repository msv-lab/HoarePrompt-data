The `examples` list is updated to include the value of `name`. The state of the initial variables is still valid, and only `examples` is modified. The values of `n`, `files`, `name`, `type_`, and `regulars` remain unchanged. The impact of the code indicates that `name` is now part of the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the split `file`, `type_` is the second part of the split `file`, `examples` includes `name`, and `regulars` may contain the value of `name` or remain an empty list depending on `type_`.**
