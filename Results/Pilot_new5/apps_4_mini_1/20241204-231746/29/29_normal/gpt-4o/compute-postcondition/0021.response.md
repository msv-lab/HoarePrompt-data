`temp_counter` is assigned the value `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000, `temp_counter` will take a value between 2 and 100001. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing the names of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing the names of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.**
