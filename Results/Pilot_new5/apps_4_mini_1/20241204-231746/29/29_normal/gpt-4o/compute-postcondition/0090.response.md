According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions involving `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop will execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
1. `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to its previous value by 1.
2. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Given that `temp_counter` must remain within these bounds for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n` after this increment, and it must remain in `files_set`.

Therefore, the states can be summarized as follows:
- The condition `temp_counter must be less than or equal to 2 * n` is already satisfied.
- We have no explicit information on whether `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`, so we can't assume it is true. However, we can say that it must hold for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
