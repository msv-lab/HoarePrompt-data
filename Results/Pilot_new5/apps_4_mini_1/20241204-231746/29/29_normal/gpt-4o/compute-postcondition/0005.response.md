The code `examples.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the list `examples`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Since `examples` starts as an empty list, after this operation, it will contain one element, which is the value of `name`. The values of `n`, `files`, `regulars`, and `type_` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `examples` contains `name`, `regulars` is an empty list, `name` and `type_` are obtained from splitting the string `file` into two parts, and `type_` is '1'.**
