Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that contains at least one item, `moves` includes the operations `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}` and `move {regulars[0]} {target}`, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that was not present in `files_set` + 1, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`.**
