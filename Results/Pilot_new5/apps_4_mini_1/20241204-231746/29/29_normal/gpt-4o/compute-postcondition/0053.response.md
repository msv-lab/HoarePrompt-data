According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than the length of the `examples` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently less than the length of `examples` (which is `len(examples)`), allowing for another iteration. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently `i`, it will become `i + 1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i + 1` is less than `len(examples)`, meaning we need to ensure that `len(examples)` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now includes `examples[i + 1]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i + 1]} {temp_counter + 1}'` if `examples[i + 1]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`; otherwise, `moves` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**
