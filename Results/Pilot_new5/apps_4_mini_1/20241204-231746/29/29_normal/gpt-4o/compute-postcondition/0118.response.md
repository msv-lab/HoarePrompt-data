Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list where each element is equal to its corresponding target (all entries are `str(target)`), `moves` contains all the move operations performed, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`, and no additional moves are necessary since all `regulars` have been updated to their final target positions.**
