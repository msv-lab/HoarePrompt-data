The code `moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string contains the name of the file from `regulars` at index `i`, followed by the value of `temp_counter`. 

Given that `i` is 0, `regulars[i]` refers to the first item in the `regulars` list. The value of `temp_counter` is unchanged and is still greater than `2 * n`. 

The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`; `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types; `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position; `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item; `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, including the new entry `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.**
