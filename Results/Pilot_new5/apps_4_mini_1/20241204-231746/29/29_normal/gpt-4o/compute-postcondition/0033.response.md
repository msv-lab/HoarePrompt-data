The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Prior to this operation, `temp_counter` was already greater than `2 * n` and equal to the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` present in `files_set`. The value of `temp_counter` now becomes `temp_counter + 1`. Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state reflects the updated value of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is now greater than `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is equal to the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` plus 1 that was present in `files_set`, `str(temp_counter)` is still not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` now contains the entry `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`, and `examples[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`.**
