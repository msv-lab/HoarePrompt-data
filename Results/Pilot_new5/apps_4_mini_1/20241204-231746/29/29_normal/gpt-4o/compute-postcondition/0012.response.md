Given the initial state, the code `regulars.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the `regulars` list. The `name` variable is derived from the first part of a split file. Since `type_` determines whether `name` is added to `regulars` or not, we assume the state of `regulars` could change based on whether `name` was relevant to `type_`. 

However, since the exact value of `name` is not defined and `regulars` may or may not have contained `name` prior, we cannot specify its previous state but can confirm that `regulars` is updated to include `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the split `file`, `type_` is the second part of the split `file`, `examples` will be updated accordingly, and `regulars` now includes `name`.**
