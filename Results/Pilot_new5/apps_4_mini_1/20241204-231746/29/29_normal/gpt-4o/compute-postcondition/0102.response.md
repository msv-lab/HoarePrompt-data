According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is the index in the `regulars` list. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `regulars`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. Assuming the loop body updates `regulars[i]` and `moves`, `i` would have been incremented by 1 after the last iteration, allowing it to execute one more time if `i` is still less than `len(regulars)`.

Therefore, after the last iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `i` is updated to be the next index (i + 1)**
