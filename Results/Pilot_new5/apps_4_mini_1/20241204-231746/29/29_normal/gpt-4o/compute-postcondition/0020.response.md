The variable `moves` is initialized as an empty list. The initial states of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing the names of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1'; `moves` is an empty list.**
