The value of `regulars[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is a string representation of a number greater than `2 * n`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`; `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types; `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position; `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `regulars[0]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`; `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, including the new entry `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.**
