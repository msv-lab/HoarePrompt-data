According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `regular` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements in the `regular` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(examples) + 2`, which means the loop has already processed at least two elements of `regular`. 

To execute one more time, `regular` must have at least 3 elements in total, and `i` should be updated to `len(examples) + 2 + 1`, which is `len(examples) + 3`. Additionally, `file` will then represent the third element in `regular`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is len(examples) + 3, `file` is the third element in `regular`, and `script` includes the string `move {file} {i}`**
