The variable `name` is assigned a value from the user's input, split into two parts along whitespace. Specifically, `name` will hold the first part of the input, and `type_` will hold the second part. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `_` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updates made to `name` and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is an empty list, `_` will take values from 0 to n-1, `name` is the first part of the user input, `type_` is the second part of the user input.**
