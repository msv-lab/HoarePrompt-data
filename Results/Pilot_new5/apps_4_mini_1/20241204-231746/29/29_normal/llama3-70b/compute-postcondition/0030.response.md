To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code line `print(len(script))`.

1. The variable `script` is built from the strings `move {file} {j}` for each `j` in the range from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`.
2. The length of `script` will equal the number of strings generated, which corresponds to the number of iterations in the range. Specifically, the range starts at `len(examples) + 1` and ends at `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`. This range includes `len(regular)` elements.

Thus, the length of `script` is equal to `len(regular)`.

Since `len(script)` is printed, it does not change any variables but simply outputs the computed length.

Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order
- `examples` is a list derived from `files`
- `regular` may contain elements (the specific number is unknown)
- `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`
- `file` is the last element in `regular`
- `script` now includes the strings `move {file} {j}` for each `j` in range(len(examples) + 1, len(examples) + len(regular) + 1)

After executing `print(len(script))`, the output state remains the same except for the specific calculation of `script` length:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` may contain elements, `i` is len(examples) + len(regular), `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains len(regular) strings.**
