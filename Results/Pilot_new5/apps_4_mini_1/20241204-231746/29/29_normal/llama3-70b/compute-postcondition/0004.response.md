The code appends a tuple consisting of `name` and the integer value of `type_` to the `files` list. The initial state indicates that `files` is currently an empty list. The values of `name` and `type_` are derived from the user input, with `type_` being converted to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `_` is unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing one tuple (name, int(type_)), `_` will take values from 0 to n-1.**
