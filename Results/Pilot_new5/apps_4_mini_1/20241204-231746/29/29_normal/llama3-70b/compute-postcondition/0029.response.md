Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` may contain elements, `i` is len(examples) + len(regular), `file` is the last element in `regular`, and `script` now includes the strings `move {file} {j}` for each j in range(len(examples) + 1, len(examples) + len(regular) + 1).**
