The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of files, then collects `n` tuples containing a filename and its type. It sorts the files based on their type in descending order, creating two separate lists: one for example tests (type "1") and one for regular tests (type "0"). The function generates a sequence of move commands for each file based on their type and prints the total number of commands followed by the commands themselves. There are no return values from the function.
