Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is set to 1 and `i` is 1 if the sum of `i` and `n - i` is divisible by 10 raised to the power of (the length of the string representation of `(i + (n - i))` minus 1). If the condition is not met, `ans` remains 0 and `i` is unchanged.***
