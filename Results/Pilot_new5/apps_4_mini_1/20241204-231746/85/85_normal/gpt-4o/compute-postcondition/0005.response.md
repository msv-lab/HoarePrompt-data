According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10, which means `n` must be of the form `9, 19, 29, ...` (i.e., `n % 10 == 9`).

At the end of the last iteration, `n` can be 0, 1, 2, or any integer value based on the integer division of `(n // 10)`, and `max_9s` is 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted so that it satisfies the condition. The only valid state for `n` to ensure that `n + 1` is a multiple of 10 is for `n` to be 9.

Thus, the adjustment needed is for `n` to be exactly 9.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 1**
