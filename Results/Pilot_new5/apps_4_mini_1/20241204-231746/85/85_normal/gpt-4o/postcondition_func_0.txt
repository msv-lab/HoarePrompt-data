The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), counts the number of consecutive 9s at the end of `n`, and calculates the product of the integer part of `n + 1` and the count of those 9s. It then prints this product. The function does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range, nor does it validate the input type, potentially leading to runtime errors.
