Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of shovel pairs that yield a sum ending with the maximum number of nines. 

Specifically, the logic used in the `if` statement:
```python
if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
```
is not correct for checking if the sum of two shovels ends with nines. It is attempting to check if the resulting sum is a multiple of a power of ten, but this does not accurately identify sums that end with multiple nines (e.g., 9, 99, 999, etc.).

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. The correct pairs yielding a sum that ends with one nine are:
- (2, 7) -> 9
- (3, 6) -> 9
- (4, 5) -> 9

The expected output should be `3`. However, the current implementation may not correctly count these pairs based on the flawed condition in the `if` statement.

Another potential case is for `n = 50`. The correct pair is (49, 50) resulting in `99`, which ends with two nines, but the program does not seem to account for this correctly.

Thus, the logic fails for various values of `n`, confirming that the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
