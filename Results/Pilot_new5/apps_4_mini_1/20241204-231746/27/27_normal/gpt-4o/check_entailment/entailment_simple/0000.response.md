Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The `input` function is redefined within the `func_1` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, the original `input` function (which reads input from standard input) is overridden, and `sys` is not imported in the program, leading to a potential NameError when the function tries to read input.

2. **Expression Calculation**: The mathematical expressions calculated in the tuples of `expressions` need to be evaluated correctly. However, the program does not handle cases where floating-point precision might affect the maximum computation. The way powers are evaluated in Python can lead to different results due to the order of operations, especially with floating-point arithmetic.

3. **Output Format**: The output formatting should ensure that the expressions are printed as specified in the problem description. The program correctly formats expressions in the tuples, but if the maximum value has multiple occurrences, it does not ensure that the first occurrence is selected. It uses the `max` function, which will only return the first maximum encountered.

4. **Dependency on External Libraries**: The program does not import the necessary libraries (like `sys`) that are used in the function, which will cause the program to fail when executed.

In summary, due to the improper handling of input, potential issues with floating-point computations, and the lack of an import statement for `sys`, the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements effectively.
