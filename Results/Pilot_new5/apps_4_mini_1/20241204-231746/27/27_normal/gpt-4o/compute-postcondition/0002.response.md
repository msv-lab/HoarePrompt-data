The code creates a list of tuples, each containing a mathematical expression involving the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with a corresponding string label for that expression. The precondition regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains unchanged, while the variable `expressions` is assigned the list of computed expressions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `expressions` is a list of tuples containing expressions and their labels.**
