Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem requirements. It takes three positive real numbers x, y, and z, computes the twelve different exponentiation expressions as specified, and finds the maximum among them. It also correctly determines the smallest index of the maximum value in the list of expressions and prints the corresponding expression in the required format.

The calculations and comparisons are correctly handled using Python's floating-point arithmetic, and the use of lists allows for efficient indexing and retrieval of the corresponding expression. Since the output format requirements are also strictly followed, the program meets the problem's expectations for all valid input cases. 

No edge cases or inputs seem to expose any flaws in the logic of the program, confirming its correctness.
