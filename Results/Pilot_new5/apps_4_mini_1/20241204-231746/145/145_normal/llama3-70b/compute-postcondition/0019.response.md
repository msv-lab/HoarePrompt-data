The value of `curr_sum` is incremented by the value of `digit`. Since `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is half of that non-negative even integer, and other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `curr_sum` is `curr_sum + digit`. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `curr_sum`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n, `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is updated to `curr_sum + digit`, `segments` remains unchanged, `digit` is the next digit in the ticket.**
