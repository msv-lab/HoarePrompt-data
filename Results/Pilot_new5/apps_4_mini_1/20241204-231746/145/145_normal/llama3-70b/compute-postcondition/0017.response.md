Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is increased by 1 while remaining unchanged; otherwise, `segments` remains unchanged.***
