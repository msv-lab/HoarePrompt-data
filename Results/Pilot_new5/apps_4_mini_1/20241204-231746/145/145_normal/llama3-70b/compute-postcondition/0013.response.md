According to the code, the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `ticket`. Since `ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute for each digit in the string. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `digit` is the first character of the `ticket`, it means the loop has executed for the first character. For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` should be updated to the second character of the string. This means that the loop has processed one digit already, and we need to check the conditions for the second character.

The length of the string `ticket` is `n`, and since there are 2 or more digits, for the loop to execute again we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments at the start of the next iteration are:
- `digit` will be the second character of the `ticket` string.
- The value of `segments` will remain the same as it only increases when `curr_sum` is updated, and there is no information on whether `curr_sum` needs to be checked again.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` can be either 0 or a value less than or equal to `target_sum`, `segments` remains unchanged, `digit` is the second character of the ticket string**.
