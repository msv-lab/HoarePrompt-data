`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), where each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is 0.
