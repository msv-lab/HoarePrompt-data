Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`. If `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is updated to 0, `segments` is increased to 1, and `digit` is the first character of the ticket string.***
