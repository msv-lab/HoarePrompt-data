The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive. After executing the function body, if the total sum of the digits is odd, the function returns `False`. If the total sum is even, it then checks the number of segments where the cumulative sum reached a target sum, returning a boolean indicating whether this count is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `ticket`, and return `False` if the total sum of the digits is odd, or a boolean indicating if the count of segments reaching the target sum is at least 2 if the total sum is even. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ticket, returns False if the total sum of the digits is odd, or a boolean indicating if the number of segments reaching the target sum is greater than or equal to 2 if the total sum is even.**
