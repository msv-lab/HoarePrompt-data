The function accepts a string `ticket`, which contains digits whose sum is calculated. If the sum is odd, it returns False. If the sum is even, the function checks how many times the cumulative sum of digits reaches half of the total sum. It returns True if this occurs at least twice, otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that the digits in `ticket` are processed as integers, so it will need a conversion from characters to integers for the sum to be accurate.
