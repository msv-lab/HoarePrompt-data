`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 0, so its new value will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 0.
