Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is between 1 and `n-1`, `target_sum` is equal to the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of all processed digits in `ticket`, `segment_count` is the number of segments found that match `target_sum`. After all iterations, `current_sum` is equal to 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1 if the function returns 'YES', otherwise `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
