The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters: `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are integers that define the range of indices to be summed in the string `ticket`. The string `ticket` is a sequence of digits, and its length is constrained between 2 and 100. The function returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in `ticket` between the specified indices `start` and `end`, inclusive. Therefore, the functionality of the function `segment_sum` is to accept two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and return the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from the index `start` to the index `end`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, start and end, and returns the sum of the digits in the string ticket from index start to index end, inclusive.**
