Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a string `ticket` of `n` digits. It checks if it is possible to split the digits into multiple segments such that each segment has the same sum, returning 'YES' if such a split is possible and `segment_count` is greater than 1; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. If no valid splitting exists, it will also return 'NO' if either the total processed sum is not zero or if only one valid segment is found. **
