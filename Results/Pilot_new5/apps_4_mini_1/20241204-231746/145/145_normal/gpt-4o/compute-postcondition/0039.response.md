According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, which means that `i` is less than `n`. 

In the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which will now be 2. 

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are as follows:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is 2. `n` must be greater than 2.**
