The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`. However, since `current_sum` is reset to `0`, the prior calculation involving `int(ticket[2])` is disregarded. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `i` is 2**
