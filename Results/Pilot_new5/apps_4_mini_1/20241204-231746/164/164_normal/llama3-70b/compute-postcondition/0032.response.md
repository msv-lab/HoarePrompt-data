Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T', with the remaining characters either as '.' or '#'. It checks if 'G' can reach 'T' by moving `k` steps at a time without encountering any '#' characters. If 'G' or 'T' is not found, it outputs 'NO'. If the absolute difference between the indices of 'T' and 'G' is divisible by `k` and there are no '#' characters in the way, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
