Postcondition: ***`g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`. If either 'G' or 'T' do not appear in `s`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and there are no '#' characters in the positions defined by `g + i * k` (modulo `n`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `(abs(t - g) // k)`, the output is 'YES'. If these conditions are not met, the output is 'NO'.***
