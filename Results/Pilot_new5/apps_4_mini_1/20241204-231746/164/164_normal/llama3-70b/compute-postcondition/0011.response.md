According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1.**
