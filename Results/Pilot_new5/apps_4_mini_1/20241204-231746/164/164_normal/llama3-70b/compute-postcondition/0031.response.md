The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it works with the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and there is an input string of length `n` that contains exactly one 'G' and one 'T', with the remainder of the string being either '.' or '#'. 

The function's output behavior is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that it processes the input string based on the given constraints.

Since there are no return points described in the output, we cannot specify any conditions for the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is primarily centered around handling the input based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an input string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T', with the rest being either '.' or '#', while k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.**
