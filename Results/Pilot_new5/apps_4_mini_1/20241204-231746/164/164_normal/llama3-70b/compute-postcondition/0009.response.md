Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and `s` is an input string. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0 while `g` remains -1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `g` is still -1, `t` is still -1, and `i` is still 0.***
