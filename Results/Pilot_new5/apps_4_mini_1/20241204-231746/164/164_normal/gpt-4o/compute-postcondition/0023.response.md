The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop given the `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State maintains the prior values but indicates that we exit the most internal loop. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is the next value after increment, which is `G_pos + k`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
