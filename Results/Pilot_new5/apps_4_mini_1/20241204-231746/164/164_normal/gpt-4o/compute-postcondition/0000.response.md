`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where the input is expected to consist of two integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `k` must still satisfy the conditions stated in the initial state (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and both `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.**
