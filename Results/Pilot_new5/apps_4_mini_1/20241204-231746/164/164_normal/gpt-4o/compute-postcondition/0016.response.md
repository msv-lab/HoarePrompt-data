According to the code, the loop will iterate from `G_pos` to `T_pos`, and it increases `pos` by `k` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `pos` is equal to both `G_pos` and `T_pos`, which means the loop has already reached `T_pos`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the conditions. Since `G_pos` is defined as the starting position and `T_pos` is the end position, if the loop is to execute again, `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. However, since `pos` is currently equal to `T_pos`, the next value of `pos` would be `T_pos + k`, which would exceed `T_pos`, causing the loop to terminate.

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `T_pos` must be increased to ensure the condition `pos ≤ T_pos` holds true after the next increment of `pos`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, `reachable` is True if `pos` is equal to `T_pos + k`, and `pos` is set to both `G_pos` and `T_pos + k`.**
