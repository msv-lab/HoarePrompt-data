Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True if `pos` equals `T_pos` after the last iteration, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos` if the loop completes without encountering '#', otherwise `pos` will be the first index in `line` that contains '#' after `G_pos`. If the loop does not execute, `pos` remains equal to `G_pos`, and `reachable` remains False.**
