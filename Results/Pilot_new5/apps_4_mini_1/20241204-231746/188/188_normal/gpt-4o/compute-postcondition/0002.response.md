The `count` variable is assigned the value of `Counter(cards)`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `cards`. The initial state of `n` and `cards` remains valid, but now we have a new variable `count` that holds a dictionary-like object with counts of each integer in `cards`. The states of `n` and `cards` are not altered, just the introduction of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `count` is a Counter object containing counts of each integer in `cards`.**
