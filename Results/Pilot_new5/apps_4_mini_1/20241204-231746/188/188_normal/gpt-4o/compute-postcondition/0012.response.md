Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `count` is a Counter object containing counts of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys of `count`, sorted by their counts in ascending order. If `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` are both equal to `n // 2`, the output 'YES' is printed along with the values `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
