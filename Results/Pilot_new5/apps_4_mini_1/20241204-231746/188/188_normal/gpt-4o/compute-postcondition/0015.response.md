Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100). It checks if there are at least two unique numbers in the list. If there are, it then checks if the two most frequent unique numbers both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' along with these two numbers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it also prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., if `n` is not even or not within the specified range).**
