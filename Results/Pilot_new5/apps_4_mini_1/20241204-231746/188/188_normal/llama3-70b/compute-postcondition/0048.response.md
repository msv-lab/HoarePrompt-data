The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or whichever structure we were inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; `c` is unchanged; `a1` is unchanged; `a2` is equal to `i`; and we break out of the most internal loop or structure we were inside.
