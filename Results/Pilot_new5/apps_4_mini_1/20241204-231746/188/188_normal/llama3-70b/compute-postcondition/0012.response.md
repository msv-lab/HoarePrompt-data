The variable `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is currently taking a value from the list `a`. The value of `i` corresponds to some index in the list `d`. Since `n` is an even integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \) and `a` contains `n` input integers, the value of `i` is guaranteed to be a valid index for `d`.

After the execution of the code, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged, but the value at index `i` in the list `d` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `i` is currently taking values from `a` during iteration; `d[i]` is increased by 1.**
