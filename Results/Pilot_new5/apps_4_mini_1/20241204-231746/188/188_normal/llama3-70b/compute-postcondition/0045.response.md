The value of `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the states of all other variables are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; `c` is unchanged; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; `c` is unchanged; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is the new value of `i`.**
