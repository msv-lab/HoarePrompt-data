The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list containing `n` integers, the specific values of `i`, `c`, `a1`, and `d` are not altered by this assignment either. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a2` now holds the value of `i`, while the precondition remains intact.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is `i`, `c` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `a1` is the appropriate value based on `c`, `a2` is equal to `i`.**
