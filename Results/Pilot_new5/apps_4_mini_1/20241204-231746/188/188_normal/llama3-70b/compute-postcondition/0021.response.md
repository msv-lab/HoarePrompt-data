The variable `i` takes the value of the next integer in the list `a`. The operation `d[i] += 1` increments the count in `d` at the index `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n + 1` input integers, and `d` contains updated counts. The exact value of `i` depends on the next integer present in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n + 1` input integers; `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the next integer in the list `a`.**
