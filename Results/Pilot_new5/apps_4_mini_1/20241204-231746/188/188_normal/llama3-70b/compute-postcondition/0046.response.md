The value of `c` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `c` is unknown, but it will now be `previous value of c + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `a1`, `a2`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; `c` is increased by 1; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is the new value of `i`.**
