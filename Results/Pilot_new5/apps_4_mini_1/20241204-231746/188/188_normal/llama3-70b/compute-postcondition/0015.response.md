Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, and `i` is currently taking values from `a` during iteration. If `i` is in `d`, then `d[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `d` now contains the entry `i: 1`, where `i` is a value from `a`.***
