The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that must have at least 1 key; `c` is not equal to 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is equal to `i`; `i` is the first key in `d`; the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
