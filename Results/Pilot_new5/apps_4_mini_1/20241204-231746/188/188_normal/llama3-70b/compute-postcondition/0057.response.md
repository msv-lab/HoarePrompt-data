Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` with at least two keys having values equal to `n // 2`. If both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, then `c` is 2, the output is 'YES', and the values printed are `a1` and `a2`. If either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1 (or both), the output is 'NO'. In this case, `c` is either 1 if only one key had `d[i]` equal to `n // 2` or 0 if no keys matched, leaving `a1` and `a2` as -1.***
