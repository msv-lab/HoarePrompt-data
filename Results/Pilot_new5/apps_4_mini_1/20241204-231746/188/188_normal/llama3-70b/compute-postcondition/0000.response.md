The value of `n` is reassigned with the value obtained from `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold an integer input value. However, the initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. After inputting, `n` will still conform to these constraints, but now it will hold the value of the integer input provided. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (updated to the input integer value)**
