The variable `a` is assigned an empty list. The variable `n` remains an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is an empty list**.
