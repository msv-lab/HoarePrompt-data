The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of itself plus `max_speed`. Since `max_length` is initially equal to `max_speed * (t + 1)`, after the execution of the code, it will now be equal to the original `max_length` plus `max_speed`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
