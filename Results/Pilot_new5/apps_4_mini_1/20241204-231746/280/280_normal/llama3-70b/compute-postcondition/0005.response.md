`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. The values of `min_speed` and `t` are used for this calculation. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `max_length` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.**
