The code modifies the `max_length` variable by adding `max_speed` to its current value. The previous value of `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`. After the execution, the new value of `max_length` becomes `max_speed * t + max_speed`, which can be factored to `max_speed * (t + 1)`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`, and `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
