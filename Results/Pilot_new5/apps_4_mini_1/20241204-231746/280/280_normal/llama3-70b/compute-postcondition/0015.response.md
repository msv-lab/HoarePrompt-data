The variable `min_length` is incremented by the value of `min_speed`. The previous values of the variables remain valid, so we assume `min_length` was equal to its previous value before the operation. The specific values of `min_speed` and `min_length` are not known, but we know that `min_length` increases by `min_speed`. Therefore, the output maintains the integrity of the other variables while updating `min_length`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed, `i` is `t - 2`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `min_length` is updated to its previous value plus `min_speed`.**
