Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `min_length` is updated to its previous value plus `min_speed`.**
