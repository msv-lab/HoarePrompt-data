The function accepts two integers, `v1` and `v2`, representing initial speeds in meters per second, and two integers, `t` (time in seconds) and `d` (maximum speed change per second). It calculates the maximum and minimum distance that can be traveled over the given time period while adjusting the speeds based on the allowed changes (`d`). The maximum speed can decrease by `d` each second, while the minimum speed can increase by `d` each second, but they are constrained by each other. The function then sums the maximum and minimum lengths that can be achieved after `t` seconds, and prints the final maximum length. 

However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the maximum length, which is a notable omission in the annotations. Additionally, the function assumes that valid inputs will be provided and does not handle potential edge cases related to invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges.

Functionality: ** The function takes initial speeds `v1` and `v2`, time `t`, and maximum speed change `d`, calculates the maximum distance that can be traveled over `t` seconds given the speed constraints, and prints the maximum distance without returning it. **
