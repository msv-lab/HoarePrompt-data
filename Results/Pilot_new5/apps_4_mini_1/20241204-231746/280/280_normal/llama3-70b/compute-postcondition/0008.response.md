The value of `min_speed` is updated by taking the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. The previous value of `min_speed` is not known, but it is defined as the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`. The `max_speed` remains unchanged after this operation, as it is not directly affected. The values of `t`, `d`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` also remain unchanged. However, `min_speed` will now be calculated to reflect the addition of `d`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`, and `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`, and `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
