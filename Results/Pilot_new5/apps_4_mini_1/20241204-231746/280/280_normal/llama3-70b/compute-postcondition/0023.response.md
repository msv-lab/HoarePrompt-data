The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, we can infer that it likely utilizes four variables: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. Here are the details for each:

- `v_1` and `v_2` are integers representing speeds in meters per second, constrained such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100.
- `t` is an integer representing time in seconds, constrained such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `d` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum speed change per second, constrained such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.

Based on the output description which is not provided here, we must infer what the function returns based on the relationships between these parameters.

Since the output is not explicitly stated, we cannot detail the return values or conditions without that information. Therefore, a complete description cannot be provided accurately.

Thus, the functionality of the function is dependent on the relationships and rules that govern the outputs based on the input parameters, which are currently unspecified.

Functionality: **The function utilizes parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, and presumably returns a result based on the relationships between these parameters, though the exact output conditions are not provided.**
