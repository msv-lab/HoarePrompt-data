The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers. The states of the other variables (`t` and `d`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` and `v_2` are now integers based on the input, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), while `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive).

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive).**
