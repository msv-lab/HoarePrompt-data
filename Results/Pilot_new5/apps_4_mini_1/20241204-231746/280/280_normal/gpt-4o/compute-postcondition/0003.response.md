The code assigns the value of `v_1` to the first element of the list `speeds`. The previous values of `speeds` were all zeros, and now the first element (index 0) will be set to the value of `v_1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer based on the input; `v_2` is an integer based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive); `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` equals `v_1` and the rest of the elements remain the same.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer based on the input; `v_2` is an integer based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive); `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` equals `v_1` and `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` are still zeros.**
