The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The parameter `v_1` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is also an integer within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). 

Since there is no output information provided, we can't determine the specific return values based on the inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integer parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, with specified constraints on their values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, with v_1 and v_2 being integers in the range 1 to 100, t being an integer in the range 2 to 100, and d being an integer in the range 0 to 10.**
