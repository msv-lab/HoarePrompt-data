To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, let's break it down:

- The initial state provides that `speeds[1]` has been updated and that `i` is `3`. We also know that `t` must be greater than `3`.
- The code `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` indicates that `speeds[3]` will be assigned a value based on the minimum of two expressions.

Now let's consider the variable values:
- `i` is `3`, so `i - 1` equals `2`.
- `speeds[2]` will be computed as `speeds[2] = min(speeds[2] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.

All other variables in the initial state remain unchanged or unaffected by the execution of this line of code.

Therefore, the output state captures the relationship and changes:

Output State: **`speeds[1]` is updated, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 3, `speeds[3]` is assigned the value of min(speeds[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)**
