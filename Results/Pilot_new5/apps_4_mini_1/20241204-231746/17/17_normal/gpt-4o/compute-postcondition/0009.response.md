The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on four non-negative integers: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, with the constraints that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}. However, since the function does not take these values as input parameters, it is unclear from the provided information how these integers are used or returned. Therefore, without further details about the output based on the operations involving these integers, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
