The statement `print(1)` outputs the integer `1`. This operation does not change the values of any of the variables. Thus, the output state includes all the previous information as it remains valid, and we simply indicate that `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer, and 1 has been printed.**
