The code takes input for four variables, `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`, by reading four lines of input and converting them to integers. This overwrites the previous values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. The initial conditions state that these variables are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 10^9.

Since the exact input values are not provided, we will denote them in terms of their input, letting `input1`, `input2`, `input3`, and `input4` represent the values entered by the user.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_3` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer, where `cnt1` is `input1`, `cnt2` is `input2`, `cnt3` is `input3`, and `cnt4` is `input4`**
