The `print(1)` statement outputs the integer `1` to the console. The values of the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, all preconditions regarding these variables are still valid after execution.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers, and `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`, and 1 is printed to the console.**
