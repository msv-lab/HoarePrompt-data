The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with a combined length not exceeding 100,000. After executing the function body, it computes the weighted sum of the characters in the concatenated strings of tuple `s` using a specific formula involving the golden ratio. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters, and return the weighted sum based on the defined mathematical expression. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the weighted sum of the characters in the concatenated strings.**
