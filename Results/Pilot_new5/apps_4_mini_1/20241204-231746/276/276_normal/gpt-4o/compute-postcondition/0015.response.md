The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and its length does not exceed 100,000. The function returns the sum of `q` raised to the power of (n - i - 1) for each index `i` where `s[i]` is '1'. If there are no '1's in `s`, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` and return the calculated sum based on the indices of '1's in the string, or 0 if there are no '1's. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string s consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of q raised to the power of (n - i - 1) for each index i where s[i] is '1', or 0 if there are no '1's in s.**
