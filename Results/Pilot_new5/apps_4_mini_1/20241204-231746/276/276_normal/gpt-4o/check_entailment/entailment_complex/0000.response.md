Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description regarding the comparison of two numbers expressed in the "golden system." Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings, `s1` and `s2`, which consist of '0's and '1's. This aligns with the problem's requirement that the input must consist of such strings.

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1(s)` computes the decimal value of the string `s` in the golden system, where `q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. It iterates through each character in the string, and for each '1' found, it adds `q` raised to the appropriate power to the total value. This accurately represents the mathematical expression defined in the problem description, where the decimal value of the number is calculated as:
   \[
   \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}
   \]
   Here, `a_i` corresponds to the digits in `s`.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the values for both strings using `func_1`, the program compares these values. It prints '>' if the first value is greater, '<' if it is smaller, and '=' if they are equal. This is exactly what the problem requires regarding output.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as strings that only contain '0's or '1's. The function returns 0 if there are no '1's, ensuring that the comparison logic behaves as expected (for instance, '000' would be compared to '1' accurately).

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the specified functionality to compare two numbers in the "golden system." Thus, it is correct in all potential cases outlined by the problem.
