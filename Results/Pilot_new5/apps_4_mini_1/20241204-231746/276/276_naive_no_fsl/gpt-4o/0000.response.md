Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in the logic used to compute the decimal value of the numbers represented in the golden system notation. 

Here's the issue: The current implementation only sums the values of `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1` for each '1' in the string. However, the golden system requires that the position of the digits (both '0' and '1') affects the overall value, even when '0' is present. Specifically, the value of '0' at any position should also contribute to the power of `q` being raised, it just contributes 0 to the sum.

For example, consider the input case:
```
s1 = "101"
s2 = "10"
```

For `s1`, this represents:
- '1' at position 0 contributes `q^2`
- '0' at position 1 contributes `0`
- '1' at position 2 contributes `q^0`
So `value1 = q^2 + q^0`.

For `s2`, this represents:
- '1' at position 0 contributes `q^1`
- '0' at position 1 contributes `0`
So `value2 = q^1`.

Calculating both values using the current program will result in incorrect comparisons because the function does not accurately account for the powers of `q` that correspond to both '0' and '1' in the string. The power of `q` should always account for the total length of the string to represent the correct decimal equivalent.

Therefore, the program fails to handle the correct logic for comparing two numbers in the golden system, leading to potential inaccuracies in output for certain inputs. Thus, the program is deemed incorrect.
