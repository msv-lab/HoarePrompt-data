To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it handles various cases based on the requirements.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `A` of integers from input.

2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the array `A`.

3. **Case Where Total Sum is Not Zero**: 
   - If `total_sum != 0`, the program prints "YES", followed by "1", and the indices `1` and `n`, which represents the whole array as a single subarray. This aligns with the requirement since a single non-zero total is valid.

4. **Case Where Total Sum is Zero**:
   - If `total_sum == 0`, the program enters a loop to check for non-zero elements.
   - If it finds a non-zero element `A[i]`, it prints "YES", followed by "2", and outputs two subarrays: the first from the start of the array to the index of the first non-zero element, and the second from the next element to the end. This correctly creates two arrays where at least one of them has a non-zero sum.
   - If all elements are zero (which would mean `total_sum` is zero and the loop does not find any non-zero elements), it will not output "NO". The code does not handle this case explicitly, which is a problem.

### Missing Case
The program fails to print "NO" when all elements of the array are zero. According to the problem description, if it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, the output must be "NO".

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where all elements are zero correctly. Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
