Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers each satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, and `total_sum` is the sum of elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, '1' is printed along with the value of `n`. If `total_sum` is 0 and there is at least one non-zero element in `A`, 'YES' is printed along with '2', followed by two indices indicating the position of that non-zero element and the end of the list; otherwise, 'NO' is printed if all elements are zero.***
