The code prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `i + 2` is 4. The value of `n` is at least 2 but unspecified beyond that. The output of the `print` statement does not affect any of the variables, so the state of all other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, and '1 3' has been printed. Output of print is 4 and n.**
