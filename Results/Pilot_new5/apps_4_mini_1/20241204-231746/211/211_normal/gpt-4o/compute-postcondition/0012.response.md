The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints the string '1' followed by the result of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The output will be '1 1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, and 'YES' is printed to the output. Output is '1 1'.**
