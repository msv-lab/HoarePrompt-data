The code prints the result of `i + 2` and `n`. The initial value of `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `i + 2` equals `3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, 'YES' is printed, and the output printed is '3 n' where n is at least 2.**
