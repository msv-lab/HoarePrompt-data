Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it incorrectly processes cases where the total sum of the array is zero. The requirements state that the program should split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is not zero. However, the program only checks if the total sum is zero at the start and returns "NO" if it is, which does not account for the possibility of splitting the array in a way that results in non-zero subarrays.

Additionally, the logic for determining the indices of the subarrays is flawed. The program only increments `k` and updates `l` when a non-zero prefix sum that is not equal to the total sum is found. This means it might miss valid splits, especially when the prefix sums can be non-zero while still allowing for valid subarrays that could sum to zero when combined.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, -3]`. The total sum is zero, but it is possible to split it into subarrays like `[1, 2]` and `[-3]`, both of which are valid as they do not sum to zero when isolated.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of producing valid outputs in all cases, thus making it incorrect.
