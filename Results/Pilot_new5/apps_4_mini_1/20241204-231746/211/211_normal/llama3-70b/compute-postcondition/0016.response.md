According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `r`. The loop runs from `1` to `n`, inclusive. Given that `n` is a positive integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, we can confirm that `r` will take values from `1` up to `n`. 

At the start of the loop, `r` should be initialized to `1` for the first iteration. The value of `n` must also be in the defined range, which it is according to the provided state.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that:
- `n` is a positive integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (which is already given).
- `r` starts at `1` for the first iteration.

Thus, no further adjustments are needed beyond what is already provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1**
