The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `r`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `n`, `r`, and `prefix_sum` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `k` is increased by 1.**
