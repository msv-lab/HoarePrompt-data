According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the index `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1**
