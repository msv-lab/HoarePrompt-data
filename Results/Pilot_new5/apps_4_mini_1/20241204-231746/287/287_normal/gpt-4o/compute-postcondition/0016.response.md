To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= num`. 

1. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1). This can be expressed as:
   - `num >= i * i + 2 * i + 1`
   
2. The loop condition is `i * i <= num`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must be true that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `num`.

3. We know the current value of `i` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, so the next value of `i` is `i + 1`.

4. Substituting `i + 1` into the loop condition, we have:
   - `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= num`, which simplifies to:
   - `i * i + 2 * i + 1 <= num`

5. Since we already know that `num` is greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1`, this means the loop can execute one more time as long as `num` remains at least equal to this value.

Therefore, no changes need to be made to the values of `num`, `count`, or `i` since the condition for the loop to execute is satisfied as per the current state.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 4 or greater than 4, and `i` is incremented by 1**
