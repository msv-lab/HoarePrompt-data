The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `num` is greater than or equal to 4 and divisible by `i` (which is 1), the `count` will become 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 1, `i` is 1. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 1, `i` is 1**
