Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. 

The problem requires calculating the number of different weights of splits of a number `n`. However, the provided program, `func_1`, instead counts the number of divisors of `n`. This is a completely different task. The splits of a number involve generating non-increasing sequences of integers that sum to `n`, and determining the weights based on the occurrences of the first element in those sequences, which is not addressed at all in the program.

In particular, the output of the program will not correspond to the output needed for the example cases, as it will simply return the count of divisors rather than the weight of splits. For instance:
- For `n = 7`, the function will return `4`, which is the number of divisors `1, 7` (and others if applicable) instead of the expected `4` different weights of splits.
- For `n = 8`, the function will compute the number of divisors rather than the different valid weights for splits.

Thus, since the program does not perform the calculations described in the problem, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
