The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Given that `res` is modified and the initial conditions of `n` and `i` remain valid, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is such that `i * i` equals `n`; `res` is decremented by 1.**
