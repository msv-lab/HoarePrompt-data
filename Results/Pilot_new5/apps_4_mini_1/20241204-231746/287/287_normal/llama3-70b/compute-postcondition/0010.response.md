`res` is incremented by 2. The initial state of `n` remains the same as it is within the specified range, and `i` has already been incremented and must still be less than or equal to `int(n)`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `res` but maintain the other constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` has been potentially decremented or set and increased by 2, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than or equal to `int(n)`**
