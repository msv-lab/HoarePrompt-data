`res` is decremented by 1. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `res` is decreased by 1; `i` remains unchanged, and `res` maintains its prior conditions except for the decrement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `res` is decreased by 1; `i` is unchanged.**
