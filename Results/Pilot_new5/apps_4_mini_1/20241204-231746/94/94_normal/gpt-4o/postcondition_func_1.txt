The function accepts a string `start` of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. It generates all unique states that can be reached by sliding 'X' into adjacent positions, returning a set of all valid configurations derived from the initial state during the iterations. It does not validate the input beyond the initial assumptions that 'X' is in a valid position within the string and the string contains 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
