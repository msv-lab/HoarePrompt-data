Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `new_row` is between 0 and 2 (exclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 2 (exclusive), and if `new_state_str` ('AXCB') was not in `visited`, then `queue` contains 'AXCB', `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'AXCB', while `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 1, and `new_state` is a list ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']. If the condition is not met, the program state remains unchanged.***
