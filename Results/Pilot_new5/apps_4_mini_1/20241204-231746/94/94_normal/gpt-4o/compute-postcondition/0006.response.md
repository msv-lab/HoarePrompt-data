The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the row and column indices of the `empty_pos` variable by dividing it by 2. Given that `empty_pos` is 3, the `divmod` function will return a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder when 3 is divided by 2. 

Specifically:
- `empty_row` will be the quotient of `3 // 2`, which is `1`.
- `empty_col` will be the remainder of `3 % 2`, which is `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1.**
