Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB' during all iterations, including 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', and any other valid states reachable by moving the empty space ('X') based on the directions; `queue` contains all these new valid states that have not been visited yet; `current` remains as 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, and `empty_row`, `empty_col` represent the original empty space location that may have been used to generate new states.**
