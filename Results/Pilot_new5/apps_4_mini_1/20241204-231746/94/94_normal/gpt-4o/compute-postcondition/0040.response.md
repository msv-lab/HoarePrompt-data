According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX', meaning it has elements. Since `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed. 

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1**
