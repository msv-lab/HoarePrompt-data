The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The variable `new_state_str` is formed by joining characters in `new_state`, but since the specific value of `new_state` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_state_str`. However, we know that `new_state_str` is a string that will be added to the `visited` set. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', and the value of `new_state_str` has been added to `visited'; `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`.**
