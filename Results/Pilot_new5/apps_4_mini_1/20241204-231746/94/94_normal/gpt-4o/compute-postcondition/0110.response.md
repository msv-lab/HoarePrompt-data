The variable `new_state_str` is appended to the `queue`, which means that `new_state_str` is now part of the `queue`. The values of `start`, `visited`, `current`, and `empty_pos` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated `queue` but maintain the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements plus `new_state_str`; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
