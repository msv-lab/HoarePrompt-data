The variable `empty_pos` represents the index of 'X' in the `current` string, which is 'AXCB'. The index of 'X' in 'AXCB' is 1. The `divmod` function takes two arguments, where the first is the dividend and the second is the divisor. Here, `empty_pos` is divided by 2. 

1. `empty_pos` is 1.
2. `divmod(1, 2)` results in a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1. Therefore, `empty_row` will be assigned the value 0, and `empty_col` will be assigned the value 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, and `empty_col` is 1.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1.**
