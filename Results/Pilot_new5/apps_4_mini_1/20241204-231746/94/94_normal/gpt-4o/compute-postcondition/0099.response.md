The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `visited` set with the addition of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and the previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` remains the first element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_state_str` is the string obtained by joining the characters of `new_state`.**
