Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds, specifically, 0 is less than 2 for `new_row` and 1 is less than 2 for `new_col`.***
