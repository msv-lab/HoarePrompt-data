According to the code, the loop iterates over the `directions` variable, which is likely a list of tuples representing possible movements (dr, dc). The loop will execute again for each direction available in `directions`. At the end of the last iteration, `visited` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX', and `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'. Since 'ACXB' is not previously in `visited`, it has been added to `visited` and `queue`.

Assuming that the loop successfully iterates through `directions` without any changes to `visited`, `current`, or `empty_pos`, the next iteration would use the next direction in the `directions` list.

However, we need to ensure that all states are adjusted for the next iteration based on the current values. If `current` remains 'AXCB', the next direction will modify the `empty_pos`, and potentially `new_state_str` and `new_state`. 

Thus, we do not have knowledge of the contents of `directions` or how they modify the `current` state. Therefore, we will keep `current` as it is, but we need to prepare to handle the next direction.

State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], and `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'**
