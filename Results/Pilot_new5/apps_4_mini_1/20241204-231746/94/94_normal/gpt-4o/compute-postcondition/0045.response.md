The operation assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction deltas `dr` and `dc`. However, the specific values of `dr` and `dc` are not provided in the initial state, meaning the exact values of `new_row` and `new_col` cannot be calculated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
