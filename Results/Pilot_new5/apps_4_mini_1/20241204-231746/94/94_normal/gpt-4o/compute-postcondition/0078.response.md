The value of `current` is assigned the first element from `queue` and this element is removed from `queue`. The values of `start`, `visited`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated value of `current` and the modified state of `queue` after the operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row`, `empty_col` represent the original empty space location.**
