The code assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction offsets `dr` and `dc`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are known: `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1. The values for `dr` and `dc` are not specified in the initial state but are required for this calculation to determine the resulting values of `new_row` and `new_col`. 

Given that the values of `dr` and `dc` are not provided, the output state can only express that `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated as follows:

- `new_row` = `empty_row` + `dr` = 0 + `dr`
- `new_col` = `empty_col` + `dc` = 1 + `dc`

The other variables remain unchanged, thus the output state includes their previous values.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, `directions` must contain at least 1 element.**
