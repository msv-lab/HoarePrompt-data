The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which converts the string `current` ('AXCB') into a list of its characters. Therefore, `new_state` will be `['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` and `new_col` are not defined, `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'].**
