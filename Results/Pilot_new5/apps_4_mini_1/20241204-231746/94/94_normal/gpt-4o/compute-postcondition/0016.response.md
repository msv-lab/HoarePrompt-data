The `queue` variable is updated by appending `new_state_str`, which is 'AXCB'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` now contains 'AXCB'; `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'AXCB'; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1; `new_pos` is 1; `new_state` is a list ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']; `new_state_str` is 'AXCB' and `new_state_str` was not in `visited` prior to execution.
