The `new_state` variable is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which converts the `current` string into a list of characters. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'AXCB', `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it, `current` remains the first element of the `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0 + `dr`, `new_col` is 1 + `dc`, `new_pos` is (0 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc), and `new_state` is a list of characters from `current`.
