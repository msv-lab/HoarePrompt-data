The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` currently hold the values 1 and 1, respectively. The variables `dr` and `dc` represent the next values in the directions, which have not been specified. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `new_row` will be calculated as `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` will be calculated as `empty_col + dc`. Given that the specific values for `dr` and `dc` are unknown, we cannot specify exact numerical values for `new_row` and `new_col`.

The output state reflects the change in `new_row` and `new_col` based on the additions to `empty_row` and `empty_col` respectively, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_row` is `1 + dr`; `new_col` is `1 + dc`.**
