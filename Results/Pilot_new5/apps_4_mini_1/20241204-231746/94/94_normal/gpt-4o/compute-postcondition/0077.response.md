According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet. Since the loop can execute again if `queue` is not empty, and there is no information indicating that `queue` is empty at the end of the last iteration, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet, `current` remains as 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row`, `empty_col` represent the original empty space location**
