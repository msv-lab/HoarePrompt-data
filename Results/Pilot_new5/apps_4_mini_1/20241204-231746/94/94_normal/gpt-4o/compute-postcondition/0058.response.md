To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the code snippet provided in relation to the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state includes `empty_pos` which is given as 1. We do not have values for `empty_row` and `empty_col` in the initial state, but they are used in the calculation of `new_row` and `new_col`. We will denote them as `empty_row` and `empty_col` for now, as they are crucial for determining `new_pos`.
  
2. The calculations for `new_row` and `new_col` depend on two variables, `dr` and `dc`, which are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we will denote them as `dr` and `dc`.

3. The variable `new_pos` is calculated using the formula: 
   ```
   new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
   ```

Since we don't have specific values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, we will keep them as variables in the output state. However, after the execution of the code, the new variable `new_pos` is added to the state as:

```
new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)
```

Thus, the output state will include all the initial values while updating `new_pos` with the expression derived from the initial parameters.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'ACXB', `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
