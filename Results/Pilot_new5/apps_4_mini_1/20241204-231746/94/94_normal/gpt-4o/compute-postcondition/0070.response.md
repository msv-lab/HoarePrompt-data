To execute the given code snippet, we need to analyze the state of the variables based on the provided initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is 'AXCB'
   - `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB'
   - `current` is 'AXCB'
   - `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)` (we don't have specific values for `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`, so we'll refer to `new_pos` as it is)
   - `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']

2. **Code Execution**:
   The line of code:
   ```
   new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]
   ```
   indicates a swap between the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the list `new_state`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` will be exchanged. 
   - Since we don't have specific values for `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`, we can't determine the exact values of `new_state` after the swap. However, we can indicate the change qualitatively.

4. **Output State**:
   The output state will reflect that `new_state` has changed due to the swap, while all other variables retain their existing states since they are not modified by the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` has had a swap between positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`**
