The value of `new_row` is `0 + dr` and `new_col` is `1 + dc`. Therefore, the value of `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The previous values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the values of `dr` and `dc`, which are not specified, but `new_row` is equal to `dr` and `new_col` is `1 + dc`. 

Thus, `new_pos` can be represented as `(dr * 2 + (1 + dc))`, simplifying to `2 * dr + 1 + dc`. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is equal to `2 * dr + 1 + dc`.**
