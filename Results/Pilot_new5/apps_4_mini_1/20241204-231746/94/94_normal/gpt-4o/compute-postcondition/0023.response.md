`new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are assigned values from each other. `empty_pos` is 3, and `new_pos` is calculated as `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`. Since `dr_value` and `dc_value` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `new_pos`, but we know it will be an integer derived from this calculation.

`new_state` initially contains ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']. The value at `empty_pos` (index 3) is 'X'. After the swap, `new_state[3]` will take on the value of `new_state[new_pos]`, and `new_state[new_pos]` will take on 'X'.

The output state will reflect the updated `new_state`, but we cannot determine the specific changes without knowing the values of `dr_value` and `dc_value`. However, we can express the output state in terms of `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` contains 'AXCB'; `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; `new_state` is a list containing ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'] with `new_state[3]` becoming the value of `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` taking on 'X'.**
