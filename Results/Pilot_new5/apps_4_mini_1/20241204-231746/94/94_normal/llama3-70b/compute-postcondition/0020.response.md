The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists representing a 2 Ã— 2 grid, containing exactly one occurrence of each of the tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and one occurrence of the empty cell 'X'. After executing the function body, it returns `True` if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other after swapping two specified elements, indicating they contain the same elements in different orders. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, and check if they can be made identical by swapping two of their elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two 2D lists puzzle1 and puzzle2, and returns True if puzzle1 and puzzle2 are permutations of each other after swapping two elements.**
