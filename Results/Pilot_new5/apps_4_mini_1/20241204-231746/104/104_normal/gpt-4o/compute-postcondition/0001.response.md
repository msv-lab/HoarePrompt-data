`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The initial state defines `n` as an input positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100) and `a` as a list of `n` integers, which must maintain the constraints of being distinct and in increasing order, where each integer is between 1 and 1000. The new value of `a` will therefore be a list of `n` integers that still satisfy these constraints, determined by the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` <= 1000, with `a` now containing integers derived from the input.**
