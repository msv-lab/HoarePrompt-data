According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. In the previous state, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 100. The for loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3.

Since `j` can go up to `n + 1`, for the loop to run again, the value of `n` must be at least 3 (to accommodate `j` being equal to 3).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
