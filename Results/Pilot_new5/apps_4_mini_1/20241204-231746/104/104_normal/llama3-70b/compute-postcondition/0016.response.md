According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` starts from the value of the starting index, it must be adjusted accordingly. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `i` must be set such that `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n`, ensuring that `i + 1` is at least 1 and at most `n`. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure:
- `i` is at least 0 (to allow `i + 1` to be at least 1) 
- `j` must start at `i + 1` (which is the first execution of the loop) and can go up to `n + 1`.

To summarize:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `i` must be at least 0 and less than n, `j` is now `i + 1`**.
