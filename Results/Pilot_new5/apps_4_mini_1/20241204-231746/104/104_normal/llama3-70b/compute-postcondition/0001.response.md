The variable `a` is assigned a new list created from the input, which consists of integers converted from a space-separated string input. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but the contents of the list `a` will now be determined by the user input. Since `n` is constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` must contain `n` integers that meet the condition of being in increasing order and within the range specified, the new state of `a` will reflect whatever valid integers are input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000**
