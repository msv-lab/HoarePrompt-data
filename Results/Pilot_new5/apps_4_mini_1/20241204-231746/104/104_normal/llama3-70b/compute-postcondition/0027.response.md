According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, which means the loop has executed for the current value of `i`. 

To execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, to ensure that the loop can continue, `i` must be updated to `i + 1` and it should remain less than `n`. Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is now one greater than its previous value and that `n` must still be a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `max_erase` is the maximum number of erasable elements from all valid subarrays starting at index `i` that satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for `k` in the range from `i` to `n`.**
