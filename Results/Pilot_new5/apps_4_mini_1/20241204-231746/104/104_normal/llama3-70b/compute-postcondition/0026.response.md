Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `max_erase` is the maximum number of erasable elements from all valid subarrays starting at index `i` that satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for `k` in the range from `i` to `n`.**
