The code evaluates the maximum of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. The previous values of `j` and `i` are defined such that `j` is `i + 1`. Therefore, we can derive that `j - i` equals `1`, meaning `j - i - 1` equals `0`. Given that `max_erase` is compared with `0`, the output will reflect the maximum value between `max_erase` and `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `max_erase` is max(max_erase, 0)**.
