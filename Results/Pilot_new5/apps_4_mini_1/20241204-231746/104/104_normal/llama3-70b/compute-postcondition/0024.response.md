In this case, the variable `max_erase` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the conditions: `j` is `i + 3`, we can substitute `j` in the expression. Thus, we have:

```
j - i - 1 = (i + 3) - i - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.
```

This means, after executing the code, `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `2`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the conditions of `n`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and must be at least `i + 3`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `max_erase` is max(`max_erase`, 2)**.
