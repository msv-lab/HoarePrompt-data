Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true, then `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and at least 1.***
