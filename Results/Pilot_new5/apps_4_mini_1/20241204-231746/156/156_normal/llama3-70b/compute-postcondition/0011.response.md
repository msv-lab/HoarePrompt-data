The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its signature, but it operates under certain constraints regarding the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here are the details regarding the constraints:

- `n` is an integer, always even, and lies within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `m` is an integer that also lies within the range 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.

Based on the output, the function processes these parameters to derive a result. However, since specific output behavior has not been provided, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function operates on parameters n, m, and k, where n is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, m is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n·m. The function performs operations based on these parameters, but specific output behavior is not defined.**
