Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer and `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`, where `remaining_steps` is calculated as the remainder of (k - (n - 1)) divided by (m - 1).***
