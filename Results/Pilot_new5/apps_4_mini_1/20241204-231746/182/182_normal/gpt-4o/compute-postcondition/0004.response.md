The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. The function processes this angle and returns a result based on the value of `x`. Since there are no further output conditions provided, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `x` that represents a camera rotation angle within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees within the range of -10^18 to 10^18.**
