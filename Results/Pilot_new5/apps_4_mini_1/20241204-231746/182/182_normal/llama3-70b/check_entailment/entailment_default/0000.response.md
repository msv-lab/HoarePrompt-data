To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to correct the orientation of a camera based on a given rotation angle `x`. The angle can be positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise). The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

1. The code begins by normalizing the input `x` to a range of [0, 360) using `x % 360`.
2. If the normalized angle is `0`, it correctly prints `0`, meaning no turns are needed.
3. For other angles, the calculation `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is used to determine how many 90-degree clockwise turns are required:
   - The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` effectively calculates how many full 90-degree segments fit into the angle.
   - The modulo operation `% 4` ensures that the result wraps around, representing the four possible orientations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function:
- Accepts an integer input `x`.
- Normalizes `x` to the range of [0, 360).
- If `x` is 0, it prints 0.
- It calculates and prints the equivalent direction as an integer in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Positive angles**: For an angle like `60`, the calculation should give `1` turn, which matches the description.
2. **Negative angles**: For an angle like `-60`, the normalization gives `300`, and the calculation should result in `3` turns, matching the description.
3. **Exact multiples of 90**: Angles like `90`, `180`, and `270` should return `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively, which the code handles correctly as well.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly handles the problem as described in all potential cases based on the provided examples. The output hints align with the function's logic, confirming that it produces the expected results in all scenarios.

Thus, after careful consideration of the problem description, code logic, and output hints:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function behaves as required by the problem statement and correctly identifies the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns for all valid input cases, including edge cases.
