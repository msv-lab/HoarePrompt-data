The variable `x` is assigned the value of `x % 360`. Given that `x` is an integer that can range from -10^18 to 10^18, the result of `x % 360` will yield a value that lies within the range of -359 to 359 degrees. This operation effectively normalizes the angle to a standard range for rotation in a circle. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, and after the operation `x` becomes `x % 360`, which will be within the range of -359 to 359.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, after the operation `x` becomes `x % 360` within the range of -359 to 359.**
