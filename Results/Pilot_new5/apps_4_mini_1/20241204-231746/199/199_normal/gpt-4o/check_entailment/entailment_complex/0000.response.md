To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the implemented logic adheres to the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must count the distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
   - The parts can form a rectangle.
   - The parts cannot form a square.
   
   Specifically, to form a rectangle using four parts, we need two pairs of equal lengths, i.e., the parts must be of the form {a, a, b, b}. For the parts to not form a square, it is required that `a` should not equal `b`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. The function checks if `n < 6`, returning `0` if true, which is appropriate since the minimum length for four positive integer parts (two pairs of equal lengths) is `6` (like {1, 1, 2, 2}).
   
2. It then initializes `count` to `0` and iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. This is correct because:
   - When `n` is divided among 4 parts, the maximum length of each part must be less than or equal to `n / 4` to ensure all parts remain positive.

3. Inside the loop:
   - It sets `b = a`, which corresponds to the first pair of lengths.
   - It calculates the remainder `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)` which gives the total length left after accounting for the two lengths `2a`.
   - It checks if `rem` is positive and even, which is necessary to form another pair of lengths.

4. The condition `if a != rem // 2` ensures that we do not count cases where the second pair would be equal to the first pair (which would form a square).

5. Finally, it increments the `count` for each valid configuration of (a, b).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to:
- Ensure that stick lengths are split into valid pairs,
- Avoid configurations that result in squares.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 6`, the only valid configuration is {1, 1, 2, 2}, which is handled correctly.
- For `n = 20`, the configurations are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7}, and {4, 4, 6, 6}, all of which are counted correctly by the logic.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly counts the distinct ways to split the stick.

Correctness: **True**
