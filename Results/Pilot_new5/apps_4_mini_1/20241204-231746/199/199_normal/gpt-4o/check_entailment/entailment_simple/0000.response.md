To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
Pasha wants to split a stick of length `n` into four positive integer lengths such that:
1. These lengths can form a rectangle (i.e., two pairs of equal lengths).
2. They cannot form a square (i.e., all four lengths cannot be equal).

### Key Points:
- To form a rectangle with four parts, we can denote the lengths as: `a, a, b, b` where `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- The total length must satisfy: `2a + 2b = n`, which simplifies to `a + b = n / 2`.
- Since `a` and `b` must be positive integers, `n` must be even for this to hold true, meaning `n % 2 == 0`.
- To avoid forming a square, we need `a` to not equal `b`, which implies `a` cannot equal `n / 4` (since that would make `a = b`).

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and checks if `n < 6`. If true, it returns `0`, which is correct because we need at least `n = 6` to form two pairs of positive integers.
  
2. **Loop for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. The logic here is correct because we are trying to find pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.
   - The value `b` is set equal to `a`, and then we calculate the remainder `rem` which is `n - 2 * (a + b)`, ensuring it captures the remaining stick length after accounting for the two pairs.
   - We check if `rem` is positive and even, which is necessary for `b` to also be a positive integer (since `b = rem / 2`).
   - The final check ensures `a != rem // 2`, which guarantees that we do not form a square.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The counter `count` is incremented correctly when all conditions are satisfied, thus counting valid configurations.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the ways to split the stick as described in the problem statement. It accurately counts the valid configurations while ensuring that the conditions for forming a rectangle without forming a square are met.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
