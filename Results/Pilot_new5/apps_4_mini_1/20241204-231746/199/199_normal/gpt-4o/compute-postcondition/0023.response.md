Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 12); if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then `count` is increased to 3, while `a` remains 3, `b` remains 3, and `rem` equals `n - 12`. If `rem` is not greater than 0 or not even, no changes occur to `count`, `a`, `b`, or `rem`.***
