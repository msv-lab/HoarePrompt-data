The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 4`, the remainder `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)` is greater than 0 and even, and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If no valid pairs are found, it returns 0.
