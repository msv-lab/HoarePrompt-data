The line `ways += 1` increments the value of the variable `ways` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `ways` remains unchanged, it will now hold a new value, which is one greater than its previous value. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected by this operation.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their previous values, but `ways` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (a + 1)`; `b` is `a + 1`; `ways` is incremented by 1.**
