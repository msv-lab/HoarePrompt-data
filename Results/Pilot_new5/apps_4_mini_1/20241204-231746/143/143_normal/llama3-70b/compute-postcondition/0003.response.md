The statement `dp[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the first element of the list `dp`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Since `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, this assignment specifically modifies the state of the first element in that list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, with dp[0] = 0, and other elements still initialized to `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, with dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] to dp[L] initialized to float('inf').**
