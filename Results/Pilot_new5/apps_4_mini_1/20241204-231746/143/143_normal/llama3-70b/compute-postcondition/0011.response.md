`vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is initially 1, the calculation becomes `2 ** 1 - 1`, which equals `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.**
