`vol` is assigned the value of \(2^j - 1\). The value of `j` is equal to `n`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\). Therefore, the value of `vol` will be \(2^n - 1\). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `vol` is equal to `2**n - 1`.**
