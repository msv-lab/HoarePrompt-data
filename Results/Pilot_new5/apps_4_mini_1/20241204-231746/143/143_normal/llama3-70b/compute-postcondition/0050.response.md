The code snippet checks the value of `dp[L]` and prints it if it's not equal to `float('inf')`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The previous state indicates that `dp[L]` could potentially be `float('inf')` if no valid combinations were found to achieve the length `L`. The state of `n` and `L` remains unchanged, but the outcome of `dp[L]` determines the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `dp[L]` is either a minimum cost value or -1 if `dp[L]` was `float('inf')**.
