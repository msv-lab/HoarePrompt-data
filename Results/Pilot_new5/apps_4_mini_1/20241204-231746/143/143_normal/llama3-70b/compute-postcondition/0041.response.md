The variable `vol` is assigned the value of \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is 1, we calculate \(2^1 - 1\), which results in \(2 - 1 = 1\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[2]` is the minimum value calculated from all valid updates during the loop executions, `vol` is 1, `j` is 1.**
