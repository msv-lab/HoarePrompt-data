After executing the code snippet `n, L = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `n` and `L` will be updated based on user input. The previous conditions regarding `n` and `L` still hold true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9.**
