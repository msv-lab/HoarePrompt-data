In the given code snippet, `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` and `costs[j]`. The variables affected by this line of code are `dp[i]`, `dp[i - vol]`, and `costs[j]`. 

Given that `i` is 3, `vol` is 1, and `j` is 1, we can express this operation as follows:
- `dp[i]` becomes `min(dp[3], dp[2] + costs[1])`.

The value of `dp[2]` is the minimum value calculated from prior valid updates in the loop, and `costs[j]` is the cost associated with `costs[1]`. 

The output state will reflect these updates, noting that `dp[i]` has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[2]` is the minimum value calculated from all valid updates during the loop executions, `vol` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[3]` is updated to min(dp[3], dp[2] + costs[1])**.
