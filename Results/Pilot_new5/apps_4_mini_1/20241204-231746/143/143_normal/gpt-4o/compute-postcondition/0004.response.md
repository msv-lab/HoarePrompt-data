The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0. 

Since `i` is 0, `dp[0]` will be assigned the minimum of `dp[0]` and `c[0]`. 

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation, and `i` remains 0. However, we need to note that `dp[0]` has been updated.

Therefore, the output state is: 
`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `dp[0]` is now the minimum of its previous value and `c[0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `dp[0]` is now min(dp[0], c[0])**
