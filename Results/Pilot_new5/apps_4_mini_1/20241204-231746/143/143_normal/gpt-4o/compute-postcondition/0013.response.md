The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Here, since `i` is 2, we are looking at `dp[2]` and `dp[1]`. The state of `dp[2]` will depend on the current value of `dp[2]` and the doubled value of `dp[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2)**
