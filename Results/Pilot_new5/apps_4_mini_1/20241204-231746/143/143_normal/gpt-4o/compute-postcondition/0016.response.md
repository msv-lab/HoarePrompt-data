Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `dp[i-1] * 2` for all `i` in the range from 1 to 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is min(10, c[2]); ... ; `dp[n]` is the minimum of its original value and `dp[n-1] * 2`; `dp[i]` for i in range(n+1, 31) remains 10.**
