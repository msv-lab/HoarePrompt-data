The variable `max_cost` is assigned the value `10 ** 18`, which is a constant and does not depend on any previous values. The other variables `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `max_cost` is 10 ** 18.**
