The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum of `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this means we are specifically looking at `dp[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `n` must be at least 2, the condition holds true.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])`, `dp[2]` is updated to `min(dp[2], c[2])**
