Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (representing the number of costs), a positive integer `L` (a limit), and a list of integers `costs` (containing costs). It calculates and returns the minimum total cost based on the given costs and the limit `L`, where costs can be doubled in each step, and returns a default maximum value (10^18) if no valid cost is found. **
