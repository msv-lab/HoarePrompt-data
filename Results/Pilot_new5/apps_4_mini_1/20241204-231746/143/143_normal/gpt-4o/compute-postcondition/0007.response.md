According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` will be incremented to 2 after the current iteration). 

Thus, the state should reflect that `i` is updated to 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])`**
