The code `L -= 1 << i` shifts the integer `1` left by `i` (which is 30), resulting in `1 << 30` equal to `2^30`. Thus, `L` is decremented by `2^30`. 

The other variables remain unaffected. The initial constraints on `L` are still valid after the operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31), `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `current_cost + dp[30]`, `i` is 30, `L` is now equal to `L - 2^30` (where L was originally ≥ 2^30).**
