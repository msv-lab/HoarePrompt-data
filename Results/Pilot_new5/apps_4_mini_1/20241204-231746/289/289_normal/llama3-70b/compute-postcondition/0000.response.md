The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. As `n` is initially a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\), the new value of `n` will still be a positive integer provided by the user's input. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `n` is an input positive integer.**
