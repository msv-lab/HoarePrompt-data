The `current_lcm` variable is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, which means that the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b` is being calculated. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` being positive integers, `diff` being greater than or equal to 2, `k` being 2, and `candidate` being `diff // 2` remain valid. However, the variables `new_a` and `new_b` are specifically defined as the smallest multiples of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Therefore, the output state accounts for the unchanged conditions and specifies that `current_lcm` has been calculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
