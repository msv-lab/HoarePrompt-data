The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is equal to `diff // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
