Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `diff`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
