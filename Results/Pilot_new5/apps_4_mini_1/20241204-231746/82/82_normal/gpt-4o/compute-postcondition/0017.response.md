The variable `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`. Given that `k` remains 1, `candidate` is equal to `diff`. The variable `new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `candidate` is equal to `diff`, we can substitute that in the expression for `new_a`. 

So, `new_a` becomes `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`. The values of `b`, `current_lcm`, and `new_b` remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `candidate` is equal to `diff // 1`, which is `diff`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
