The variable `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `diff`. Since `a` and `b` are both positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer as well. Therefore, `new_a` is calculated as the largest multiple of `diff` that is less than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is calculated as the largest multiple of `diff` that is less than or equal to `b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, but we do not know the specific values returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
