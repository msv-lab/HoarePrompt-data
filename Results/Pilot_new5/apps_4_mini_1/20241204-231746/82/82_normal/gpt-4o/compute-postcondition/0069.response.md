To analyze the impact of the code, we need to understand what `func_2(new_a, new_b)` does. However, as the functionality of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. 

Since the variables `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the initial values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `candidate`, we can describe their relationships based on the initial state. 

1. `new_a` is calculated based on `a` and `diff`, specifically, it is a multiple of `candidate` (which is `diff // 3`).
2. `new_b` is defined as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
3. The output from `func_2(new_a, new_b)` assigns a new value to `current_lcm`.

Since we do not know the value of `current_lcm`, we will just state that it is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Thus, the Output State will include all previously defined variables, and we will specify that `current_lcm` is the result of that function call.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
