Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
