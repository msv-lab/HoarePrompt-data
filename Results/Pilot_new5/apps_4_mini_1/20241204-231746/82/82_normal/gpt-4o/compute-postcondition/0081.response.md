Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `candidate` is either 3 or `diff // 3`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is calculated as the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is updated to the minimum least common multiple found during the iterations. If no iterations occur, `min_lcm` will retain its initial minimum value and `min_k` remains undefined or unchanged.***
