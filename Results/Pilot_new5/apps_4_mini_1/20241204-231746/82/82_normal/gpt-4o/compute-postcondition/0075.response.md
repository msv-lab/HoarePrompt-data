Given the initial state and the code snippet provided:

Initial State: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

The code executed is:
```
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

Now, we analyze the impact of the code execution:
- `candidate` is defined as `diff // 3`.
- `new_b` is calculated as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` achieves this.

Assuming `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is derived from `diff`, we can derive that `new_b` will be a multiple of `candidate`, specifically the smallest multiple that is equal to or greater than `b`.

Since the values of `a`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `current_lcm` are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`.**
