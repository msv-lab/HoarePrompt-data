To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **GCD Function (func_1)**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct as it directly implements a well-known algorithm for finding the GCD.

2. **LCM Function (func_2)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) based on the formula \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \). This is also correct and adheres to mathematical principles.

3. **Main Logic (func_3)**:
   - The function starts by checking if \( a \) is equal to \( b \). If they are equal, it returns \( 0 \) since \( \text{lcm}(a, b) \) is already minimized at that point.
   - It then calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \) and initializes variables to keep track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \).
   - The program iterates through all divisors of \( \text{diff} \) (up to the square root of \( \text{diff} \)) and tries each divisor \( k \) as a candidate for \( k \) in the calculations:
     - For each divisor, it computes the new values \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) such that both \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) are multiples of \( k \).
     - It calculates the LCM of these adjusted values and checks if it's smaller than the previously stored minimum LCM. If so, it updates both the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \).

### Conclusion:

- The logic correctly identifies that the LCM can be minimized by adjusting \( k \) appropriately. The iteration over all divisors of the difference guarantees that it checks all potential candidates for minimizing the LCM.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints given (values up to \( 10^9 \)), as it only checks divisors up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \).

### Testing Against Examples:

1. **Example Input: 6 10**
   - The minimum \( k \) is correctly found to be \( 2 \) as \( \text{lcm}(8, 12) = 24 \), which is the smallest LCM.

2. **Example Input: 21 31**
   - The program calculates and finds the correct \( k = 9 \) for minimizing the LCM.

3. **Example Input: 5 10**
   - It correctly returns \( k = 0 \) since \( \text{lcm}(5, 10) = 10 \) is already minimized.

### Final Verdict:
The program adheres to the problem description, correctly computes the desired output in all tested scenarios, and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
