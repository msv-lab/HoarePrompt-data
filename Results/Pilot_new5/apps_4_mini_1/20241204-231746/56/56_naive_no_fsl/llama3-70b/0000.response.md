To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and understand if it adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the required sum and the length of the sequence, respectively.

2. **Initial Condition**: The first condition checks if `n < k`. If this is true, it outputs "No". This is a necessary check because if the sum `n` is less than the number of integers `k`, it's impossible to form the required sum (since the smallest power of 2 is 1, and with `k` integers, the smallest achievable sum is `k`).

3. **Finding Powers of Two**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `a` to store the powers of 2.
   - It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 that can be subtracted from `n` (using `n.bit_length() - 1` to find the exponent).
   - It appends this exponent to the list `a` and reduces `n` accordingly until `n` either becomes zero or no more valid powers can be subtracted without exceeding `k`.

4. **Checking Length of Result**: After exiting the loop, it checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If this is the case, it outputs "No" because we cannot form a sequence of length `k`.

5. **Final Output**: If the length is sufficient, it trims `a` to the first `k` elements, sorts them in descending order, and outputs "Yes" followed by the sequence.

### Potential Issues:
- The program currently does not handle the case where there are remaining powers of 2 that could be split into smaller values to achieve exactly `k` integers. For instance, if `n` is such that the sum can be represented in fewer than `k` parts, we need to split larger powers into smaller parts to satisfy the requirement of exactly `k` integers. 

### Example Case That Fails:
Consider the input:
```
n = 7
k = 3
```
A valid sequence that sums to 7 is `[2, 2, 1]` (as `2^2 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 7`), which is of length 3. However, the code will find:
- It will find `2^2` and `2^1` (since `7 = 4 + 2 + 1`).
- This will result in `a` being `[2, 1, 0]` or something similar and will output "No" since it doesn't check for the ability to split powers to meet exactly `k` integers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases, specifically the case where it needs to split powers of two to achieve a total of `k` integers. Therefore, it lacks completeness in its logic.

Correctness: **False**
