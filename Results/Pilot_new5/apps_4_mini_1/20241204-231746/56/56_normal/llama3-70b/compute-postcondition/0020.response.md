The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is not specified, so we only note that it has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged in this step.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1; `i` is increased by 1; `a` is updated to include `x` in its list; `n` is now `n - 2**
