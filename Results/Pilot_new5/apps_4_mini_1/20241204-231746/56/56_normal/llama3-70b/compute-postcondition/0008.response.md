Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `i`, which is 0.***
