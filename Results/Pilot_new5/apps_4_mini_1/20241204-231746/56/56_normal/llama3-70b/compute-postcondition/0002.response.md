The code simply prints 'No', which does not change any of the variables. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions without any modifications.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` < `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; output is 'No'.**
