The value of `x` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. Since `n` is greater than 1, this will result in `x` being at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
