To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it satisfies the requirements stated in the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:

1. **Input**: Two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Output**: 
   - If no valid sequence exists, output "No".
   - If a valid sequence exists, output "Yes" followed by a sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of \(2^{a_i}\) equals `n`, and the largest integer in the answer is minimized while also being lexicographically largest.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if \( k > n \). In this case, it correctly returns "No" since it's impossible to have `k` integers whose powers of two sum to `n` if `k` is greater than `n`.

2. **Extracting Set Bits**:
   - The program then extracts the indices of set bits in the binary representation of `n` and stores them in the `bits` list. This is correct, as these indices represent contributions of powers of two that sum to `n`.

3. **Length Check**:
   - If the number of set bits is greater than `k`, "No" is returned. This is also correct since we cannot represent `n` with more than `k` integers.

4. **Balancing the Number of Parts**:
   - The program enters a loop to ensure that the number of elements in `bits` equals `k`. It does this by repeatedly taking the smallest bit, reducing it by 1, and adding two new entries for \(2^{\text{smallest}-1}\). This step effectively breaks down larger powers of two into smaller ones, which is a valid approach to increase the number of elements while keeping the condition that their contributions sum to `n`.

5. **Sorting**:
   - After ensuring `len(bits) == k`, the program sorts `bits` in descending order to provide the lexicographically largest output.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - Finally, it constructs the output correctly by joining the values in `bits` into a string.

### Conclusion:

The program successfully adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description:

- It checks if forming a sequence of `k` integers is possible based on the constraints given.
- It constructs a valid sequence whose powers of two sum to `n`.
- It ensures the sequence is of length `k`, minimizes the maximum integer, and is lexicographically largest.

Thus, the program correctly implements the solution to the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
