The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. Since `i` is 60, `bits` will now contain the integer 60. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 60, and `bits` now contains the value 60.**
