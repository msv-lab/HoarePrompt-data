The code `bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 58, to the list `bits`. The status of the other variables remains unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `k`, and whether the bits at positions 60 and 59 are set, do not affect the execution of the append operation.

Since `bits` is modified by the append operation, we note that the state of `bits` will now include the value 58.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58, and `bits` now includes the value 58.**
