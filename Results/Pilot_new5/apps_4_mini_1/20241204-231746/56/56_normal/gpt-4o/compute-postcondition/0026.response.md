To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the condition `len(bits) < k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `len(bits)` is currently less than `k + 1`, which means that `len(bits)` can be at most `k` since it cannot reach `k + 1` yet.
- Since `k` is a positive integer and `k ≤ n`, it is guaranteed that `k` is at least 1.
- The loop will execute again if `len(bits)` is still less than `k`.

Given the state provided:
- `len(bits)` is currently less than `k + 1`, which implies it could be equal to `k` or less than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must still be less than `k`, meaning it should be adjusted to below `k`.

In summary, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k`. Since `len(bits)` is already less than `k + 1`, we need to specify that `len(bits)` must also remain less than `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `len(bits)` is less than `k`, `smallest` is the last element that was in `bits`, `bits` includes `smallest - 1` as the last element.**
