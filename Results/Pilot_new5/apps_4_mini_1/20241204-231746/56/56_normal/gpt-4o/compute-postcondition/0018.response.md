According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the condition `len(bits) < k`. For the loop to execute, the length of the `bits` array must be less than the value of `k`. 

We know that:
- `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^5 \).
- `len(bits)` is currently less than or equal to `k`, as stated in the problem.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need `len(bits)` to be less than `k`. Since `len(bits)` is less than or equal to `k`, we have two scenarios:
1. If `len(bits)` is currently equal to `k`, then we need to adjust it to be less than `k`, which means `len(bits)` must be reduced to less than `k`.
2. If `len(bits)` is currently less than `k`, then the loop can execute right away, and no adjustments are necessary.

Since we do not have the exact value of `len(bits)`, we will assume the worst-case scenario where `len(bits) = k`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and len(bits) must be less than k**
