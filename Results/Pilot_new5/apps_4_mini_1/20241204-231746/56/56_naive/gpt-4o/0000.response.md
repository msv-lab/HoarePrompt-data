To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires finding `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of these integers equals `n`, with the condition that the largest integer in the answer is minimized and the sequence is lexicographically largest. 

### Breakdown of the Code
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check:** It checks if `k > n`, in which case it immediately returns 'No' because you cannot have `k` integers that sum to `n` if `k` is greater than `n`.
3. **Bit Extraction:** The program extracts the powers of `2` that add up to `n` by iterating from `60` down to `0`, checking which bits are set in `n`.
4. **Excess Check:** If the number of bits is greater than `k`, it returns 'No' since we cannot form a valid sequence of length `k`.
5. **Adjusting Length:** If the number of extracted bits is less than `k`, the program tries to adjust the sequence by decrementing the smallest extracted bit and duplicating it until the sequence reaches length `k`.
6. **Sorting:** Finally, it sorts the resulting sequence in descending order to ensure it is lexicographically largest.

### Verification of Edge Cases
1. **Case when `k > n`:** This case is handled correctly, returning 'No'.
2. **Case when `n` can be formed with fewer than `k` parts:** The extraction of bits works correctly, but what if `n` is very small (e.g., `n = 1`, `k = 5`)? The function should return 'Yes' and provide `-1 -1 -1 -1 -1`, which it does.
3. **Case with Large `n` and Small `k`:** For example, `n = 16`, `k = 2`, the output should be `Yes 4 0`, which the function will produce correctly.
4. **Negative Powers:** The code does not handle negative `k` and n properly in some cases like `k = 1, n = 1`. The requirement states that the integers can be negative, but the function doesn't state it explicitly, leading to confusion.

### Potential Failing Case
- If I test with `n = 3` and `k = 4`, this should not be possible as you cannot form `3` with 4 integers that satisfy the equation. The function would give 'Yes' but would incorrectly adjust to `-1 -1 -1 2`, which is not valid since it should have returned 'No'.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly with the adjustments made to the sequence. Therefore, based on the analysis, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements in every potential scenario.

Correctness: **False**.
