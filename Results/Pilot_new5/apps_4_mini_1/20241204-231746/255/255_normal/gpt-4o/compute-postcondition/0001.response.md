The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes new input from the user. The length of `s` will still remain equal to `n`, but the content of `s` will change based on the new input. The value of `n` remains the same as an integer input value, and it is still valid that `s` is a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of new user input.**
