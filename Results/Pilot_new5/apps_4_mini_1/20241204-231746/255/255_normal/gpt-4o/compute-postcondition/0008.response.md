The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `operations` is 2 if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, indicating that `operations` will now be 3 after the increment. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2**
