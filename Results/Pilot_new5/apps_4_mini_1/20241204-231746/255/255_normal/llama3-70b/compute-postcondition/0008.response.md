The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` is initially 2, after executing the code, `ans` becomes 3. The other variables, `n`, `s`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is 2 if the character at index 2 of `s` is different from the character at index 1 of `s`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is 2 if the character at index 2 of `s` is different from the character at index 1 of `s`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
