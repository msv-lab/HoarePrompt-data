According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` ranging from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 2. Since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `i` to reach 2).

State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2 if the character at index 2 of `s` is different from the character at index 1 of `s`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
