The program is designed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete a given string `s` by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

The program counts changes in characters as operations, which does not align with the described problem. The minimum number of operations should consider that multiple contiguous equal characters can be deleted in one operation, while the program incorrectly assumes each character change signifies a separate operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
aaabaaa
```
According to the problem description, you could delete "aaa" in one operation, leaving "baaa", then delete "aaa" again in the second operation, resulting in a total of only 2 operations. However, the provided program would count the transitions between 'a' and 'b' incorrectly, resulting in an output of 5 operations.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
