The statement `count[nc] -= 1` decreases the value of `count['C']` by 1, since `nc` is equal to 'C'. The initial value of `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`, and `avg` is defined as `n // 4`. After executing the code, the new value of `count['C']` will be `avg - count['C'] - 1`.

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the change in `count['C']`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C'] - 1`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` is 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, `res` is equal to `2 * nc`, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'C'**.
