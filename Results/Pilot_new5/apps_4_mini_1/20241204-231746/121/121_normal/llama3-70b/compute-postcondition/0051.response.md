Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the next character from `s`, `count['?']` remains 0, `res` is updated to include 'A', `nc` is 'A', and the current value of `count['A']` is now one less than its previous value, if `count['A']` was greater than 0. If `count['A']` is less than or equal to 0, no changes are made to `res`, `count['A']`, or the internal loop.***
