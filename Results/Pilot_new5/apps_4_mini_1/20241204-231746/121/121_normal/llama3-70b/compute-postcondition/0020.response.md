The value of `count[c]` is updated to be `avg - count[c]`. Here, `c` is 'G', so we replace `count[c]` with `count['G']`. The variable `avg` is already defined as `n // 4`. Therefore, the new value of `count['G']` becomes `avg - count['G']`, which translates to `n // 4 - count['G']`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `n // 4 - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `n // 4 - count['G']`, `count['T']` is the number of occurrences of 'T' in `s`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4, c` is 'G'**
