The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer that is constrained to be between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. However, the function doesn't return any specific output description in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` that follows the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an integer between 4 and 255) and a parameter s (a string of length n consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?').**
