Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the next character from `s`; if `count[nc]` was greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is updated to a value less than or equal to its previous value, `res` is updated to `res + nc`, no next `nc` exists for continuation of the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
