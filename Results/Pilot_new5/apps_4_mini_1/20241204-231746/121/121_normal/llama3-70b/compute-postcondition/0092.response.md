Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing characters from `s` with '?' replaced by 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their availability, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect their final decremented values while `count['?']` remains 0 and `avg` is equal to `n // 4`. If at least one of the counts in `count` is greater than 0, the replacements reflect this availability. Otherwise, if all values in `count` are 0, `res` is generated with '?' replaced accordingly, resulting in no characters available from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.***
