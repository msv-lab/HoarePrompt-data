Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, if `c` is equal to '?', `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are either equal to 0 or decremented based on their initial counts, and `res` contains the characters added in the order of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' until their counts reach 0 or are exhausted, with `nc` being the last character checked. If no characters were available, `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `c` is a character from `s` that is not equal to '?', `res` is updated to `res + c`.***
