Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a list containing 4 elements, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`. If the value at index `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, then that value is incremented by 1, `result[1]` and `result[2]` are both set to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
