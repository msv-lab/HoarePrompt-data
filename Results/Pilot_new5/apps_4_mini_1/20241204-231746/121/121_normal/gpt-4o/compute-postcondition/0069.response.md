The code assigns the value of `char` to `result[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer. Therefore, `result[n]` is assigned the value of `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` has at least `n + 2` characters, `char` is the next character in `counts`, `i` remains `n`, and `result[n]` is assigned the value of `char`.**
