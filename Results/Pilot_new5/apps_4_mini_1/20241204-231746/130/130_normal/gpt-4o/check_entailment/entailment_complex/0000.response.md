Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the requirements laid out in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Condition on New Coins**: The program calculates `min_x` based on the number of friends `M` and the requirement for new coins `L`. However, it doesn't adequately ensure that at least `L` coins will be new in Ivan's collection. It only checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. While this condition ensures that the total number of different coins being gifted does not exceed the number of coins that can be new, it does not guarantee that the gifts from all friends are new coins. 

2. **Invalid Case Handling**: In the problem description, if the number of friends `M` exceeds the number of different coins `N`, it should immediately return `-1`, as it's impossible for all friends to give different coins. The program does not explicitly handle this case before calculating `min_x`, which may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Potential Overflow Issue**: The program uses arithmetic operations with potentially large integers (up to \(10^{18}\)). While Python handles large integers, it does not explicitly check for any overflow conditions with respect to the constraints, which could lead to erroneous calculations in other programming languages.

4. **Logical Incorrectness**: The formula for `min_x` calculates a ceil value based on `L` and `M`, which may not accurately represent the minimum number of coins per friend needed to meet the conditions of the problem (specifically regarding the uniqueness of coins across all friends).

For example, consider the case where `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`. The program would incorrectly allow for `min_x` to be calculated without considering that each friend must give a unique coin, which isn't possible with only 10 different types of coins available.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the requirements of the problem description comprehensively, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
