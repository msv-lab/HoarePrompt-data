To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and how the program handles them.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `N`: The total number of different collectible coins.
   - `M`: The number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: The number of coins Ivan already possesses.
   - `L`: The minimum number of new coins that must be gifted to Ivan.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Each friend must give the same number of coins.
   - All coins given must be different.
   - At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Goals**:
   - Determine the minimal number of coins each friend can gift (`min_x`).
   - If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the inputs and calculates `min_x` using:
```python
min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
```
This computes the minimum number of coins each friend must give such that when multiplied by the number of friends `M`, it meets or exceeds `L`.

Then, it checks if the total number of coins that would be gifted (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of different coins available after accounting for the coins Ivan already has (`N - K`):
```python
if (M * min_x <= N - K):
    print(min_x)
else:
    print(-1)
```

### Logical Conditions
- **Sufficient Different Coins**: `M * min_x <= N - K` ensures that the number of different coins gifted does not exceed the total distinct coins available after removing the ones Ivan already possesses.
- **Minimum New Coins**: The computation of `min_x` guarantees that at least `L` new coins will be included, as the formula is designed to ensure that the total coins gifted equals or exceeds `L`.

### Edge Cases
1. If `M > N`, it is impossible for each friend to gift different coins. The program handles this case implicitly:
   - If `N - K` (remaining coins) is insufficient for `M`, it will result in `-1`.
  
2. If `L` exceeds `N - K`, which means there arenâ€™t enough new coins available, it also returns `-1`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It ensures:
- The minimum amount of coins each friend must give is calculated correctly.
- The conditions of distinctiveness and minimum new coins are checked properly.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **True**
