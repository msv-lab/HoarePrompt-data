The variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned new values based on user input after being mapped to integers. The initial conditions state that `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are all positive integers with the relationships `1 <= K <= N <= 10^18` and `1 <= M, L <= 10^18`. The previous values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are not specified since they will be replaced with new input values. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `L` is a positive integer; all values updated based on input.**
