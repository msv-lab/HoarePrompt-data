The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that N, M, K, and L are positive integers with the following relationships: 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18, and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly described without additional details about its return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters. It operates under the constraints that N, M, K, and L are positive integers with specific relationships, but the return value is not provided.**
