Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. Let's analyze the program's conditions against the requirements specified:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements**:
   - Ivan has `K` collectible coins out of `N` different coins.
   - He has `M` friends who need to gift him coins.
   - All coins must be different.
   - At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

2. **The Program's Logic**:
   - The program checks if `M` is greater than or equal to both `(N - K + 1)` and `L`.
   - If both conditions are true, it outputs `1`; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if the number of friends `M` is sufficient to cover all the coins that could be gifted, considering that Ivan already has `K` coins. The expression `N - K + 1` is incorrect for ensuring that there are enough friends to gift distinct coins.
   - The program does not correctly calculate how many coins each friend must gift to ensure that at least `L` coins are new. The problem states that the minimum number of coins each friend must gift should be determined, but the program just checks if the friends can meet the conditions without calculating the minimum coins each needs to gift.
   - If the total number of different coins `N` is less than `M`, the program does not account for the fact that it's impossible to satisfy the different coins condition. For instance, if `M = 11` and `N = 10`, regardless of `K` and `L`, it's impossible to give 11 different coins.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `10 11 2 4`:
     - Here, `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, `L = 4`. The program will return `-1`, which is correct because you cannot give 11 different coins out of only 10 available.
   - However, for input `20 15 2 3`, using `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, `L = 3`, the program returns `1`. This does not guarantee that at least 3 new coins can be given since it doesn't properly consider how many coins each friend must give.

In summary, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum coins each friend must gift and does not adequately enforce the constraints defined in the problem description. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is not aligned with the requirements stated in the problem.
