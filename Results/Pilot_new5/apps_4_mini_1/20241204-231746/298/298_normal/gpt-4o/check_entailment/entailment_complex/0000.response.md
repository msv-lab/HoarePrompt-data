To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in relation to the requirements specified in the problem.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. Vasya needs to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
   - \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
   - \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points must be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. If it's impossible to find such points, the program should print "NO". If possible, it should print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the three points.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `area = n * m / k` and checks if `area` is an integer. This is valid since for it to represent a true area, it must be a whole number.

2. **Checking Area Conditions**:
   - If `area` is not an integer, it prints "NO".
   - If `area` is zero, it also prints "NO".

3. **Output Points**:
   - If `area` is a valid positive integer, it proceeds to print "YES" and determines three points based on the conditions:
     - It checks if \(2 \times area \leq n\): If true, it prints the points `(0, 0)`, `(2 * area, 1)`, and `(0, 1)`.
     - If the above condition is false, it checks \(2 \times area \leq m\): If true, it prints `(1, 2 * area)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(0, 0)`.
     - If neither condition holds, it defaults to printing `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.

4. **Output Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the points are within the bounds given by \(n\) and \(m\) through its conditions:
     - By constructing points based on \(n\) and \(m\), it adheres to the constraints \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\).

### Conclusion on Correctness:
The program appears to follow the problem description closely:
- It correctly calculates the area and checks the necessary conditions to confirm if the triangle can be formed.
- It ensures that the points remain within the given bounds.
- The constructed points produce a triangle with the required area or appropriately identifies scenarios where such a triangle cannot be formed.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- For edge cases where \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are at their minimum or maximum values, the program logic still holds as it checks for valid integer area and adjusts points accordingly.

### Final Verdict:
Given that the program fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
