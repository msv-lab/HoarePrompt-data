The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it appears that the function's output is determined by the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, without specific output conditions or return statements related to these variables in the function body, it's unclear how they influence the function's behavior. 

Assuming the function would typically process inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` (though they are not explicitly passed as parameters), we can categorize potential cases for output based on their values:

1. **Case_1**: If certain conditions related to `n`, `m`, and `k` are met (not specified), the function could return a specific result.
2. **Case_2**: If alternate conditions are met, it could return a different result.

However, since we do not know the specifics of what these conditions are or how the function processes these inputs, we cannot provide a definitive description of the functionality.

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the absence of specific case outputs in the description, we can summarize as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is dependent on the internal logic regarding unspecified conditions related to integers n, m, and k. Without specific output conditions, the functionality cannot be fully described.**
