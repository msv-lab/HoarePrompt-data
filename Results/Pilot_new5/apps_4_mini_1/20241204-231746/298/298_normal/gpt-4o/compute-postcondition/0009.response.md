The code `print('YES')` simply outputs the string 'YES' to the console. It does not modify any variables in the program. Therefore, the states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, confirmed to be an integer, and `area` is not equal to 0.**
