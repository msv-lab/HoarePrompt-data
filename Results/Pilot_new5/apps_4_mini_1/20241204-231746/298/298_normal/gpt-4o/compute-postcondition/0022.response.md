Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, confirmed to be an integer and not equal to 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the output printed is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and the output printed is '0 {m // 2}'. Otherwise, the output is '0 {m // 2}'.***
