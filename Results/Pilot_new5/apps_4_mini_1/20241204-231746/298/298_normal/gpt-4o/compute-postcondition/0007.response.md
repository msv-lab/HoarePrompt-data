The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' but does not change any variable values. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` retain their previous states. The output does not affect the values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, confirmed to be an integer. The current value of `area` is 0, and 'NO' has been printed.**
