The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the condition that `b` is not equal to zero. If `b` is equal to zero, the function would not operate correctly. 

1. If a specific condition is met (not detailed here), the function returns `1` and `0`.
2. In another case, the function returns a tuple consisting of `y` and the result of `x` minus the integer division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not equal to zero) and return different outputs based on a condition, including either a pair of integers or a tuple involving an integer `y` and a computed value based on `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is not equal to zero. It returns either 1 and 0 or a tuple consisting of y and a calculated value based on a and b.**
