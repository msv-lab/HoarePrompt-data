To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
2. \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Code Analysis:
1. The first check ensures that \(n \cdot m\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it prints "NO".
2. The second part calls `func_3(n, m)` which seems to utilize the extended Euclidean algorithm to find two coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) along with a linear combination result.
3. Based on the output of `func_3`, it checks if the absolute value of \(n1 \cdot m\) is greater than or equal to \(g\) (the computed value from `func_3`).
4. If the condition is satisfied, it prints the triangle points. If not, it prints "NO".

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output descriptions for functions provide insight into their functionality:
  - `func_1` computes the GCD.
  - `func_2` is implementing the extended Euclidean algorithm and provides coefficients for the linear combination.
  - `func_3` utilizes `func_2` and returns the coefficients along with the linear combination result.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Divisibility**: The check for \(n \cdot m \mod k\) only checks if it is non-zero. However, it might not guarantee valid integer points (for edge cases where \(k\) is larger than \(n \cdot m\) and thus leads to an area of zero or negative).
2. **Area Calculation**: The area must be an integer, and hence the triangle's vertices must also correspond to integer coordinates within specified limits.
3. **Triangle Validity**: The points chosen must be distinct and should actually form a triangle rather than being collinear.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program only checks divisibility and does not adequately confirm the validity of the points or handle cases where the expected area may not lead to valid integer points, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements comprehensively.

For instance, if \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 3\), the area would be \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\), which cannot yield integer coordinates, yet the check for \(n \cdot m \mod k\) passes because \(1 \mod 3 \neq 0\) leads to "YES" printing invalid coordinates.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
