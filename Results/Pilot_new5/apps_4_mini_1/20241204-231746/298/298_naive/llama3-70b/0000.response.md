To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements and the code. 

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
  - \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
  - \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
  - The area of the triangle formed by these points should equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\). 

### Program Analysis:
1. The program checks if \(n \times m\) modulo \(k\) is non-zero, in which case it outputs "NO". This is a necessary condition since if the area is not an integer, a triangle with that area cannot be formed.
   
2. The function `func_3` is invoked to compute values based on the two integers \(n\) and \(m\). This function likely computes some values related to the gcd (greatest common divisor) based on the Euclidean algorithm.

3. The program checks if \(|n1 \times m|\) is greater than or equal to \(g\). If true, it prints "YES" and provides three points. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:
- The program does not explicitly check if the computed area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is valid and can be achieved by integer coordinates. For example, if \( k \) divides \( nm \) perfectly, but the required area is such that it's not feasible to form a triangle with integer coordinates within the set bounds.
  
- A specific case that might fail:
  - For \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\): 
    - The area calculation gives \(\frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5\). Since the area must be an integer, this should return "NO". The program does check this but it doesn't ensure that the coordinates selected will always lead to forming a valid triangle that meets the area criteria.

### Conclusion:
The program lacks comprehensive checks to ensure that the outputs \(x_i, y_i\) actually yield the required area. There could be scenarios where the area condition is satisfied mathematically, but cannot be achieved with valid integer coordinates. 

Therefore, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when it comes to checking if a valid triangle can be formed with integer coordinates that meet the area requirements.
