To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to check if we can make matrix B (initially filled with zeros) equal to matrix A using a series of 2x2 operations.
2. Each operation replaces a specific 2x2 submatrix of B with 1s based on the condition that the corresponding 2x2 block in A must have all 1s.
3. If it's impossible to transform B into A, the output should be -1.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```

### Logic Evaluation:
1. The program iterates over each possible position of the top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in A.
2. It checks if all four values in the 2x2 submatrix are 1. If they are, it continues to the next position.
3. If any of the four values are 1 (but not all), it marks the operation at `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which is incorrect because we can't just operate on partially filled 2x2 areas.
4. The program does not check whether the final configuration of B is exactly equal to A after all operations, which is crucial to verifying if we can transform B into A.

### Edge Case:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 0
1 0
```
For this matrix A:
- The program would evaluate the (0,0) block and see that not all are 1, so it would record an operation for (1,1), which is incorrect since that operation does not help in achieving the final matrix A.
- It should immediately recognize that it cannot create the required configuration in B, as we cannot turn the (1,0) into a 1.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify some configurations of A where B cannot be made equal to A. Specifically, it does not address the situation where partial operations do not produce the required output. 

Correctness: **False**.
