According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range for `i` is `range(n - 1)`. Since it is given that `n` is at least 2, this condition is satisfied.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take values from 0 to `n - 2`, meaning that at the beginning of the first iteration, `i` will be 0. The variables `A` and `ops` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed:
- `n` must be at least 2 (which is already given).
- `i` should be initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `ops` is an empty list**.
