According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `ops`. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more element in `ops` after the last executed one. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ops` is not empty, meaning it contains at least one tuple (k, l) that satisfies the given condition regarding `A`. The loop iterates over each element in `ops`, so the index of the current operation must be incremented to reflect the next element.

Since the current operation has been processed, we need to adjust the state to indicate that we are moving to the next operation. The size of `ops` must be at least one greater than the current index to allow for another iteration. Thus, we will denote the next operation as `op` and ensure that `ops` has at least one more element to process.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` must contain at least one more tuple, op must be the next operation in the list.**
