Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, if the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, then no additional conditions are specified for `ops`. Otherwise, `ops` is a list of tuples containing (k, l) where at least one of `A[k-1][l-1]`, `A[k][l-1]`, `A[k-1][l]`, or `A[k][l]` is equal to 1, and the length of `ops` is the total number of tuples printed.***
