The variable `ops` is modified by appending the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which evaluates to `(3, 2)` since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. The conditions regarding the values of `A[2][1]`, `A[3][1]`, `A[2][0]`, and `A[3][0]` do not affect the execution of the append operation because the code does not depend on whether the conditions are met; it only determines whether to append to `ops`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` is appended with (3, 2).**
