The code appends a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, after executing the code, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but the `ops` list will now contain the tuple `(1, 1)` as `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1).**
