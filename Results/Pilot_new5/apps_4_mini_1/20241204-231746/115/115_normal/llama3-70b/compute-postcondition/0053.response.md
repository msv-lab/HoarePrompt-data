Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `A[2][1]` is 1 or `A[3][1]` is 1 or `A[2][2]` is 1 or `A[3][2]` is 1, then the `ops` list is appended with (3, 2). If none of these conditions are met, the `ops` list remains unchanged.***
