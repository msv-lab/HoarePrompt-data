The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` evaluate to 2. Therefore, the tuple `(2, 2)` is added to `ops`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` includes the tuple (2, 2)**.
