Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the values of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, and `A[2][1]` are all equal to 1, we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues executing without skipping.***
