The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no explicit loop context provided in the current state, we can only note that the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

In this case, `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` retain their previous values, and the program execution skips any subsequent code that follows the `continue` statement within its loop context.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we skip the rest of the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we skip the rest of the current iteration.**
