To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have two matrices, `A` (with elements 0 or 1) and `B` (initially all 0s).
2. We can perform operations on `B` by selecting a `2x2` submatrix and setting its elements to 1.
3. Our goal is to determine if we can make `B` equal to `A` using the allowed operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and then reads matrix `A`.
2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the matrix `A` from the top left corner, checking for `2x2` blocks.
   - If all four elements of the current `2x2` block are `1`, it continues to the next block.
   - If at least one of the four elements is `1`, it adds the operation to the list `ops`.
3. **Output Handling**:
   - If the number of operations exceeds 2500, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

### Key Points of Consideration:
- The program checks blocks of `A` and records operations based on the presence of `1`s.
- However, it does not account for cases where it might be impossible to achieve `A` by simply recording positions where there's at least one `1`. For example:
  - If there exists a `1` that is part of an isolated `1` in matrix `A` (not forming a complete `2x2` block), it will not be able to set it in `B` because `B` can only be modified in blocks of `2x2`.
  
### Failure Case:
Consider the following matrix `A`:
```
1 0
0 0
```
The only `1` in `A` is at position `(0, 0)`, and there is no way to perform a `2x2` operation to make `B` equal to `A`. The program would not recognize that it is impossible to achieve the desired matrix `A` and would incorrectly create an operation for `(1, 1)` due to the presence of `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that all `1`s in matrix `A` can be formed by `2x2` blocks in `B`. As a result, it can produce incorrect outputs for certain configurations of matrix `A`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
