The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list containing the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, we can calculate the new values as follows:

- `i + 1` is `(n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `j + 1` is `0 + 1`, which simplifies to `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The output state needs to reflect the updated values and the fact that a new tuple has been added to the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1, `operations` has a new entry `(n, 1)`**.
