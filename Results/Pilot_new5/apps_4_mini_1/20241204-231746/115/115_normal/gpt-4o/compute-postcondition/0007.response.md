Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `operations` contains one tuple: `(i + 1, 1)`, and `B` has the same dimensions as `A`, with all elements being 0 except for `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, which are all equal to 1. The variable `j` remains 0.***
