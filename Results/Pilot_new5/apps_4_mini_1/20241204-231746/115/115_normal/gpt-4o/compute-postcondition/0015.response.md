Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B` has updated values `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, m)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
