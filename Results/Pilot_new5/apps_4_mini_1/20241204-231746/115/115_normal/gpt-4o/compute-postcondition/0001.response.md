The code assigns a new 2D list `B` that contains `n` rows and `m` columns, with all elements initialized to 0. The value of `B` will be a list of lists, where each inner list consists of `m` zeros. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `operations` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1; `operations` is an empty list; `B` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is 0.**
