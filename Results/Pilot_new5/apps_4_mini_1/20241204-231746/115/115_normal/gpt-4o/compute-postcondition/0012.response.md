According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be the value that makes the loop run one last time. 

Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the final value of `j` after the last iteration will be `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase to `m - 1`, which means that `m` must be greater than 2 (since `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 50).

Given that `j` will increment by 1, the next value of `j` will be `m - 1`. Therefore, the states should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, operations contains an additional tuple (i + 1, 2), `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `j` is `m - 1`**
