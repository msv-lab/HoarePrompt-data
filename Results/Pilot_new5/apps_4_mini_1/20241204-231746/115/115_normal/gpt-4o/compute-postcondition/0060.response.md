According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. Since `n` is at least 2, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, and the elements A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal for all j from 0 to m-1.**
