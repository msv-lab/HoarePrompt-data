The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are previously defined, with `j` being initialized to `1`. Therefore, `j + 1` becomes `2`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is used in the expression `i + 1`. 

The output state will reflect that `operations` now includes an additional tuple based on the values of `i` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` contains one tuple: (i + 1, 1) and now contains an additional tuple (i + 1, 2), `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`, and `j` is 1.**
