According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute a second time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, `j` will be 2 and `m` must remain at least 2 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the elements A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal.**
