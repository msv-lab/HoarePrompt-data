The code snippet modifies a 2D array `B` at specific indices based on the current values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m`. Specifically, it sets the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. The variables `n` and `m` are still integers within their defined ranges, and `j` is equal to `m`.

Since we don't have specific values for `i`, `j`, or `B`, we cannot determine the exact indices being modified or the values before and after the assignment, but we know that `j` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `j` is equal to `m`; `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1.**
