The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The variable `j` has been defined as `m - 1`, so when calculating `j + 1`, it equals `m`. Thus, the tuple that will be appended to `operations` is `(i + 1, m)`.

The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `j` are still valid, but now we have updated the state of the `operations` list with the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `j` is `m - 1`; `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, m)`**.
