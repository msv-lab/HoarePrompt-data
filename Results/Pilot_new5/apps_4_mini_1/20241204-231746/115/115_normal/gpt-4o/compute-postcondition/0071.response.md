To analyze the output state after the loop executes completely, we first need to understand that the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. In each iteration, it checks if the elements in arrays `A` and `B` are equal at the specified indices. If any pair of elements is not equal, the function would return `-1` and exit, but since we are determining the output state after all iterations, we will assume all elements are equal.

Considering the initial state and the conditions necessary for the loop to execute, we derive the following facts:

1. The loop will execute exactly `m` times, given that `m` is at least 2.
2. The variable `j` will take values from `0` to `m-1` during the iterations.
3. The condition `A[i][j] == B[i][j]` must hold true for each iteration from `j = 0` to `j = m-1`.

Given that the loop executes all its iterations without returning `-1`, we can state the output:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, and A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all j from 0 to m-1; specifically, A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all values of j in the range [0, m-1].**
