Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[n-1][2]`, `B[n-1][3]`, `B[n][2]`, and `B[n][3]` are all set to 1, and the `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 3)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
