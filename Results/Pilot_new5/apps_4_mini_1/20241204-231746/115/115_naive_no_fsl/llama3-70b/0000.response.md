To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its logic and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The program is supposed to take two matrices, `A` and `B`, and determine if it is possible to make `B` equal to `A` using specific operations. The operations allow us to set values in a `2 x 2` submatrix of `B` to `1`. 

1. **Initialization**: It reads the dimensions of matrix `A` (which is equivalent to `B` initialized to all zeroes).
2. **Operation Collection**: It iterates through each cell in matrix `A`, checking the conditions for performing the operation. If it finds a `2 x 2` block of `1`s in `A`, it does nothing. If it finds any `1` in adjacent cells (thus implying a potential need for an operation), it appends the corresponding operation to the list of operations `ops`.
3. **Output**: The program checks if the length of the operations exceeds `2500`, and prints `-1` if it does. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Issue Identification

The primary issue with the logic resides in how it determines the operations. Specifically, the check to append operations is flawed because it does not ensure that performing the operation will actually transform `B` to match `A`. For example, if `A` has a `1` at positions that are not part of a valid `2 x 2` block, the program may still append an operation inappropriately, resulting in a situation where `B` cannot match `A`.

### Test Case Where Program Fails

Consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 0
0 0
```

For this input:
- The matrix `A` is:
```
1 0
0 0
```
- The program will iterate through the only `2 x 2` block available:
  - At position `(0, 0)`, it finds a `1` at `A[0][0]` but `A[0][1]` is `0`, so it appends an operation `(1, 1)` (which corresponds to the operation that would set `B[0][0], B[0][1], B[1][0], B[1][1]` to `1`).
  
After this operation, matrix `B` would look like:
```
1 1
1 1
```
This matrix does not match matrix `A`, indicating that it is impossible to transform `B` to match `A` through the allowed operations. However, the program would produce an invalid result by suggesting that an operation could be performed.

### Conclusion

Given the outlined issue and the specific test case where the program fails to transform `B` to match `A` correctly, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
