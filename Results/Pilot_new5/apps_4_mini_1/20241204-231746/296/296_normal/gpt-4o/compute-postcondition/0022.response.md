Postcondition: ***`divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`, `i` is the last integer checked (up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, and the current value of `divisors` is empty (i.e., there are no divisors found for `n` other than 1 and `n`).***
