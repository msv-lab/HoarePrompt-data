The loop iterates over integers from 2 to the integer square root of `n`, checking if each integer is a divisor of `n`. If a divisor is found, it is added to the `divisors` list along with its complementary divisor `n // i`, if they are not equal.

Thus, the possible values for `i` will range from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and the `divisors` list will contain all unique divisors of `n` that were found during these iterations.

If the loop executes a total of `k` times, the values and relationships of the variables are as follows:

1. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2.
2. If the loop executed `k` times, it means there were `k` integers `i` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))` that the loop checked to see if they were divisors of `n`.
3. The `divisors` list will contain all divisors of `n` found during the iterations, including pairs of divisors if they are different.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`, `i` is the last integer checked (up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2.**
