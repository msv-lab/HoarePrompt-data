The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The value of `i` is 4, and since the initial state does not specify `divisors`, we assume it is a list that is modified when the code is executed. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its value is still greater than or equal to 16.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `divisors` now includes 4**.
