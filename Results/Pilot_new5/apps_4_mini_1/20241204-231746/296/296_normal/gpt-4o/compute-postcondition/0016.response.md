According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 9, we can calculate `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which will be at least 3 (since square root of 9 is 3). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 4, which implies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 16 (since the square root of 16 is 4).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
