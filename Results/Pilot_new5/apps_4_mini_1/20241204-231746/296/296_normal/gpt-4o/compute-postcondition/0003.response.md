The code initializes an empty list called `divisors`. The variable `n` retains its previous state, which is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. The other variable `divisors` is now an empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list.**
