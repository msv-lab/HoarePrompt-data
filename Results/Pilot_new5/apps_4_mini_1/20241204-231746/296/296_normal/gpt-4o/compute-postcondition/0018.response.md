The code appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16 and `i` is 4, we can evaluate the expression `n // i`. The result of `n // i` will be at least `16 // 4`, which is 4. Therefore, `divisors` will now include the value of `n // 4`, which can vary depending on the actual value of `n`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated contents of the `divisors` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `divisors` now includes 4 and also the value of `n // 4`.**
