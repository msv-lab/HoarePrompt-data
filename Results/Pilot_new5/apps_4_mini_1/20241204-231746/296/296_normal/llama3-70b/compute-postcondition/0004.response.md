The code prints 'YES', and the value of `n` remains unchanged. There are no other variable changes or impacts from the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2; the output is 'YES'.**
