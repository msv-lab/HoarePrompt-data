The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on a given condition that `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, without additional details about the output for different scenarios, it is unclear what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified.**
