Let's break down the provided program and see if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
We need to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
- \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
- \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \)
- The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Case when \( n = 2 \)**: The program outputs 'NO', which is correct because there aren't any valid \( b_i \) values since \( b_i \) must satisfy \( 1 < b_i < n \).
  
2. **Case when \( n > 2 \)**: The program outputs 'YES' followed by two fractions \( \frac{1}{(n//2)} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \). Here, the program assumes:
   - \( b_1 = n // 2 \) and \( b_2 = n \)
   - For both cases, it is checking if \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and fits the requirements.

### Edge Cases:
- For odd \( n \), \( n // 2 \) will not be a divisor of \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \) cannot be guaranteed.
  
- The program does not handle the case when \( n \) is a prime number greater than 2 properly. For example, if \( n = 3 \), the only divisors are 1 and 3 (which are not valid according to the problem constraints).

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints specify that the function does not return a value and provides a summary of the function's behavior. They state what is printed based on the input \( n \). The hints are accurate about the function's outputs for the cases when \( n = 2 \) and \( n > 2 \).

However, they do not address the fact that the fractions are not guaranteed to satisfy the requirements of the problem for all \( n > 2 \). Specifically, it does not check if \( n // 2 \) is a valid denominator that divides \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for all possible cases as outlined in the problem description. For example:
- If \( n = 3 \), it would incorrectly print 'YES' and the fractions \( \frac{1}{1.5} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \), which is invalid because \( b_i \) must be a divisor of \( n \) and also greater than 1.

Thus, since the program fails to handle cases correctly, especially odd \( n \) and prime \( n \), the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**.
