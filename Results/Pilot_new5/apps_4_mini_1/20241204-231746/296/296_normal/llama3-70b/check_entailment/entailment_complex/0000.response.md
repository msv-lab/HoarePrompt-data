Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Handling of Input n = 2**: The problem states that we must find a sequence of fractions for any positive integer \( n \) such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). According to the problem description, for \( n = 2 \), it is indeed true that there are no fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) that satisfy the conditions given (as \( b_i \) must be greater than 1 and less than \( n \)). However, the program outputs 'NO' correctly for \( n = 2 \), but this is only a specific case and does not represent the whole logic required by the problem description.

2. **Output for n > 2**: When \( n > 2 \), the program outputs 'YES' and then prints two fractions: \( \frac{1}{n // 2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \). The problem specifies that for each \( b_i \) (which is \( n // 2 \) and \( n \) in this case), it must hold that \( 1 < b_i < n \). However, for \( n = 3 \), \( n // 2 \) would result in 1, which does not satisfy the condition \( 1 < b_i < n \). 

3. **Validation of the Sum**: The program does not verify the sum \( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It simply outputs two fractions without confirming that they indeed add up to the required value. For example, \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \), which is not equal to \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) for \( n = 6 \), but it does not work for all other values of \( n \) in general.

4. **General Case Handling**: The program lacks a generalized approach to finding fractions for larger \( n \). It only provides a specific output format for \( n > 2 \) without considering the divisors of \( n \), which is a critical part of the problem (where \( b_i \) must divide \( n \)).

Thus, since the program fails to cover the general case correctly and does not ensure the conditions set out in the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
