The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state, so `target_sofa` will be equal to the new value of `i` (which is now `i + 1`) plus 1, resulting in `target_sofa = (i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`. The variables `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` remain unchanged. The condition states that `d` must still be greater than `i + 1`, which is now the previous value of `i` before incrementing. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `target_sofa`.

Output State: **`right_count` remains unchanged, `left_count` remains unchanged, `bottom_count` remains unchanged, `top_count` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `target_sofa` is equal to `i + 2`, and `d` must be greater than `i + 1 (previous value of i)`**
