To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information carefully. The loop is defined as follows:

```
for j in range(d):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we know the following variables are modified based on certain conditions involving `y1`, `y2`, `x1`, `x2`, along with some indexed counts: `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the variable `j`:

1. The loop iterates over `j`, starting from 0 up to `d-1`. 
2. If the loop has completed its last iteration, `j` would be equal to `d-1`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented.
3. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be equal to `d`, which means `d` must be increased by 1.
4. Consequently, the values of `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` will remain unchanged, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state to reflect this scenario at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`right_count[i]` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` is unchanged, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `j` is `d`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged.**
