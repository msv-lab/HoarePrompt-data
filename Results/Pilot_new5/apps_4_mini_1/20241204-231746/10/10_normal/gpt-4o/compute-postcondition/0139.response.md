Postcondition: ***`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2. If `i` equals `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, there are no operations performed.***
