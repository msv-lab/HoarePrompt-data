The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on the input received and converted to integers using `map(int, input().strip().split())`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, but they will take on integer values from the input. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is an empty list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned integer values from input.**
