Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` are all increased by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, while `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged.***
