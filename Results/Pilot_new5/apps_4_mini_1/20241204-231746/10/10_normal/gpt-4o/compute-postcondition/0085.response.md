The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial states of `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` are unchanged. The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are also unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is increased by 1; `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` are unchanged; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged.**
