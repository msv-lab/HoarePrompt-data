The variable `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `y1`, `y2_j`, `y2`, and `y1_j` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The relationships between the variables maintain their integrity, and since the code snippet only affects `right_count[i]`, we only update that specific variable.

Output State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1**.
