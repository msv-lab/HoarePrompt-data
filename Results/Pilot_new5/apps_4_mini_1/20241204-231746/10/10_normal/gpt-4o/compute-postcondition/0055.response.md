The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected, so we retain their previous states in the output. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `left_count[i]`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
