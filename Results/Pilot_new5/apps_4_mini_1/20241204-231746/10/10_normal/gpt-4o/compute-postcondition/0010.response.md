The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned by taking space-separated input and converting them to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged. The variable `sofas` will now include an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` after the input is processed, but these specific values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will depend on the user input.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 3; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `sofas` is a list containing tuples now including an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers from input.**
