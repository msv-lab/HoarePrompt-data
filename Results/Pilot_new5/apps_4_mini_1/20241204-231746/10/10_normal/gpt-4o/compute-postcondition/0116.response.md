Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is increased by 1, while `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` retain their previous values. Additionally, `d` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are both greater than `x2_j`.***
