Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `j` is set to `d`, with `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` assigned the values from `sofas[d]` if `i` is not equal to `j`.***
