The value of `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, including `d`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, along with the condition related to `bottom_count[0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `top_count[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1**
