Postcondition: ***If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, and if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, and if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` is updated to `left_count[i] + 1`, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `top_count[i]` is increased by 1, while `d` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged. If the condition involving `y1` and `y2` is not met, then no changes occur in the counts or the other variables.***
