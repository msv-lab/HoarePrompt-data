Postcondition: ***`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. If both `y1` and `y2` are greater than `y2_j`, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If not, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged if `i` equals `j`, or are updated to the values from `sofas[j]` if `i` is not equal to `j.`***
