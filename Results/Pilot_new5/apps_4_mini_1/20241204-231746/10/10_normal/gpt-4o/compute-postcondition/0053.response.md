The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0, indicating that the first element of `right_count` is affected. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, and `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.
