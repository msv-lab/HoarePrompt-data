The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged, and `top_count[i]` remains unchanged as well. The conditions for `d`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `bottom_count[i]`.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `top_count[i]` remains unchanged; `d` is greater than 0 and greater than `i + 1`; both `x1` and `x2` are less than `x1_j`, both `x1` and `x2` are greater than `x2_j`; `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
