Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` remain unchanged. If the conditions `left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b` are met, then `i` is set to `previous_i + 1`, `target_sofa` is set to `previous_i + 2`, and `d` is greater than `previous_i + 2`, allowing the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
