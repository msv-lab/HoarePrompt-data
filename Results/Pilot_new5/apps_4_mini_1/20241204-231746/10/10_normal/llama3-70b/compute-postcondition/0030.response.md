Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 3 sofas, `s` is the next sofa in the list, `top` remains unchanged. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `left` may be increased by 1 and `right` is increased by 1. If `sofa[0][0]` is not greater than `s[0][0]` but still satisfies the condition, the state remains unchanged.***
