Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1. The first coordinate of `sofa[0]` is equal to the first coordinate of `s`, and the second coordinate of `sofa[0]` is greater than that of `s`. Therefore, `left`, `right`, and `top` have each been incremented by 1.***
