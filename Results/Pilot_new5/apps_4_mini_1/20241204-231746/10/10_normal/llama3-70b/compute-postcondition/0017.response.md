The value of `left` is incremented by 1, while all other variables, including `sofa`, `s`, `d`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the list (`sofa[1]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, and `left` is incremented by 1.
