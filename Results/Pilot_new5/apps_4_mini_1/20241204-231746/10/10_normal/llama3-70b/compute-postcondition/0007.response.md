The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `s` is not equal to the first sofa in `sofa`. The first element of `sofa` has a first coordinate greater than that of `s` and the second coordinate of `sofa[0]` is equal to the second coordinate of `s`; `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `s` is not equal to the first sofa in `sofa`.
