Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the list. If the x-coordinate of the first sofa is less than that of the second sofa and their y-coordinates are the same, `left` is incremented by 1 while `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged while `right`, `top`, and `bottom` also remain unchanged.***
