Output State: **`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of `d` sofas, where `d` is greater than or equal to 0. `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` represent the counts of sofas positioned relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there are no other sofas, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 0. If there are other sofas, their counts will depend on their coordinates relative to `sofa[0]` based on the conditions described in the loop.**
