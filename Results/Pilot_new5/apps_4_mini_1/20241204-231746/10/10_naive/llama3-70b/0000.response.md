To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation and ensure it accurately satisfies the requirements for all potential input cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given a matrix representing a storehouse with `d` sofas, each defined by two coordinates.
2. The criteria to determine Grandpa Maks's sofa are based on the number of other sofas located in specific positions relative to it (left, right, top, bottom).
3. The output should be the number (1-based index) of the sofa that meets the specified counts, or -1 if no such sofa exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
- Reads the number of sofas and their respective positions.
- It also reads the expected counts of sofas in relation to Grandpa Maks's sofa (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b).
- For each sofa, it calculates how many sofas are positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom using the `func_1` function.
- If it finds a sofa that matches the expected counts, it outputs that sofa's index; otherwise, it returns -1.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Coordinate Comparison Logic**: The function `func_1` compares only the `x` coordinate for left/right and the `y` coordinate for top/bottom, but it does not handle the case where the two positions of a sofa do not align as expected. Specifically, it assumes that the first coordinate in the tuple is always the "upper" or "left" sofa. This could lead to errors in counting.

2. **Correctness of Counting Logic**: The counting logic checks only for equality of `y` for left/right and `x` for top/bottom. This might miss cases where a sofa is diagonally placed relative to another. For example:
   - If sofa A is at (1, 1) and sofa B is at (2, 2), the code currently does not account that sofa B is actually below and to the right of sofa A, which should not contribute to counts.

### Example Case to Highlight Issues:
Consider an example where we have:
- 2 sofas:
  1. (1, 1) to (1, 2)
  2. (2, 1) to (2, 2)
  
  And the expected counts are:
  - cnt_l = 0
  - cnt_r = 1
  - cnt_t = 0
  - cnt_b = 0

For the first sofa (1, 1) to (1, 2), it would correctly determine that there is 1 sofa to its right, but it will incorrectly count any potential sofas based on the incorrect logic in `func_1`, especially if an additional sofa was added at (1, 3).

### Conclusion:
Since the program's counting logic is flawed, as it does not consider all necessary comparisons and may yield incorrect results based on the misinterpretation of the sofa positions, the correctness of the program is in question. 

Correctness: **False**.
