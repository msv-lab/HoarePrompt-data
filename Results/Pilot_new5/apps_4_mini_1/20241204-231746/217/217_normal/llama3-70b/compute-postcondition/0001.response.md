In the provided code snippet, `a` is reassigned to a new list created by taking input and converting it to integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the length of the list `a`, which will now match the number of integers inputted.

The impact of the code indicates that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input; the input integers must satisfy the condition -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, but the specific content of `a` will depend on the input provided at runtime. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from input, where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from input, where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100**
