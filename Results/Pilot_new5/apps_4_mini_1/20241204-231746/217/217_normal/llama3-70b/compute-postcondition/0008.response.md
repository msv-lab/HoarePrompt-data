`c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is given as an odd integer index. The list `a` contains integers satisfying the condition -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, thus `a[i]` will also satisfy that condition. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `c + a[i]`, `i` is an integer that is odd (i % 2 != 0).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `c + a[i]`, `i` is an integer that is odd (i % 2 != 0)**
