Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. If `i` is even, `b` is updated to the previous value of `b` plus `a[i]`, `c` is set to 0, and `i` is now `i + 1`. If `i` is odd, `b` is set to 0, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, and `i` is now `i + 1.***
