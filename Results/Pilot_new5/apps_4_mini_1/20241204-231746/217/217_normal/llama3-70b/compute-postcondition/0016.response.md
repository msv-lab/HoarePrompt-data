The value of `c` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Given that `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and thus the new index `i` will be valid for accessing the list `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` can be updated or set to 0 depending on the parity of the new `i`, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, `i` is now `i + 1`**.
