The code `b += a[i]` increments `b` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is currently 0 and we know `i` is even (as stated in the initial state), `b` will be updated with the value of the first element of the list `a`. The other variables are not impacted by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus `a[0]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0.**
