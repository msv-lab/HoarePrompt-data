According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly relevant to the ability of the loop to execute, but they are part of the initial state. At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` will range from `0` to `n-1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
