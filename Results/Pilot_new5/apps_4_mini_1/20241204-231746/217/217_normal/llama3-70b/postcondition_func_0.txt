The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It sorts the list `a` in descending order and calculates the difference between the sum of integers at even indices and the sum of integers at odd indices in the sorted list. It then prints this difference.
