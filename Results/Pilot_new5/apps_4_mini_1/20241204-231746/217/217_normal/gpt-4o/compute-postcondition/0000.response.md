The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect that `n` is now a specific integer value inputted by the user, while `a` remains a list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (specific value from input), and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
