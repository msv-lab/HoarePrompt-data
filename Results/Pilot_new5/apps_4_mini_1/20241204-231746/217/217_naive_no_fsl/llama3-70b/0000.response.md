To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The program attempts to maximize the expression \( B - C \) by:
1. Sorting the array in descending order.
2. Distributing elements alternatively into two sums \( B \) and \( C \), where elements at even indices go to \( B \) and elements at odd indices go to \( C \).

However, let's examine a potential edge case to see if the program correctly finds the maximum possible value of \( B - C \).

Consider the input:
```
3
-1 -2 -3
```

For this input:
- The sorted array would be `[-1, -2, -3]`.
- According to the program's logic:
  - \( B \) would be `-1` (from the first element).
  - \( C \) would be `-2` (from the second element).
  - The last element `-3` would not be added to either \( B \) or \( C \).
- Thus the program calculates \( B - C = -1 - (-2) = 1 \).

However, the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) can actually be achieved by putting all elements into \( B \) (since both of them are negative, making \( C \) zero):
- \( B = -1 + (-2) + (-3) = -6 \)
- \( C = 0 \)
- Therefore, \( B - C = -6 - 0 = -6 \).

In this case, the program produces an incorrect result based on the logic outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
