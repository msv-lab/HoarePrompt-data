Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). This aligns with the problem description which specifies that these are the inputs needed.

2. **Calculating Minimum Sets**: The program calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be formed based on the specified ratios:
   - 1 lemon
   - 2 apples
   - 4 pears
   To find the maximum number of complete sets, it uses the formula:
   ```python
   min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   Here, `b // 2` ensures that there are enough apples for the lemons, and `c // 4` ensures there are enough pears for the lemons. This correctly accounts for the ratios specified in the problem description.

3. **Output Calculation**: The total number of fruits is calculated using:
   ```python
   print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
   ```
   This effectively sums the total number of fruits used in the compote, where `min_lemon` is the number of sets of fruits made. Since each set includes 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, the calculation results in the correct total (1 + 2 + 4 = 7 fruits per set). 

4. **Edge Cases**: The program also correctly handles cases where not enough fruits are available to make even one complete set. If `min_lemon` is zero (which can happen if any of `a`, `b`, or `c` are insufficient), the output will be zero, which is as expected.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem requirements and provides the correct output for all potential cases defined in the problem description.
