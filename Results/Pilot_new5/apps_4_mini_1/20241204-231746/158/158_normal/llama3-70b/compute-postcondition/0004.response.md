The code calculates the output using the variable `min_lemon`, which is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The calculation performed is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, or `min_lemon * 7`. 

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the only variable affected is `min_lemon`, which holds the minimum value as defined.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output is equal to `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output is `min_lemon * 7`.**
