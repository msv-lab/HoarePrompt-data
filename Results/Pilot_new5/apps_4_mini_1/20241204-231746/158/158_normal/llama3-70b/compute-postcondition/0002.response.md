The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated, but since `a` and `b` are still considered as input integers and `c` is now a new integer input, we retain all information about `a` and `b` as input integers. The output state reflects that `c` has been updated to the new integer input value. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
