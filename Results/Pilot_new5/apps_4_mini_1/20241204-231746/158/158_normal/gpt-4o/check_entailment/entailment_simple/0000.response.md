The given program aims to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make a compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the problem description.

1. The program reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.
2. It calculates `max_lemons`, which is determined by the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. The total number of fruits used (`total_fruits`) is then calculated as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons)
   - `max_lemons * 2` (for apples)
   - `max_lemons * 4` (for pears)
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

Now, let's validate the correctness of the program according to the problem description:

- The calculations for `max_lemons` ensure that the program does not exceed the available quantity of any type of fruit while maintaining the required ratio.
- The formula used to calculate `total_fruits` correctly sums the fruits based on the number of lemons used.
- If any type of fruit is insufficient to meet the ratio (for example, if `b < 2` or `c < 4`), `max_lemons` will be calculated as 0, leading to a correct output of 0, which is specified in the problem description for cases where no fruits can be used.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases outlined.

Correctness: **True**
