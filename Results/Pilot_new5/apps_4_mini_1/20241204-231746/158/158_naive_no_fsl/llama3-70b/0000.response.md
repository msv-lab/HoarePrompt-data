Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4.

Here's the reasoning:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed based on the recipe:
   - 1 lemon corresponds to 2 apples and 4 pears.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of complete sets is determined by:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - The number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`).
     - The number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`).
3. The `min` function ensures that we do not exceed the available fruits when determining how many complete sets can be made.
4. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon` (the number of lemon sets) + `min_lemon * 2` (the number of apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (the number of pears).
5. Finally, it prints out this total.

The program handles all edge cases provided in the problem description, including the scenario where not enough fruits are available to create even a single set (resulting in a total of 0). It also correctly computes the output for the given examples in the problem description.

Overall, I cannot find any case where the program would fail to meet the requirements, hence the conclusion that the program is correct.
