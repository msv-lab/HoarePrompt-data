Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the minimum size frame is 1 (i.e., when the white pixels are arranged such that they can only form a frame of size 1). According to the problem description, if a frame can be formed with white pixels, it should be drawn as a frame even if it is 1 pixel wide. 

However, in the function `func_1`, there is a check that requires the frame height and width to be at least 2 (`if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:`). This check will incorrectly return `-1` when a valid 1-pixel frame can actually be formed. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2
ww
ww
```
In this case, the program should output a frame of size 1:
```
ww
ww
```
But according to the current code, it would output `-1`, which violates the problem requirements. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description for at least one possible input case.
