The code creates a list of lists called `pixels`, where each inner list is generated from the input strings taken from the user. The number of inner lists created will be equal to `n`, which represents the number of rows in the grid. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but `pixels` is now populated with input data.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list of lists containing input strings, where the length of `pixels` is equal to `n`.**
