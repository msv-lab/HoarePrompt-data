Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of input containing `m` characters each, which can be either '.' (black pixel) or 'w' (white pixel). It identifies the minimum bounding rectangle that contains all 'w' pixels. If the size of this rectangle exceeds either dimension of the grid, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it updates the border of the rectangle to '+' where there are '.' pixels and then prints the modified grid. The function ensures that at least one 'w' is present in the input, as guaranteed by the problem constraints.**
