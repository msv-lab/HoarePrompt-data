The code `continue` is encountered, which means that the current iteration of the loop will terminate immediately, and the program will move to the next iteration without executing any further code in the loop for this iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the preconditions remain valid since they don't affect those values directly.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0; `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `i` is not equal to `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `j` is not equal to `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.' and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.**
