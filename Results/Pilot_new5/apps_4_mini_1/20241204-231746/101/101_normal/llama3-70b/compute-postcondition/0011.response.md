The values for `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y` will be updated based on the provided code. The code assigns new values to `min_x` and `min_y` using the `min` function, which compares the current values of `min_x`, `min_y` with the new values `x` and `y`. 

The previous values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated as follows:
- `min_x` is updated to the minimum of the previous `min_x` and `x`.
- `min_y` is updated to the minimum of the previous `min_y` and `y`.

No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `min_x` and `min_y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least 3 tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(previous min_y, y)**.
