The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position `pixels[i][j]`. The variable `i` is `0`, and the variable `j` is `1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `j`) are not directly affected by this assignment. The output state reflects that the specific position in the `pixels` matrix has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[0][1]` is '+'**
