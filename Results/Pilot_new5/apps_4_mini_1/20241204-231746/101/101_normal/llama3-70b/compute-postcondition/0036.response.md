The variable `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `+`. The values of `i` and `j` are `0` and `2`, respectively, which indicates that the specific position in the `pixels` array is being updated. The states of the other variables (`n` and `m`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and pixels[0][2] is '+'**.
