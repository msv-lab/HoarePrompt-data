The code snippet `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the specific element in the `pixels` array at the index `[i][j]`. The value of `i` is 0 and `j` is 2 based on the initial state. The dimensions of the `pixels` array are not specified, but it is implicitly assumed to have been defined sufficiently to accommodate these indices.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the `pixels[0][2]` element will be updated to `'.'`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `j`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `pixels[0][2]` is '.'**
