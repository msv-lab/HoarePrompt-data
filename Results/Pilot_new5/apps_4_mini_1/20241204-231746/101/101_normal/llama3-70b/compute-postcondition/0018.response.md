To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided conditions related to the variables before the loop starts. 

1. The variable `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000. This means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. The loop will iterate `n` times, where `i` takes values from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the first iteration.

Based on these observations, for the loop to execute:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which it already is as per the given state).
- `i` needs to be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Since no information suggests altering `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, or `frame_size` is required for the loop execution (as they are not directly influencing the loop's iteration conditions), the necessary adjustments focus solely on `i` and the confirmed state of `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0**
