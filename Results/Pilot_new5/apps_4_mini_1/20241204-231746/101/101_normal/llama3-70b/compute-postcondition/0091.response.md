According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` data structure. Since the loop iterates over `pixels`, for it to execute at least once, `pixels` must contain at least one row. The variables `n` and `m` indicate the size constraints but do not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they describe the bounds rather than the actual contents of `pixels`. 

Given the context, we can infer that `pixels` is expected to be a list or array containing rows of data. Therefore, the essential conditions for the loop to execute are that `pixels` must contain at least one row. 

To summarize the state adjustments:

- `pixels` must have at least one row for the loop to execute.
- Each `row` in the loop will refer to the current row being processed.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must have at least 1 row, `row` is the first row in `pixels**.
