Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[1][1]` is '.', then `pixels[1][1]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `pixels[1][1]` is assigned the value '.'***
