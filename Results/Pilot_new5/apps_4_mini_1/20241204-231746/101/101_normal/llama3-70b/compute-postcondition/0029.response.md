According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that the loop can execute again.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `j` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, which ensures that there is still a valid index in the range for `j`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1.**
