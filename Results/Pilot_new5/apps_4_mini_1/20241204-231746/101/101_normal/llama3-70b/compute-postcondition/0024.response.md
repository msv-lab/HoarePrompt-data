The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `pixels[i][j]` are not altered by this statement, the output state consists of the unchanged variables along with a note that the loop is continuing.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, either `i` is not equal to min_x, `i` is not equal to max_x, `j` is not equal to min_y, `j` is not equal to max_y, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w', and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
