The statement `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the position in the `pixels` array at indices `i` and `j`. The current values of `i` and `j` are 2, so this will specifically update `pixels[2][2]` to be `'+'`. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this particular assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `pixels[2][2]` is '+'**
