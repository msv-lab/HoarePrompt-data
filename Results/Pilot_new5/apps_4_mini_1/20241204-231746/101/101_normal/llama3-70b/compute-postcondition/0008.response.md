The values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated using the new values of `x` and `y`, respectively. The `min` function is used to ensure that `min_x` holds the minimum value between its current value and `x`, and `min_y` holds the minimum value between its current value and `y`. The values of `max_x` and `max_y` remain unchanged. The other variables `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` are also unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least two tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` remains unchanged, `max_y` remains unchanged.**
