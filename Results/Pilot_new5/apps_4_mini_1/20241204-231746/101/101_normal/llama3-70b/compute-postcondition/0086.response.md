The value of `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'.'`. The variable `i` is 2 and `j` is also 2, which means `pixels[2][2]` is being set to `'.'`. Other variables (`n`, `m`) are not affected by this assignment, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `pixels[2][2]` is '.'**
