The program has a number of issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The way the program calculates the size of the frame is incorrect. It computes `frame_size` as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This approach will yield the largest dimension but does not account for the need for a square frame. The problem description requires that the frame be a square; thus, the next step should be to ensure both the height and width are the same and that the minimum frame size encompasses all 'w' pixels.

2. **Frame Placement Logic**: The program sets the pixels to '+' based on the min and max coordinates identified. However, it does not account for existing 'w' pixels appropriately that could affect the frame's positioning or completeness. If a row or column already contains a 'w', it should not be marked as '+', which is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

3. **Output Conditions**: The program outputs `-1` if `frame_size` exceeds either dimension of the grid, but it should also determine if a valid frame can be placed that meets the requirements in cases where 'w' pixels are at the edges or if they form a complete border around the proposed frame (in which case it should output the modified grid). The conditions for when to print `-1` are not adequately defined as per the problem statement.

4. **Multiple Valid Frames**: The program only identifies one possible frame based on the found coordinates. The problem statement allows for the possibility of multiple frames and states any of them is acceptable. The current solution restricts itself to a single output based on the bounding box of 'w' pixels, which may not always yield the correct minimum square frame.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
