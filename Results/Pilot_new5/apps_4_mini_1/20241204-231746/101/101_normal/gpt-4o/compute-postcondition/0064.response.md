Postcondition: ***`top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is None, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `left`, the current state of the program remains unchanged.***
