To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior with respect to the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` and the conditions under which these variables are updated.

- The loop iterates through each row of the `screen` (indicated by `i`) and each column (indicated by `j`).
- The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` variables are initialized to `None`. They are only updated if a white pixel ('w') is found.
- On finding a 'w', `top` and `bottom` are set to the current row index `i`, and `left` and `right` are set to the current column index `j`. If subsequent 'w' characters are found, the respective boundaries are updated based on their positions.

After all iterations, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will represent the outermost boundaries of the 'w' characters present in the entire `screen`. If there are no 'w' characters found, these variables will remain `None`.

Given that the initial state guarantees that at least one 'w' is present in the `screen`, the final values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will represent the minimum and maximum indices of the 'w' characters:

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters; `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns.**
