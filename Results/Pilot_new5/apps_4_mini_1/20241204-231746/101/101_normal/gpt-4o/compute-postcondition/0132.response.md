The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` is 2, both `top` and `bottom` will now be 2. The values of `left`, `right`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**.
