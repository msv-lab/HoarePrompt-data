Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is either 1 or updated to 1 if `j` is greater than its previous value; `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `top` is None, then `right` is set to 1; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
