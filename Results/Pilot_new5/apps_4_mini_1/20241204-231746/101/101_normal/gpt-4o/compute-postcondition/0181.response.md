Postcondition: ***Given that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `j` is equal to `right + 1`, if `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', `result[bottom + 1][right + 1]` is set to '+'.***
