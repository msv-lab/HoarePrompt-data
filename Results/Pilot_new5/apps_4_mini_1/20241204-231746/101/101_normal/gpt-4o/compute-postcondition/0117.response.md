Postcondition: ***`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0. If the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` is set to 2. If `j` is greater than `right` or `j` is less than or equal to `right`, there are no changes to the values.***
