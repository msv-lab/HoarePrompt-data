Postcondition: ***`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the condition holds true and the program continues. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the condition does not hold true, and no further action is taken, leaving the values unchanged.***
