Postcondition: ***`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is less than `top`. If `j` is less than `left`, `j` is incremented by 1, preserving all other conditions stated in the precondition.***
