The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `left` is equal to `j`, so after the assignment, `left` remains equal to `j`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'; `left` is equal to `j`.**
