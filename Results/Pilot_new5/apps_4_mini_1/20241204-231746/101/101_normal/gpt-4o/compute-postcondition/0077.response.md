The code `left = j` assigns the current value of `j` to `left`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions state that `left` is equal to `j`, so after the assignment, the values are still the same. 

Output State: **`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is less than `top`.**
