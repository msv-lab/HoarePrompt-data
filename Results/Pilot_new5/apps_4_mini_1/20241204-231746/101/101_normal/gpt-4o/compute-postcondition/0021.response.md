Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left` are either 0 or remain unchanged, `right` is either 0 or None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` is set to 0; otherwise, the state remains unchanged with respect to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `m`, and `j`.***
