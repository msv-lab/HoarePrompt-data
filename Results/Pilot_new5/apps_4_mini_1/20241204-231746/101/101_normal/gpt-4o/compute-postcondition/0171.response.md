According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `top` and `bottom`. The loop will execute while `i` is within the range from `top` to `bottom` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to either `top` or `bottom`, and `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. 

If `i` is currently equal to `bottom`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` would become `bottom + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, it means `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom + 1`. 

If `i` is equal to `top`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would become `top + 1`, and `top` must still be less than or equal to `bottom`.

In summary:
- If `i` is equal to `bottom`, then `i` will be adjusted to `bottom + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute again requires `top` to be less than or equal to `bottom + 1`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and all elements `result[i][j]` for `j` in the range from `left` to `right` that were originally '.' would remain updated to '+'**.
