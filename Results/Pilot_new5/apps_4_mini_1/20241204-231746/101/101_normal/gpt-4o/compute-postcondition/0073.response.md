The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since `top` was either 1 or equal to `i`, and now it is explicitly set to 1, the value remains consistent. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
