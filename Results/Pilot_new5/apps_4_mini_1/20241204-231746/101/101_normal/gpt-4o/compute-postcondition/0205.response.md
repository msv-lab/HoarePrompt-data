The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers, and `screen`, which is a list of strings. The integers `n` and `m` are constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The `screen` list contains strings of length `m`, consisting of '.' for black pixels and 'w' for white pixels, with at least one 'w' present in the screen.

After executing the function body:

- Case_1: If there is no valid index for the 'w' characters because at least one of the indices (top, bottom, left, right) is None, the function returns -1.
- Case_2: If `frame_height` is less than 2 or `frame_width` is less than 2, the function returns -1.
- Case_3: If the above cases are not met, the function returns the updated `result` matrix where the boundary defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' has been modified with '+' in place of '.'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, and return either -1 if certain conditions are not met, or an updated matrix that modifies the boundaries around the 'w' characters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (both integers) and a list of strings screen. It returns -1 if no valid index for 'w' characters is found or if frame dimensions are invalid; otherwise, it returns the updated matrix with boundaries modified.**
