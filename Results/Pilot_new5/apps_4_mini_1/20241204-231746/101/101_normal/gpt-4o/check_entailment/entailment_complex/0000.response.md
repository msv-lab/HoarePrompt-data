Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description, particularly the frame size and conditions around it. Here are the key issues:

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program checks if the `frame_height` and `frame_width` are both less than 2 to return -1. However, the frame can be valid and have a height or width of 1 if all 'w' pixels are found on the edge of a 1x1 square (which is a valid frame). The problem description allows for frames of size 1 pixel, which the current implementation does not account for.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The function should allow for the case where the 'w' pixels form a small frame that can technically be considered valid. For example, if there are 'w' pixels at the corners of a grid, a frame can be formed around them even if the height or width is 1.

3. **Output Formatting**: The function outputs the entire screen, but according to the problem description, it must print the frame in a specific format. If a valid minimum frame does not exist, it must return -1, but this is not handled correctly.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The current program does not consider cases where the smallest frame could be valid but has not been detected due to the constraints on height and width. A correct implementation should be able to find frames of size that includes touching the edges of the grid or just being a single pixel frame.

In summary, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, specifically regarding the frame size and its proper identification, which is necessary for determining the correctness of the output.
