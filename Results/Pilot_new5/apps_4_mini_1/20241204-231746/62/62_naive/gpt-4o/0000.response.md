Correctness: **True**.

The provided program takes two numbers represented in different bases and correctly converts them to decimal before comparing them. The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the decimal representation of a number based on its digits and base. The comparisons between the two decimal values are straightforward and directly correspond to the problem description.

The program handles various scenarios, including different base representations and correctly identifies the relationship between the two numbers (less than, greater than, or equal to). Since all edge cases appear to be covered and the conversion logic is correct, I believe the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
