The variable `result` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `digits` and `base`, remain unaffected in this execution step as they are not modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, `base` is an integer representing the base, and `result` is 0.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, `base` is an integer representing the base, and `result` is 0**.
