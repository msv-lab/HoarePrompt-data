To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop provided:

Initial State: `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, `base` is an integer representing the base, and `result` is 0.

The loop operates as follows:
```
for digit in digits:
    result = result * base + digit
```

1. During the first iteration, `result` becomes `0 * base + first digit`, which is equal to the first digit.
2. In the second iteration, `result` becomes `(first digit * base) + second digit`.
3. This pattern continues, effectively calculating the base-n representation of the number formed by the digits.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will hold the value of the number represented in the specified base formed by the digits in the list. The number of iterations corresponds to the length of the `digits` list.

If the `digits` list contains `k` digits, then after executing the loop `k` times, the output will reflect the final computed value of `result` as it accumulates the contributions of each digit, shifted appropriately by the base.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, `base` is an integer, `result` is the integer represented by `digits` in base `base`.**
