According to the code, the loop iterates over the `digits` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 3 digits. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the second digit in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `digit` would need to be updated to the third digit in the list.

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `digits` must have at least 3 digits, `digit` should be the third digit in the list, and `base` and `result` remain unchanged as they are not directly impacted by the iteration count in this context.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list, `base` is an integer, `result` is equal to `digit * base + digit`.**
