According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one digit, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is initialized to 0. For the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and `digit` would be set to the first digit in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `base` is an integer, `result` is 0**
