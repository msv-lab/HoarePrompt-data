Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's why it meets all the specified requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the first two lines of input correctly, extracting the number of digits and the base for the first number (X), and then the digits themselves. It does the same for the second number (Y). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base, then calculates the equivalent integer value in decimal form. This is done using the standard method of converting from any base to decimal by accumulating the value using `result = result * base + digit`. This correctly translates the digits from the specified base to a base-10 integer.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both X and Y to their decimal equivalents, the program compares the two integers using standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`). This comparison directly reflects the required output as specified in the problem description.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the result of the comparison as one of the characters '<', '>', or '=', which matches the expected output format.

5. **Constraints Handling**: The constraints specified in the problem description (like the range of bases and the digits being non-negative and less than their respective bases) are inherently respected by the logic of the program and the input guarantees.

Overall, the program executes the steps necessary to read the input, convert the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, compare those decimal numbers, and print the correct relational symbol as required by the problem description. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
