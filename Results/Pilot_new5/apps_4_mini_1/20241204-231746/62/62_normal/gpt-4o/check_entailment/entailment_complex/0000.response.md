Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the assumption within the `func_1` function. While the function is designed to convert a number represented by a list of digits in a specified base to its decimal equivalent, it lacks validation to ensure that each digit is indeed valid for the given base. 

For example, if the input contains digits that are not less than the specified base (e.g., if the base is 3 and one of the digits is 3), the program would still attempt to calculate the decimal value, leading to incorrect results. The problem description clearly states that the input will have valid digits (0 â‰¤ digit < base), but the program does not enforce this validation, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect comparisons.

Additionally, there could be edge cases where the function does not return the expected values due to invalid input configuration. Without the necessary checks, the calculations may yield erroneous results, causing incorrect comparisons between X and Y.

Thus, the failure to include input validation for the digits means that the program does not conform to the problem requirements in all potential input cases.
