The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. The parameter `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the specified `base`, where the number of digits is between 1 and 10, and each digit is a non-negative integer less than `base`. The parameter `base` is an integer which must be between 2 and 40. The function calculates the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` with respect to the provided `base` and returns this value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number in a specified base and an integer `base`, and it returns the decimal representation of the number formed by those digits in the given base.**
