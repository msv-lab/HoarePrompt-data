The value of `decimal_value` is updated by multiplying it with `base` and adding `digit`. Since `decimal_value` is initially equal to `digit` and `digit` is the second element in the `digits` list, the new value of `decimal_value` will be `digit * base + digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`digits` must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * base + digit`, `digit` is the second element in the `digits` list**.
