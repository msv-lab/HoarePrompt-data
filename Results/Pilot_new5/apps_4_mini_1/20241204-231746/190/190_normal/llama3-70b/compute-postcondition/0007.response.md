The value of `min_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is equal to `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.**
