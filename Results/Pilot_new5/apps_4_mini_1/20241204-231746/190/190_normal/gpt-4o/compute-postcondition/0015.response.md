To determine the impact of the provided code on the variables and their values, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, and `length` is the second element of `a`.

The code snippet is:
```
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Here, `current_cost` is being updated by adding the result of the expression `t - 1 - length` to its current value. 

1. The variable `current_cost` is affected directly as its value changes.
2. The variables `t` and `length` are also involved in the expression that computes the new value for `current_cost`. 
3. `length` retains its value as the second element of the list `a`, which is an integer.

Other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Since we donâ€™t have specific values for `current_cost`, `t`, or `length`, we can only express the change generically.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `length` is the second element of `a`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`**.
