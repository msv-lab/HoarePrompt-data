The expression `current_cost += t - 1 - length` modifies the value of `current_cost`. The new value of `current_cost` will be the old value of `current_cost` plus the result of the expression `t - 1 - length`. The variables `t` and `length` are also involved, where `length` is defined as the third element of the list `a`, which must be 2 or greater.

Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `length` (i.e., `a[2]`) must be 2 or greater, we can summarize the changes:

- `current_cost` is updated based on the new calculation.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `length` remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `length` is the third element of `a`, which is 2 or greater; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`.**
