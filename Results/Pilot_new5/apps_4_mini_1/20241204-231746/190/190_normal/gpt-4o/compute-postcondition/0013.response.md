Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, and `length` is the first element of `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` increases by the value of `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and specifically if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` increases by `length - (t + 1)`.***
