Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `length` is the first element of `a`. If `length` is less than 100, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (100 - length)` while `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `length` is greater than or equal to 100, and if `length` is greater than 102, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `t` is 101. If `length` is less than or equal to 102, the values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, `current_cost`, and `t` remain unchanged.***
