Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total adjustment made based on each element of `a` compared to `t`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If all integers in `a` are within the range [1,3], `current_cost` remains 0.**
