The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)`. The variable `length` is the second element of the list `a`, and `t` is unchanged in this context. The previous states of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged, but `current_cost` is modified as per the operation. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the second element of `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, and `t` is unchanged.**
