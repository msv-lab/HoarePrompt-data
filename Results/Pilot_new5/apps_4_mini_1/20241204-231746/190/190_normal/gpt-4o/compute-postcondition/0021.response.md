The variable `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`. The value of `length` is equal to the third element of the list `a`, and `t` is an unknown integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, it does not directly affect the calculation of `current_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `length` is the third element of `a`, and `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `length` is the third element of `a`, `current_cost` is updated by `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`**.
