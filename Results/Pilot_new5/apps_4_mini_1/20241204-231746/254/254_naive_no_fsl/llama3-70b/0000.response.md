Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if it's possible to light up the garlands continuously by checking if the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals is divisible by each of the garland intervals. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that there's continuous coverage without gaps.

Consider the input case:
```
1 2 3
```

In this scenario:
1. If we set `x_1 = 1` for the first garland (interval 1), it will be lit at all seconds.
2. If we set `x_2 = 2` for the second garland (interval 2), it will be lit at every even second.
3. If we set `x_3 = 3` for the third garland (interval 3), it will be lit at seconds 3, 6, 9, etc.

Even though the LCM checks may pass, it does not account for the fact that there can be seconds where no garland is lit. For instance, if `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` have values such that they do not cover every second after a certain point (e.g. 4), there would be a moment with no lit garland.

Therefore, the logic fails to ensure that at least one garland is lit for every second after the maximum switch-on time. Thus, it doesn't satisfy the problem requirements completely.
