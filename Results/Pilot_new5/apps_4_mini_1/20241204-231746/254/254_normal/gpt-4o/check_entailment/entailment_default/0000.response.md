To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to examine the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Summary
Mishka has three garlands that can be turned on at different times. Each garland has a time interval after which it lights up again. The goal is to determine if there exists a combination of start times (for each garland) such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of those start times.

### Initial Observations
The program calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the three intervals. If the GCD is 1, it prints "YES", meaning the intervals are coprime and can cover all seconds. If the GCD is greater than 1, it prints "NO", meaning there will be seconds when no garland is lit.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **All intervals are the same**: If `k1 = k2 = k3`, then the GCD will be the value of these intervals, which is greater than 1, resulting in a "NO". However, if the intervals are the same and greater than 1, there will be seconds when no garland is lit.

2. **Intervals that are not coprime**: If, for example, the intervals are `2, 4, 6`, the GCD is 2, and there will indeed be seconds (like all odd seconds) where no garland is lit.

3. **Minimum values**: The smallest allowed intervals are 1, 1, and 1. The GCD is 1, and thus it should output "YES", which is correct.

4. **Mix of values**: If `k1 = 1`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, the GCD is 1, leading to a "YES", which seems correct because at least one garland will light every second.

### Output Hints Assessment
The output hints state that the program checks if the intervals are coprime. This aligns with the logic in the code. It confirms that if the GCD is 1, the garlands can be timed such that at least one is lit at all times. If the GCD is greater than 1, there will be gaps in the lighting, which is also correctly captured.

### Conclusion
Upon evaluating the code against the problem description and considering edge cases, the program appears to correctly determine whether it is possible to keep at least one garland lit continuously. There are no potential cases found where the program would fail to meet the description's requirements.

Thus, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
