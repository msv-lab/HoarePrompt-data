Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the garland intervals `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` to determine if it is possible to have at least one garland lit at all times after the maximum of `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_3`. However, the use of GCD is incorrect in this context.

The problem states that Mishka needs to select times `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_3` such that for every second after `max(x_1, x_2, x_3)`, at least one garland should be lit. The condition for this is not based on the GCD of the intervals but rather on whether the intervals can be adjusted such that their lit times together cover every second after a certain point.

In fact, if the GCD of all three intervals is greater than 1, it indicates that there are certain seconds where none of the garlands would be lit. Therefore, the program incorrectly checks for the GCD equating to 1 as a condition for outputting "YES". The correct condition would involve checking if it's possible to cover every second after a chosen maximum time, which may not be satisfied simply by the GCD being 1.

For instance, with the input `4 2 3`, as given in the problem description, the GCD is 1, but there are still moments when none of the garlands would be lit. This demonstrates that the program fails to account for all cases regarding the covering of seconds, particularly when there are overlaps or gaps in the lit times of the garlands.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
