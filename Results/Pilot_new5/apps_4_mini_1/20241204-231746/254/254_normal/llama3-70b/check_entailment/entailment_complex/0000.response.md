The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that every second after the maximum of the chosen times, at least one garland is lit.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to ensure that starting from a certain time, at least one garland is lit at every second.
   - This can be assured if the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) can be achieved. If the LCM is divisible by \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \), it means there are times when each garland is lit, covering the required intervals.

2. **Code Logic**:
   - The program calculates the LCM using the formula involving the greatest common divisor (GCD): 
     \[
     \text{lcm}(k1, k2, k3) = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)}
     \]
   - Then, it checks if this LCM is divisible by \( k1, k2, \) and \( k3 \). If it is, it prints "YES", else "NO".

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating LCM and checking divisibility aligns with ensuring that the coverage of the garlands at every second is achieved.
   - The program correctly identifies cases where it is possible to cover every second after the maximum of the chosen times (i.e., starting from the maximum time chosen for the garlands).

### Counter-Example Check:
- The program can be tested with edge cases, such as:
  - \( k1 = 1, k2 = 1, k3 = 1 \) → Should return "YES".
  - \( k1 = 1, k2 = 2, k3 = 3 \) → Should return "YES".
  - \( k1 = 4, k2 = 2, k3 = 3 \) → Should return "NO".

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly computes whether it is possible for the garlands to cover all seconds with at least one garland lit based on the LCM of their intervals, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
