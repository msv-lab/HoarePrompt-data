#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the time intervals of the three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is a positive integer
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since there is no check for cases where both `a` and `b` are zero (which is not applicable here given the constraints), the function is safe from such edge cases and operates correctly within the bounds of the provided input limits.
