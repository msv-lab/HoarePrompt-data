According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (i.e., true), the loop will execute. Right before the loop, `b` is a positive integer, meaning it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `b` is positive, it is already sufficient for the loop to run.

State: **a, b, and c are positive integers representing the time intervals of the three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500**
