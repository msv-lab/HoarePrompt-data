The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing the current vertex.
- `graph` is a list of tuples representing directed edges.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited.
- `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating the vertices currently in the recursion stack.

After executing the function body, the function can return values based on the following cases:

- Case 1: The function returns `True`, indicating that the node has been successfully processed with its neighbor and is part of a valid exploration in the graph.
- Case 2: The function returns `True`, indicating that there is a cycle involving the 'neighbor' node in the graph as both `visited[neighbor]` and `rec_stack[neighbor]` are `True`.
- Case 3: The function returns `True`, indicating that the current node has been successfully visited and is part of the recursion stack in the graph traversal.
- Case 4: The function returns `True`, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph or has been successfully visited.
- Case 5: The function returns `True`, indicating that the node has been visited and is currently in the recursion stack, confirming its presence in the graph's traversal.
- Case 6: The function returns `True`, indicating that 'node' is currently being processed and it has at least one neighbor in the 'graph' that has been visited.
- Case 7: The function returns `False`, indicating that there is no cycle detected in the graph for the given node.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a list of directed edges `graph`, and two lists of boolean values `visited` and `rec_stack`, and it returns `True` or `False` based on the processing of the node in the context of cycle detection in a directed graph. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node (integer), graph (list of tuples), visited (list of boolean values), and rec_stack (list of boolean values), and returns True for various cases indicating successful processing, cycle detection, or presence in recursion, or returns False if no cycle is detected for the given node.**
