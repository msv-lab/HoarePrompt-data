Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer and `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the program returns True, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph or has been successfully visited. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, no result is returned.***
