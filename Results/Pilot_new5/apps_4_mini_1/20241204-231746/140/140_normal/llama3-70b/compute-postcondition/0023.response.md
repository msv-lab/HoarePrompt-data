Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that the neighbor has been visited and is currently in the recursion stack. Otherwise, if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that `node` is currently being processed and has at least one neighbor in the `graph` that has been visited.***
