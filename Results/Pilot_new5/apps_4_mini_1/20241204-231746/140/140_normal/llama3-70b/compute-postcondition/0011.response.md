Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `visited[neighbor]` was False and the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` did not return True, then the state remains unchanged with `visited[neighbor]` still False. Otherwise, if `visited[neighbor]` was True, it indicates that `neighbor` has already been visited and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False.***
