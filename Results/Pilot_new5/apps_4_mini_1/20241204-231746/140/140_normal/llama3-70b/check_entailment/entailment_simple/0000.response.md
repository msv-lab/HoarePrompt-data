Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. The main issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if there is a cycle in the directed graph and simply prints "NO" if it finds one, or "YES" if it does not. 

However, the problem requires determining if we can make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The current program does not check for this condition. It fails to consider that there could be cases where one edge removal is sufficient to break a cycle, even if a cycle exists.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
This graph forms a cycle (1 → 2 → 3 → 1). The correct response should be "YES" because removing any one of the three edges would break the cycle, yet the current implementation would simply check for cycles and output "NO".

To properly solve the problem, the program must:
1. Detect cycles in the original graph.
2. Check if there exists an edge whose removal would break that cycle, allowing the graph to become acyclic.

Since the current implementation does not fulfill these requirements, it does not meet the problem description's criteria. Thus, the correctness is determined to be false.
