According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys of the `graph` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `graph` must contain at least one vertex (key). The state of `n` does not directly impact the loop execution, but it indicates the number of vertices that should correspond to the keys in `graph`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `u` will be the last key in the `graph`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `graph` has at least one vertex and `u` is the first vertex in the graph on the first iteration.

State: **`graph` must have at least 1 key, `n` must be greater than 0, `u` is the first key in the graph**
