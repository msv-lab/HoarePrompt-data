Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all reachable vertices from the original nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating that all vertices with in-degrees of 0 have been processed; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `count` reflects the total number of vertices that have been processed from `queue`.**
