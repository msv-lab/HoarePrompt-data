To determine whether the `while queue:` loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `queue`. The loop will only proceed if `queue` contains at least one element, meaning there must be at least one vertex in the graph with an in-degree of 0.

Currently, `queue` is either empty or contains vertices with in-degrees of 0. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `queue` contains one or more vertices.

Since `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices and `n` is the total number of vertices, if `queue` is empty, it indicates that there are no vertices with an in-degree of 0. Thus, at least one vertex with an in-degree of 0 must exist for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the current `queue` is not empty, meaning that there must be at least one vertex with an in-degree of 0.

State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, `n` is the total number of vertices, and `queue` must contain at least one vertex with an in-degree of 0**.
