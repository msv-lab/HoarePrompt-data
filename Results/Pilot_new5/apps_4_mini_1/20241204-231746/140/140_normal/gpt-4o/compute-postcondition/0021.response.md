The value of `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1. The previous state indicates that `in_degree[v]` had some initial value, but we do not know what that value is. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original conditions. Therefore, the Output State incorporates the change in `in_degree[v]`.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 keys, `n` is greater than 0, `u` is the third key in `graph`, `graph[u]` must have at least 2 values, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1.**
