The value of `node` is assigned the first element from `queue` after it is removed using `popleft()`. The other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all neighbors of `node`; `queue` has one less element; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` is now the first element that was in `queue` prior to the operation; `count` reflects the total number of neighbors processed.
