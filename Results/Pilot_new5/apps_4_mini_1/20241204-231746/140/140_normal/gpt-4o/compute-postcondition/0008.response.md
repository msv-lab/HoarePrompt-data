Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 key, `n` is greater than 0, `u` is the first key in `graph`, `graph[u]` has `k` values, where `k` is the number of values associated with key `u`, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1 for each `v` in `graph[u]`, and `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of vertices associated with the values in `graph[u]`.**
