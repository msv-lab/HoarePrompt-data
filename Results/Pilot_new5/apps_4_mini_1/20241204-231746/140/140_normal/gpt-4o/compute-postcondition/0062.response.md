According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` includes all neighbors of `node` that had an in-degree of 0 after processing. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `queue` must still contain at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all neighbors of `node`; `queue` must include at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` is the last element processed from the neighbors of the first node popped from `queue`; `count` reflects the total number of neighbors processed.**
