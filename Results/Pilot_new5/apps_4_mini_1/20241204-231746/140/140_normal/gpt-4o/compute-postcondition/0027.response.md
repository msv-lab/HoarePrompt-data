The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables `in_degree`, `n`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph; `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing the vertices from `in_degree` that have an in-degree of 0 or is empty if no such vertices exist; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph; `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing the vertices from `in_degree` that have an in-degree of 0 or is empty if no such vertices exist; `count` is 0.**
