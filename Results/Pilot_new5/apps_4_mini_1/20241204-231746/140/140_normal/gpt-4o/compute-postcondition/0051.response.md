The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Since `in_degree[neighbor]` has been updated to 0, it indicates that `neighbor` is now ready to be processed (i.e., it has no incoming edges). The other variables remain unchanged, but we note that `neighbor` is now part of the `queue`. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees, `queue` now includes `neighbor`, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` is the first element popped from `queue`, `count` is incremented by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
