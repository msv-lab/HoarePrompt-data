The `queue` will have the `neighbor` vertex appended to it. The values of `in_degree`, `n`, and `node` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1; `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor` appended to it; `n` remains unchanged; `node` is a valid vertex in the graph; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1; `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor` appended to it; `n` remains unchanged; `node` is a valid vertex in the graph; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.**
