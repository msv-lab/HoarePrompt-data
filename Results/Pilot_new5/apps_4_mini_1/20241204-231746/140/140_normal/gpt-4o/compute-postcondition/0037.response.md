The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. Since `neighbor` is a valid vertex in the graph and `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices, the output state indicates that the in-degree of this specific neighbor has decreased by 1. The states of `queue`, `n`, and `node` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor`, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in the graph with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`.**
