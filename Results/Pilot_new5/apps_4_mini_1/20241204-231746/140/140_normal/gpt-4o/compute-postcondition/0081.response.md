The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (ranging from 1 to n), and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from those vertices. Additionally, the function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of vertices in the graph, with the condition that `n` is at least 2. After executing the function body, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of vertices processed from the queue is not equal to the total number of vertices, which signifies whether there is a cycle in the graph. Therefore, the functionality of the function `has_cycle` is to accept a dictionary representing a directed graph and return a boolean indicating the presence of a cycle based on the processing of the vertices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph (a dictionary of vertices and edges) and returns a boolean indicating whether there is a cycle in the graph based on the processing of the vertices.**
