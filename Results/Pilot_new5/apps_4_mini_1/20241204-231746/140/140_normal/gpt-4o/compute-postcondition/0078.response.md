Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` that have an in-degree of 0 after processing all neighbors, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` contains all its neighbors, and all neighbors of `node` that had their in-degree decreased to 0 have been added to `queue`.**
