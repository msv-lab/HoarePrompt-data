The code creates a queue that contains all vertices from `in_degree` that have an in-degree of 0. Since `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices, if a vertex has an in-degree of 0, it means it has no incoming edges and is ready to be processed. The state of `n` (the total number of vertices) is not directly affected by this code. 

If the graph is empty, `in_degree` will have no keys, resulting in an empty queue. If there are vertices with an in-degree of 0, the queue will contain those vertex identifiers.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph; `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing the vertices from `in_degree` that have an in-degree of 0 or is empty if no such vertices exist.**
