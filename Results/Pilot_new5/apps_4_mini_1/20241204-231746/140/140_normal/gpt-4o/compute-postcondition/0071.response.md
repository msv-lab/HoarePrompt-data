The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of `in_degree[neighbor]` changes based on its previous value. The value of `in_degree` may vary depending on the structure of the graph, but the precondition that `graph[node]` contains at least 2 neighbors ensures that `neighbor` is a valid index.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` has one additional element `neighbor`, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors, `in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to its previous value minus 1.**
