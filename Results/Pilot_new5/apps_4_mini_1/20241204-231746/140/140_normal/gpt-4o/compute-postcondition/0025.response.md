Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, where each value corresponds to the number of incoming edges for each vertex, and `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph. If the graph is empty (i.e., has no keys), the `in_degree` will remain as initialized, with each vertex having an in-degree of 0.**
