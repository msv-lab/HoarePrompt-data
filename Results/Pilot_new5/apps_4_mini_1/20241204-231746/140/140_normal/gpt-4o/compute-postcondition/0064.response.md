The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all neighbors of `node`; `queue` has one less element; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` is the first element that was in `queue` prior to the operation; `count` is incremented by 1.
