The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list of tuples `edges` that represent the directed edges in a graph. It constructs a directed graph and checks for cycles. If the graph is acyclic at the initial state or after removing any single edge, it returns 'YES'. If all checks indicate that the graph contains at least one cycle, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not handle the case where `edges` is empty or when `m` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it assumes valid input according to the constraints provided.
