The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b ^ x`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The previous values of `s` and `x` are not directly affected by this operation, but `x` is a non-negative integer, and `b` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot assign a specific value to `a` without knowing `b`. The output state will include the conditions on `s`, `x`, and an expression for `a` based on `b` and `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12; `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12; `a` is equal to `b ^ x`.**
