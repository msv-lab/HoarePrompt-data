Postcondition: ***`s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is equal to `s - 1` if `x` is equal to the result of `1 XOR (s - 1)`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 with `a` as 1 and `b` equal to `s - 1.***
