According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to execute `i` times, starting from 0 up to `i-1`. Given that `i` is the final index + 1, it needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all. Since `n` is greater than 1, it indicates a valid state, but we must ensure that `i` is adjusted correctly to execute the loop.

Before the loop starts, since `i` is already the final index + 1, it suggests that `i` must be at least 1. Thus, `j` will start from 0 and go to `i-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized at 0. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `j` is 0**
