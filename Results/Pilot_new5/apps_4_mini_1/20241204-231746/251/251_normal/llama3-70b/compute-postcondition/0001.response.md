The variable `cakes` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as the assignment does not affect it. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` is an empty list.**
