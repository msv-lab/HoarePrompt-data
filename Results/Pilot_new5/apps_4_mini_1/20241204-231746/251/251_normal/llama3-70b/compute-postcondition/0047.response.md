According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` remains unchanged. The values for `cakes` and `dp` are also not required to change for the next iteration since the loop will only iterate further while `j` updates.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is equal to max(`cakes[n][0]`, `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`), and `dp[i]` remains unchanged for other indices.**
