According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` is 1 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Since `j` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute, `i` must remain greater than `j`, which means `i` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 2**
