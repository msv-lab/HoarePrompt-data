The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value `dp[i]` and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and `j` is 2. The value of `dp[j]` is `dp[2]` and `cakes[i][0]` is `cakes[2][0]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[2][0]), `j` is 2, `dp[2]` is equal to max(dp[2], dp[2] + cakes[2][0])**
