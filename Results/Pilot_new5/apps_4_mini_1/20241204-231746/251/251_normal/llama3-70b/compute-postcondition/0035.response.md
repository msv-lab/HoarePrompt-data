The code updates the value of `dp[i]` by taking the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. The condition states that `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, which is valid but does not affect the output state directly. The previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are used to calculate the new value for `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is equal to max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0]) where cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]**
