According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be 1. Since `i` is the final index + 1, and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than 1. 

Given that `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `j`, it becomes 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be 1, and `j` can take values up to `i - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j]` plus `cakes[i][0]`, with `cakes[i][1]` being less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` being less than `cakes[j][2]`.**
