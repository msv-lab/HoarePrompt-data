The statement `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` assigns the value of `cakes[i][0]` to `dp[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, `dp[n]` will be updated to the value of `cakes[n][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`, and `dp[i]` remains unchanged for other indices.**
