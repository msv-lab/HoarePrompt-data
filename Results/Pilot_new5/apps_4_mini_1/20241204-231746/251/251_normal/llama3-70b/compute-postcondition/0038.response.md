The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index plus 1, and `j` is 2. Since the specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `cakes[i][0]` are not provided, we can only express the changes in terms of the variables.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[2] + cakes[i][0])**.
