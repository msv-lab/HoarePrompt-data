Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, while `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]` remain unchanged. The index `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i + 1]` holds if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, with the requirement that `i` is at least 2.***
