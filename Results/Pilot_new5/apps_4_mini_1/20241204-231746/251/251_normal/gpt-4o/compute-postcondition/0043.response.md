The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum sum of volumes formed by considering the volumes of cakes up to index `i`, represented by the maximum value in the list `dp`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, and return the maximum sum of volumes of cakes based on their dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes, and returns the maximum sum of volumes formed by considering the volumes of cakes up to index i.**
