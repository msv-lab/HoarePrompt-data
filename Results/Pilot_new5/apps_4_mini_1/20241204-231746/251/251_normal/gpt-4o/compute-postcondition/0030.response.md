To determine the required states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure:

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `i`. This means that for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1, because the range function `range(i)` produces a sequence starting from 0 up to, but not including, `i`. Given that it has been provided that `i` is at least 2, the loop will execute.

2. The loop index `j` will take values from 0 to `i - 1`. Therefore, `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

3. The current state before the loop states that `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, and we have `volumes` as a list of volumes. The integrity and correctness of this must be maintained, but it does not directly impact the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop execution are as follows:

- `i` must be at least 1 (which it is, since it's at least 2).
- `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Thus, we can summarize the conditions necessary for the loop to execute:

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 2, `volumes` is a list of volumes, `j` is 0**
