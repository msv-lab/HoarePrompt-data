Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is either equal to `volumes[i]` or updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])`. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[2] + volumes[i])`. If `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. `n` remains a positive integer, `i` remains at least 2, and `j` is 2.***
