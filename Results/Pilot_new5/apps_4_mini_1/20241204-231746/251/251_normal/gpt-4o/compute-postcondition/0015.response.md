According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i]` is the maximum sum of volumes for the first `i` indices. Since the loop is designed to run from 0 to `n-1`, for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Currently, `i` is less than `n`, thus allowing for one more execution of the loop. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer, we can conclude that the next state will have `i` increased by 1, which will be `i + 1`.

State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum sum of volumes for the first `i` indices, `n` is a positive integer, and for the next iteration `i` is `i + 1`.**
