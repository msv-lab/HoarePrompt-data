According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for `j` ranging from 0 to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, and `n` is a positive integer. 

Since `i` is being incremented for the next iteration, it indicates that `i` is currently set to a value that is one less than what will be used in the loop. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1 to allow the loop to execute. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are: `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` starts from 0.

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` starts at 0**
