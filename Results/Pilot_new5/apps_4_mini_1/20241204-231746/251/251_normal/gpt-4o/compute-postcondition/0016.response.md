The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The initial state indicates that `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of volumes for the first `i` indices, but after executing the code, `dp[i]` now holds the volume at the current index `i`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, for the next iteration `i` is `i + 1`.**
