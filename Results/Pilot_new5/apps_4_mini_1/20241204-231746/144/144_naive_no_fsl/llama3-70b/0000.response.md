Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the maximum possible value of mex after applying the operations as described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the input array, which allows it to process the numbers in ascending order. This is important because mex is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the array, and processing in order helps to keep track of the smallest missing number efficiently.

2. **Finding the Mex**: The code initializes `mex` to 1 (the smallest positive integer). It iterates through the sorted array, checking if the current number in the array is equal to `mex`. 
   - If it finds that `num` equals `mex`, it increments `mex` because that number is present in the array.
   - If it encounters a number greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop early because any subsequent numbers will also be greater, and thus, `mex` cannot be formed by those.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles the simplest input correctly (for example, if the array consists of a single number like 1, the output will be 2). It also considers the case where the array has all numbers greater than `n`, as demonstrated in the examples where the maximum mex can be `n + 1`.

4. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently handles the constraints given, as it mainly consists of a sort operation followed by a single pass through the array, leading to a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operation.

Overall, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description and correctly computes the maximum possible value of mex for all valid input cases as shown in the examples provided.
