Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates and prints the smallest positive integer (mex) that is not present in the list. If all integers from 1 to `n` are present, it will print `n + 1` as the smallest missing positive integer. The function does not consider cases where the list is empty or contains non-positive integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `n` is not specified correctly in the input. **
