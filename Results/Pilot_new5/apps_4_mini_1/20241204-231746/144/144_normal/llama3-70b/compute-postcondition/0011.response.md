Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 1 element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; and `mex` is either 2 if `num` equals 1 or remains 1 if `num` is not equal to `mex`. If `num` is 2, `mex` is updated to 2. If `num` is greater than `mex`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
