According to the code, the loop iterates through each element in the `arr`, which is a sorted list of positive integers. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element of `arr`. 

Since `arr` has at least one element, if the loop is to execute one more time, `num` will take on the value of the next element in the `arr`. If `arr` contains `n` elements, this means that for the loop to execute one more time, the current `num` must be the last element of the array for it to increment to the next index.

Given that `mex` is updated to 2 if `num` is equal to 1, and remains 1 otherwise, we need to account for the transition of `num` into the next element of the sorted list. 

Thus, the next `num` would be `arr[1]`, and depending on its value, `mex` may or may not change. Since `arr` is sorted and contains only positive integers, we can conclude:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; and `mex` must be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `num`.**
