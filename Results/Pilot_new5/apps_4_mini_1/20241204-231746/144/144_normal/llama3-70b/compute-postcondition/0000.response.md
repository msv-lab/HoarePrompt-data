The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000. The states of the other variables, such as the list `a`, are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
