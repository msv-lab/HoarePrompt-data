To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the code.

### Problem Description:
Alyona wants to modify an array of positive integers such that for any element `a_i` in the array, it may be decreased to any positive integer less than `a_i`. The goal is to determine the maximum possible value of the mex of the resulting array. The mex of an array is defined as the smallest positive integer that is not present in that array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
    print(mex)
```

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:** The function reads an integer `n` and an array of integers `arr`. 
2. **Array Sorting:** The array is sorted, which is crucial for finding the mex efficiently.
3. **Mex Calculation:** The variable `mex` is initialized to `1`. The loop iterates through the sorted array:
   - If the current number equals `mex`, it means `mex` can be incremented because the number is present in the array.
   - If the current number is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, and `mex` remains unchanged, which is correct because that means the mex can't be found in the array.
4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The function handles the case where the list contains only 1s, correctly returning 2 (the mex).
- It also handles the case where all integers from 1 to `n` are present and returns `n + 1`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function will print the smallest positive integer not present in the list. It also mentions that if all integers from 1 to `n` are present, it will print `n + 1`. 

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints accurately describe the behavior of the code:
- The function will indeed return the correct mex for any valid array input based on the logic explained.
- There are no contradictions between the hints and the code.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description accurately and handles edge cases appropriately. There are no examples where it fails to compute the correct mex based on the requirements given.

Correctness: **True**.
