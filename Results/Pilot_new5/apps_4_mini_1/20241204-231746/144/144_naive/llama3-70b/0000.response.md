To verify the correctness of the provided function according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code.

The problem describes a scenario where Alyona can reduce elements in an array to maximize the "mex" (minimum excluded value) of a new array formed from the original. The function should determine the maximum possible value of the mex after performing allowed operations.

The provided code works as follows:

1. It reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`.
2. It sorts `arr` to evaluate the elements in increasing order.
3. It initializes `mex` to 1 and iterates through the sorted `arr`. 
4. For each element `num` in `arr`:
   - If `num` equals `mex`, it increments `mex` (meaning we've accounted for that number).
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop, since it can't form a sequence that includes the current `mex`.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated `mex`.

### Potential Issues
Let's consider the edge cases to determine if the implementation properly calculates the maximum mex.

1. **Case with repeated numbers**: If the array has repeated numbers such that the highest number is skipped, it could affect the computation of `mex`. For example:
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 1`
   - The sorted array will be `[1, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, and it will only account for `1` in the `mex` calculation, thus returning `2`. The correct maximum mex should be `2` since we can reduce `5` to `2`, allowing for `1` and `2` to be included.

2. **Case with no operations needed**: If the array is already consecutive from `1` to `n`, the function should return `n + 1`. For example:
   - Input: `1 2 3 4`
   - The sorted array will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and it will correctly yield `5`.

3. **Case where `arr` has values much larger than `n`**: For an array like `1, 1000000000`, it should still yield `2` because we cannot reduce `1` further but we can reduce `1000000000`.

### Conclusion
Despite the correct logic for calculating mex under normal conditions, the function does not handle the case where multiple instances of the same number (greater than `mex`) appear or when the highest numbers are present and could be reduced to fill gaps in the sequence. This could potentially lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum mex.

Thus, since the code is not handling every potential edge case correctly and can produce an incorrect output, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False**.
