To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum possible value of the minimum excluded value (mex) of an array after potentially decreasing its elements. The mex of an array is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in a:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    print(mex)
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Mex Calculation**: The program initializes `mex` to 1, then iterates through each number in the sorted array:
    - If the current number `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex`.

### Example Cases
Let's analyze the given examples in the problem statement.

1. **Example 1**: 
   Input: `5` and `1 3 3 3 6`
   - After sorting: `1, 3, 3, 3, 6`
   - `mex` starts at `1`, then checks:
     - `1`: `mex` becomes `2`
     - `3`: `mex` becomes `3`
     - `3`: `mex` becomes `4`
     - `3`: `mex` becomes `5`
     - `6`: `mex` remains `5`
   Output: `5` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: 
   Input: `2` and `2 1`
   - After sorting: `1, 2`
   - `mex` starts at `1`, then checks:
     - `1`: `mex` becomes `2`
     - `2`: `mex` becomes `3`
   Output: `3` (Correct)

### Missing Edge Cases
However, a potential edge case arises when the array contains duplicate values that are less than the expected mex. For example:

- **Test Case**: 
  Input: `3` and `2 2 2`
  - After sorting: `2, 2, 2`
  - The code would initialize `mex` to `1`, check against `2`, and since all values are greater than `mex`, `mex` would eventually be incremented to `2` and then to `3`.
  Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Another Test Case**:
  Input: `4` and `1 1 1 1`
  - After sorting: `1, 1, 1, 1`
  - `mex` starts at `1`, and since all elements are `1`, `mex` will remain `1`.
  Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion
After considering various potential scenarios and edge cases, the program appears to handle all situations as required by the problem statement correctly. The logic of the program correctly identifies the maximum mex that can be achieved given the constraints.

Thus, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible mex for the input constraints as described.
