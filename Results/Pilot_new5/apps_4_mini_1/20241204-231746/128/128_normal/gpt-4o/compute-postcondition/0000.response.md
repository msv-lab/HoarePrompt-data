The variable `regular_sales` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged since the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n, and `regular_sales` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n, `regular_sales` is an empty list.**
