The code snippet provided sorts the `days` list in place, using the difference between the second and first elements of each tuple as the key for sorting, and does so in descending order (from highest to lowest). 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)
- `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n)
- `days` is a list containing `n` tuples (k, l) where each tuple is derived from the input

The only variable that is directly affected by the code is `days`, which will now be sorted based on the specified key.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l).**
