The variables `n` and `f` are assigned values based on the input provided by `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n). Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `f`, which are determined by the user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n)**
