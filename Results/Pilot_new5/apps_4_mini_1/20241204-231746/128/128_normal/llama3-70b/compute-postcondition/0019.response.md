Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l). If `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` and `i` is still less than `f`. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `f`, `sold` is equal to `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` and `i` remains 0.***
