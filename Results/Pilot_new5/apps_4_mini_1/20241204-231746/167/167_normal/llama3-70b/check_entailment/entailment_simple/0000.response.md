To determine the correctness of the provided annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads `n`, the number of cells visited, and then reads the list `a` of integers representing the visited cells.

2. **Matrix Dimensions Loop**:
   - The program aims to find matrix dimensions `x` and `y` such that all elements in `a` can be represented in a matrix of size `x Ã— y` where the elements follow the specific numbering format defined in the problem.

3. **Matrix Validity Check**:
   - A nested loop checks different combinations of `x` and `y` up to 1,000,000. For each combination, it checks:
     - If all visited integers `v` in `a` satisfy `1 <= v <= x * y`.
     - It then calls the function `func_1(x, y)` to ensure the movements between the cells are valid.

4. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**:
   - This function calculates the row (`nx`) and column (`ny`) of each visited integer in the matrix and checks if the absolute distance between consecutive positions corresponds to a valid move (adjacent cell) in the matrix.
   
5. **Output**:
   - If valid dimensions are found, it outputs "YES" and the dimensions. If none are found, it outputs "NO".

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The program checks every possible combination of `x` and `y` within the allowed range and verifies that:
  - All visited cells fall within the bounds of the matrix, ensuring that there is no out-of-bounds access.
  - The movements between the visited cells are valid based on adjacency rules, ensuring that the path taken is legitimate according to the matrix layout.

**Edge Cases**:
The program effectively checks edge cases:
- If a number is outside the possible range for the given `x` and `y`, it will get filtered out.
- If two consecutive numbers in `a` do not correspond to valid moves in the matrix, it will return "NO".

**Conclusion**:
The program adheres to the problem description and handles all specified constraints correctly. Therefore, the correctness evaluation of the annotated program is:

Correctness: **True**
