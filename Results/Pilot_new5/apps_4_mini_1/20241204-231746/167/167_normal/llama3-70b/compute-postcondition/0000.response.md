The variables `px` and `py` are both assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the list of integers `a` contains n integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, and `py` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the list of integers `a` contains n integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0**.
