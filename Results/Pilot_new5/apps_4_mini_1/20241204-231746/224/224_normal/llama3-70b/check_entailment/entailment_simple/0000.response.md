To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and see if it adheres to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
1. We need to define a function \( f(p) \) on a permutation \( p \) that counts the number of distinct GCDs for all prefixes of the permutation.
2. We then need to find the maximum value of \( f(p) \) over all permutations \( p \) of integers from \( 1 \) to \( n \).
3. Finally, we need to count the number of permutations where \( f(p) \) equals this maximum value, and output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analyzed Functions

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the GCD of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). The logic is correct, and it will return the GCD as intended.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \( n \).
   - It updates `res` to the maximum GCD found so far.
   - However, this function does not correctly compute \( f_{max}(n) \) because it simply computes the maximum GCD of the numbers from 1 to \( n \), not the maximum distinct GCD values from permutations.

   This function should ideally compute the maximum number of distinct GCDs achievable from permutations of integers \( 1 \) to \( n \). The logic is flawed as it does not actually fulfill the requirement of the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**:
   - This function is intended to count the number of permutations where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \).
   - However, since `f_max_n` is not set correctly in `func_2`, the counting done here may not correspond to the correct number of permutations as needed.

### Conclusion
The critical flaw lies in `func_2`, where the maximum distinct GCD values are not calculated correctly. This means that the subsequent function `func_3` will also produce incorrect results based on an incorrect `f_max_n`.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **False**
