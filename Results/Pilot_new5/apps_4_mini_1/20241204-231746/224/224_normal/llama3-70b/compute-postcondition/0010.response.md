According to the code, the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `j` is initially set to `f_max_n`, and it decrements until it reaches 1. Thus, after the last iteration, `j` must be at 1 for the loop to execute again.

At this point, since `j` is decremented by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be 0. However, because the loop iterates while `j` is greater than 0, and the state of `f_max_n` remains the same, the values must reflect the next iteration's decremented state.

Thus, the values can be summarized as follows:
- `n` remains in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` must still be at least 1.
- `MOD` remains 1000000007.
- `dp` remains a list of length `f_max_n + 1`.
- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- `dp[1]` would keep its updated value post last loop iteration.
- `dp[j]` is updated modulo 1000000007.

In conclusion, `j` should be updated to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated and then `dp[1]` is `dp[1] % 1000000007`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007`, `j` is 0.**
