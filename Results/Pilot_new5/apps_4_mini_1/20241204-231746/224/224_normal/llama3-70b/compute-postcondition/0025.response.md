According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n`, inclusive. The current state indicates that `i` is `1` at the end of the last iteration. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `i` is currently `1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, making it `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `2`, which it is according to the given range (2 <= n <= 10^6).

Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be `2`, and the loop will still be able to execute if `n` is greater than or equal to `2`.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j]` plus the original `dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`; `i` is 2; `j` is 0**
