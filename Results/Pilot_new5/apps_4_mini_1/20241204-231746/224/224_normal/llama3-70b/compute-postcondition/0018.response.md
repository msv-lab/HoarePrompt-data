According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `f_max_n` and decrements down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which means that in the next iteration, `j` will be decremented to `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`, `f_max_n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo `1000000007`.**
