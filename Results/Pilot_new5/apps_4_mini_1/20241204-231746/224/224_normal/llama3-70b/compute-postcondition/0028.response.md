The variable `dp[j]` is updated to be the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial update to `dp[j]` has already been performed in `dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, this operation ensures that the value of `dp[j]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged except for the updated value of `dp[j]`. 

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is now equal to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
