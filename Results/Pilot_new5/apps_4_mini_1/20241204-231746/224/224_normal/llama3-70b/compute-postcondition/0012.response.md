The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` will update the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is 1000000007, and `dp` is a list where `j` is an index ranging from 0 to `f_max_n`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is updated; `dp[1]` is `dp[1] % 1000000007`; `dp[0]` remains 1; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007`.**
