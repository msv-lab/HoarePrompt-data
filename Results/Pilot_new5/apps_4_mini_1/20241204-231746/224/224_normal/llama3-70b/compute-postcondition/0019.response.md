In the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. 

Given that `j` is initialized to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp` has been properly initialized with `dp[0]` equal to 1, we can infer the following:

1. `dp[j]` will now hold the value of its previous value plus the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Therefore, `dp[j]` will be updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state must reflect the updated value of `dp[j]` while including all relevant information about the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` modulo 1000000007.**
