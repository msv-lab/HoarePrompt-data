The code `dp[j] %= MOD` reduces the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. The initial state specifies that `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, with `dp[0]` set to 1, and `dp[j]` has been updated for unspecified `j`. The exact values of `dp[j]` before the modulo operation are not given, but they can be any integers based on previous operations. 

Thus, the output state indicates that `dp[j]` has been modified, but there is no specific value provided for `j`. The description of `dp` remains as is, including the fact that `dp[0]` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007` for unspecified `j`.**
