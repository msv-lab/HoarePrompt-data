The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly handles the case where `b` is 0 by returning `a` as the GCD, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD. If `a` is also 0, the GCD is conventionally defined as 0. Therefore, the function can also return 0 as the result when both inputs are 0.
