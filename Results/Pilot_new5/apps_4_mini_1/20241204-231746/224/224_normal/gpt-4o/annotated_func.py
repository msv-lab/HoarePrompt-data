#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of n modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6) and `mod` (an integer equal to 10^9 + 7), and returns the factorial of `n` computed modulo `mod`. The function correctly calculates the factorial for the given range of `n`, and since `mod` is fixed as 10^9 + 7, it effectively handles large factorial values by returning them in reduced form. There are no missing edge cases within the specified input range.
