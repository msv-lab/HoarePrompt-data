According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, it meets the requirement to allow for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 2, and it will increment until it reaches `n + 1`. The initial values of `mod` and `result` do not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed:

- `n` must be at least 2 (which it is).
- The value of `i` at the start of the loop will be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
