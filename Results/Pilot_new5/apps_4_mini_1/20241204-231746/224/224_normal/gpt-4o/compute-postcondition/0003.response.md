According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` equal to 2 and continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 3. 

Since `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (as `i` increases). 

Thus, the updated states would be: 
- `result` remains as 2 (assuming it doesn't change due to the omitted loop body),
- `i` is now 3,
- `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 2, `i` is 3**
