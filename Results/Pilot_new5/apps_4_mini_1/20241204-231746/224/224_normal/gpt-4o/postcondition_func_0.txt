The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6) and `mod` (an integer equal to 10^9 + 7), and returns the factorial of `n` computed modulo `mod`. The function correctly calculates the factorial for the given range of `n`, and since `mod` is fixed as 10^9 + 7, it effectively handles large factorial values by returning them in reduced form. There are no missing edge cases within the specified input range.
