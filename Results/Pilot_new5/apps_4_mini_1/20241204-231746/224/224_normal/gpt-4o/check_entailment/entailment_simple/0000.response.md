Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement. The problem asks for counting the number of permutations of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that the function \(f(p)\) equals the maximum value \(f_{max}(n)\). 

1. The program directly computes the factorial of \(n - 1\) when \(n > 2\). The logic used in `func_1` is intended to compute the factorial, which simply counts the number of ways to arrange \(n - 1\) items, not the number of permutations where \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).

2. The behavior of \(f(p)\) and what constitutes \(f_{max}(n)\) is not reflected in the factorial calculation. The permutations that yield the maximum distinct prefixes GCDs are specific and depend on the structure of the numbers, which is not captured by just calculating the factorial.

3. For example, if we take \(n = 3\), the program outputs \(4\) based on the factorial of \(2\), which is incorrect according to the definition of \(f(p)\) and \(f_{max}(3)\). The distinct elements among the GCDs of the prefixes of valid permutations need to be counted, rather than just arranging numbers.

Overall, the function fails to address the original problem by only calculating a factorial, which does not reflect the requirements of counting permutations with specific properties related to their GCDs. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all valid \(n\).
