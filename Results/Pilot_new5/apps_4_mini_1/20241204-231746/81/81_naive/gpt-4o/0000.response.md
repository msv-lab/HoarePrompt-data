To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` and see if it correctly counts the good pairs `(a, b)` such that `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`, while also ensuring that the pairs fall within the specified range `[l, r]`.

Let's break down the requirements and the code:

1. **Conditions for a good pair `(a, b)`**:
   - `GCD(a, b) = x`
   - `LCM(a, b) = y`
   - Both `a` and `b` must satisfy `l ≤ a, b ≤ r`.

2. **Mathematical relationships**:
   - The relationship between GCD and LCM states that for any two numbers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`. This means that if `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`, then `a * b = x * y`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program first checks if `y % x != 0`, returning `0` if true, which is correct because `y` must be a multiple of `x`.
   - It calculates `z = y // x`.
   - The loop iterates through all divisors of `z`, generating potential values for `a` and `b` as `a = i * x` and `b = (z // i) * x`.
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` are within the limits `[l, r]` and if they satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions.
   - It counts pairs, taking into account the case when `a` equals `b`.

### Potential Problematic Case:
The program does not account for the situation where `a` and `b` can be formed such that one is within the bounds but the other is not. For instance, consider `l = 1`, `r = 5`, `x = 1`, `y = 10`. Here, `GCD(1, 10) = 1`, `LCM(1, 10) = 10`. While `1` is within the bounds of `1` to `5`, `10` is not. The program would incorrectly count this as a valid pair.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not handle the case where one of the pairs generated by the divisors could fall outside the required bounds while one does not, the following conclusion can be drawn.

Correctness: **False**.
