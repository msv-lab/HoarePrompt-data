Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and a multiple of `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `z` is at least 1, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i`.***
