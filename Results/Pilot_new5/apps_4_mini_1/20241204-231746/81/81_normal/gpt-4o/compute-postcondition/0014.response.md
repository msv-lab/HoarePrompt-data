Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9. `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`. `z` is equal to `y // x`, `z` is at least 1, `count` is incremented based on the condition of `a` and `b`, which are equal or not. If `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is 1 and the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy the conditions stated. Otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `count` is 2 and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, ensuring the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`.***
