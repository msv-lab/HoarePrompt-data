The variable `a` is assigned the value of `i * x`. The value of `i` is defined as the next integer (i + 1) which must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`, meaning that `i` can take various integer values depending on `z`. The value of `x` is between 1 and `y` (also a multiple of `x`), but without specific values for `i`, `x`, or `z`, `a` will depend on the product of `i` and `x`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` is calculated based on the product of `i` and `x`, without specifying exact numerical values for these variables, as they can vary within the given constraints.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`, `i` is an integer representing (i + 1) less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`; `a` is equal to `i * x`.**
