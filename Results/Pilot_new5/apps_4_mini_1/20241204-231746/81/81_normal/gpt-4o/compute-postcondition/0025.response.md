According to the code, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(z))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which would be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to its maximum value `int(math.sqrt(z))`, it means `z` must be such that the square root is an integer. Hence, after incrementing `i`, it will become `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1`, and this new value must remain within the valid range.

In conclusion, `i` must increase to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1` for the next iteration, and there are no changes to the other variables since they do not depend on `i`.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1`**
