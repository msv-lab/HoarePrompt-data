Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is an integer representing (i + 1) less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(z)); `a` is equal to `i * x`; `b` is equal to (z // i) * x; if `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2.***
