The code assigns new values to `a` and `b` based on their previous values. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`. Since `b` is stated to be greater than 0, the operation `a % b` is valid and will yield a non-negative result.

Assuming `a` is equal to the current value of `b`, we can denote the initial values as follows:
- `a` = `b`
- `b` > 0

After the execution of the code:
- The new value of `a` will be equal to the original value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` will be `a % b`, which can now be defined as `b % b`, thus yielding 0.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `a` and `b`:
Output State: **`a` is equal to the original value of `b`; `b` is 0**.
