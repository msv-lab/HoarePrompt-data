Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value, as dividing by zero would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise an error, but this case is not handled within the function. **
