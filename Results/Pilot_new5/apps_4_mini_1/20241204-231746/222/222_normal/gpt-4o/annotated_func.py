#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `positions` is a list containing the first `m` values derived from `1, 1 + (2*k + 1), 1 + 2*(2*k + 1), ..., 1 + (m-1)*(2*k + 1)`, `i` is greater than `n`, where `m` is the maximum number of iterations such that `1 + m*(2*k + 1) > n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 1000) and `k` (between 0 and 1000) and constructs a list of integers starting from 1, incrementing by `2*k + 1` until exceeding `n`. It prints the length of this list and the elements in it as a space-separated string, but does not return any values.
