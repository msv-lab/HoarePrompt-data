The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `k`, a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 1000. The function calculates a list named `positions` that contains a sequence of integers starting from 1 and incrementing by `2*k + 1` until the next value exceeds `n`. 

After constructing the `positions` list, the function prints the length of the list and the elements of the list as a space-separated string. Notably, the function does not return any values; instead, it only outputs the results using print statements.

There are some edge cases to consider:
1. If `k` is 0, the function will add consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 until it surpasses `n`.
2. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the function will likely only contain `1` in the `positions` list and will print the length as `1`.
3. The function does not return any value but only prints the results, which may be misleading based on the annotations that suggest it returns results.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 1000) and `k` (between 0 and 1000) and constructs a list of integers starting from 1, incrementing by `2*k + 1` until exceeding `n`. It prints the length of this list and the elements in it as a space-separated string, but does not return any values. **
