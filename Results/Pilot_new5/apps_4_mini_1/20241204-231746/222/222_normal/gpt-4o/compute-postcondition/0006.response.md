`positions` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is calculated as `1 + 2*k + 1`. Therefore, `i` equals `2 + 2*k`. The value of `positions` will now contain an additional integer, which is `2 + 2*k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `2*k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 + 2*k`, `i` is equal to `2 + 2*k`.**
