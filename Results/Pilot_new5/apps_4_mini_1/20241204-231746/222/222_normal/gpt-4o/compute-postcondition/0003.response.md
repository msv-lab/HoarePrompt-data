`positions` is updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 1. The initial values for `n`, `k`, and the empty list `positions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is 1**.
