The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `i` is initially equal to `4 + 4*k`, the new value of `i` becomes `(4 + 4*k) + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `5 + 6*k`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `positions`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`, `positions` is a list containing the values 1, `2 + 2*k`, and `4 + 4*k`, `i` is `5 + 6*k`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`, `positions` is a list containing the values 1, `2 + 2*k`, and `4 + 4*k`, `i` is `5 + 6*k`.**
