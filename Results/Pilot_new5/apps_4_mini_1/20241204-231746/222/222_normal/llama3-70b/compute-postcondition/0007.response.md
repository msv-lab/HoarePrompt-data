According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `res` includes the values 1 and `k * 2 + 2.**
