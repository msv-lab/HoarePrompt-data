The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` computes a value based on the current values of `i` and `k`. The value being computed is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. The variable `i` is currently 0, which means the result of the expression will always be `1` because any multiplicative component involving `i` will be zero.

The states of the other variables `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged, as no operations affect them directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `res` now includes the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `res` includes the value 1.**
