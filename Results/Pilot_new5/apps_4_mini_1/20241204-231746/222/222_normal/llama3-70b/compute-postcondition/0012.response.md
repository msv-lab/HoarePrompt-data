The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on two constraints: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of skewers, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned on each side during one action. The function returns a value based on these two constraints, but the specific output based on the values of `n` and `k` is not provided in the information given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality or return value of the function without that information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but is based on the constraints of n (positive integer) and k (non-negative integer), returning a value based on these inputs.**
