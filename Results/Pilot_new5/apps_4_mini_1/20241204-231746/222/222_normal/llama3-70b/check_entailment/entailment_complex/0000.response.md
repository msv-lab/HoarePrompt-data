To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the program against the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The goal is to turn over all `n` skewers using the least number of actions, where turning skewer `i` turns `k` skewers from each side (i.e., skewers `i-k` to `i+k`).
2. We need to ensure that all skewers are turned over after a minimal series of operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program calculates the number of actions `l` required to turn over all skewers using the formula:
   \[
   l = \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the minimum number of operations required.
   
2. The program then constructs a list `res` that contains the indices of the skewers turned over in each action:
   \[
   \text{res} = [i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(l)]
   \]
   This means it starts turning the skewers at positions `1`, `1 + (k * 2 + 1)`, `1 + 2*(k * 2 + 1)`, etc.

### Correctness Check:
- **Does the program calculate the correct number of operations?**
  - Yes, the formula used correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to ensure all skewers are turned over. Each action affects `k * 2 + 1` skewers, so the division indicates how many full sets of skewers can be turned over.

- **Does the program print the correct skewer indices?**
  - The indices generated in `res` are the starting positions of skewers to be turned in each action, spaced by `(k * 2 + 1)`. This means:
    - The first operation turns skewers starting from index `1`.
    - The second operation would start from index `1 + (k * 2 + 1)` and so on.
  - This approach effectively ensures that the operations cover all skewers when the operations are spaced appropriately, as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem's requirements in terms of calculating the minimal number of actions and identifying the correct skewers to turn over. It systematically ensures that all skewers will be turned over using the defined logic.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
