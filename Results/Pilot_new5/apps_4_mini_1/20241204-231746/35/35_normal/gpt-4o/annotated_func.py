#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. The final value of `mid` is the largest integer for which `can_distribute(mid)` returned true, and `high` is `min(a, b) + 1` initially. If the loop executed, `low` must have been initially less than `high`, and `can_distribute(mid)` will have been evaluated multiple times, resulting in the adjustments of `low` and `high` to reach equality.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns the value of low minus 1, where low is equal to high, and both are adjusted during the execution of can_distribute(mid) evaluations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, which represents the number of plates (with a constraint of 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a`, which represents the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b`, which represents the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100). It executes a binary search to find the maximum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed among `n` plates based on the `can_distribute` function. The function returns the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed minus one. If it cannot distribute any pieces, it still returns -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ (a + b). x is a positive integer that represents the number of pieces each plate must contain.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of plates that can be filled with the pieces from both cakes (a // x + b // x) is greater than or equal to n, where a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ (a + b), and x is the number of pieces each plate must contain.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x`, representing the number of pieces each plate must contain. It returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to distribute enough pieces from two cakes of sizes `a` and `b` to fill at least `n` plates. The function checks if the total number of plates that can be filled (calculated as `a // x + b // x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer satisfying the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ (a + b)`. Edge cases may arise if `x` is greater than either `a` or `b`, potentially resulting in fewer plates being filled than expected.
