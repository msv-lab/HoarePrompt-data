The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained by 1 ≤ a ≤ 100; and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained by 1 ≤ b ≤ 100. The output of the function is the value of `low` minus 1, where `low` is equal to `high`, and both are adjusted during the execution of `can_distribute(mid)` evaluations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer representing the number of plates), a (integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake), and b (integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake), and returns the value of low minus 1 after evaluating the distribution of cake pieces.**
