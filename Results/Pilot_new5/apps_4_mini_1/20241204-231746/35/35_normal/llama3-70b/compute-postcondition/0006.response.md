The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The precondition states that `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is also greater than or equal to `x`, the constraints still hold after `x` is decremented. Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1.**
