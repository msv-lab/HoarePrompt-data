According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop that terminates it. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `b` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `x` is now equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2**
