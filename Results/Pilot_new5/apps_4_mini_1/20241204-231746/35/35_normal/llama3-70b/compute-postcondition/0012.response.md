The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `b` is an integer between `1` and `100`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
