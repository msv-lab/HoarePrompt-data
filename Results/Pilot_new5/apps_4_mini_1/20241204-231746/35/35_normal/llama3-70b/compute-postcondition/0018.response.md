The function `func` accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are provided through user input. The constraints are that `n` must be between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b`, while `a` and `b` must each be between 1 and 100. The function calculates the maximum value of `x` such that:

- `x` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`,
- The remaining amounts `(a - x)` and `(b - x)` can satisfy `x` together.

The loop iteratively decreases `x` from its starting value of `min(n, a, b)` until it finds the largest value of `x` that meets the conditions. If `min(n, a, b)` is already smaller than the required conditions, the loop will decrement `x` until it satisfies them, or until `x` is no longer feasible.

The function does not explicitly return any value; instead, it prints the resulting value of `x` after the loop completes. Notably, there is a potential edge case where `x` could be decremented to less than 0, or the loop could theoretically run indefinitely if the conditions are never satisfied due to incorrect inputs, though this scenario should be mitigated by input constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from user input, and calculates the maximum value of `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and the remaining amounts can together satisfy `x`. It prints this value of `x`, with the understanding that it should not allow `x` to become negative due to the constraints provided. **
