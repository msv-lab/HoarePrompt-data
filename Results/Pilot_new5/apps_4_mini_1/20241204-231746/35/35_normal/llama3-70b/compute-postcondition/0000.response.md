The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values based on user input, where the input consists of three space-separated integers. The previous conditions remain valid, but now the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be set according to that input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `n`, `a`, and `b` are now set to the values obtained from input.**
