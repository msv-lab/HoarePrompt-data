Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the time needed to grill K pieces of meat. Specifically, the implementation of `func_1` has a flaw in the logic that determines if the current heat source position `mx, my` can grill at least K pieces of meat within time T. 

Here is a potential case where it fails:

1. Consider the input:
   ```
   3 2
   0 0 1
   1 1 1
   2 2 1
   ```
   If we set T = 1, the function should check if we can grill at least 2 pieces of meat within this time. The distance calculations and the way `d` and `d2` are handled could lead to incorrect evaluations of whether enough pieces of meat can be grilled within the given time.

2. The binary search in `func_2` may not converge correctly to the minimum time due to precision issues with the stopping condition `while high - low > 1e-07`. The initial values of low and high could lead to a case where the best solution is missed or incorrectly calculated.

Thus, because of these potential logical issues and edge cases not being handled correctly, the program is deemed incorrect.
