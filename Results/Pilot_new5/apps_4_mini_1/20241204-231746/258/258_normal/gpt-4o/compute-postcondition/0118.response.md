The line `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the values from the tuple `meats[i]` to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` now depend on the specific tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list. The other variables (`my`, `count`, `d`, `K`, `N`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` remains less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1` is the first value of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second value of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third value of `meats[i]`.
