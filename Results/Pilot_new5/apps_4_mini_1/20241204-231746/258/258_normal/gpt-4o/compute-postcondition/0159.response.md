To calculate the output state after executing the given code snippet, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code itself.

### Initial State:
- `my` is updated to the final calculated value.
- `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`.
- `i` is `N - 2`.
- `j` is `N - 1`.
- `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.
- `d2` is now equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
- It holds that if `(d * d2) > d2`, the loop continues.

### Code Analysis:
```
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```
1. `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
2. The calculation involves `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.

### Substituting Values:
- `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is as defined.
- `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy`.
- `d` has been updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`.

### Resulting State:
Now we know the calculation for `mx` involves the above expressions. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State:
**`my` is updated to the final calculated value, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is N - 2, `j` is N - 1, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `count` is greater than or equal to K, `d2` is now equal to dx * dx + dy * dy, `mx` is equal to cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
