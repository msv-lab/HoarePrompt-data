The variable `cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The other variables (`my`, `count`, and `d`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
