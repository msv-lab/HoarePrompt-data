Output State: **If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then `count` remains the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 )`, and `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
