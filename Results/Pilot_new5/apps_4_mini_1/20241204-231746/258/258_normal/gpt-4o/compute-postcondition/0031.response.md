Postcondition: ***`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` is set to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is set to `meats[j][1]`, and `c1` is set to `meats[j][2]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.***
