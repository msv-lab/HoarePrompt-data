The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` will determine the specific value of `dy`, but since their exact values are not provided, we cannot determine `dy` specifically. However, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
