Postcondition: ***`my` is updated based on the calculations involving `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. The variable `count` reflects the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T` and is currently less than `K`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True; otherwise, there is no return value.***
