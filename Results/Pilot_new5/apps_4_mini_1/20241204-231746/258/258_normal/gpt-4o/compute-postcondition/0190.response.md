Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the previous value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` is equal to the previous value of `c1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
