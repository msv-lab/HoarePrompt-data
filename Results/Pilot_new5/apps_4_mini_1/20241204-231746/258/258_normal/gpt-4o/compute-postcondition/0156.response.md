Postcondition: ***`my` is updated to the final calculated value, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is N - 2, `j` is N - 1, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, `d2` is now equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and it holds that (d * d2) is greater than d2.***
