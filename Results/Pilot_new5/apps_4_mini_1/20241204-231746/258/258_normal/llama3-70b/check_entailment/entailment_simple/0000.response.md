To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description and performs the necessary calculations correctly.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of pieces of meat (`N`) and the number of pieces (`K`) that Takahashi wants to eat. It then collects the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat in the `meats` list.

2. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - The function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)` calculates the Euclidean distance between the heat source located at `(X, Y)` and a piece of meat located at `(x, y)`.
   - This is done using the formula `sqrt((X - x)**2 + (Y - y)**2)`, which is correct.

3. **Time Calculation**: 
   - The function `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` calculates the time required for each piece of meat to be ready, considering the hardness `c` of each piece of meat and the distance calculated by `func_1`. 
   - It returns a list of times for each piece of meat: `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)`. This is also correct as it aligns with the problem description.

4. **Finding Minimum Time**: 
   - The `func_3()` function iterates through all possible integer coordinates for placing the heat source `(X, Y)` in the range `[-1000, 1000]`.
   - It calls `func_2` for each combination of `(X, Y)` to compute the times, sorts those times, and keeps track of the minimum time required for at least `K` pieces of meat.
   - The program correctly accesses the `K-1` index after sorting the times list to get the K-th fastest time.

5. **Output**: The program returns the minimum time found, which is consistent with the goal of minimizing the time to grill `K` pieces of meat.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It ensures that:
- The correct distances are calculated.
- The times are computed based on hardness and distance.
- The optimal placement for the heat source is found by evaluating all possible integer coordinates in the specified range and determining the minimum time for at least `K` pieces of meat.

Since all aspects of the program align with the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
