N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, (x_i, y_i) are the coordinates of the i-th piece of meat for i from 1 to N, where x_i and y_i are integers in the range -1000 to 1000 and (x_i, y_i) are unique for all i, and c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 100 for each i from 1 to N.
