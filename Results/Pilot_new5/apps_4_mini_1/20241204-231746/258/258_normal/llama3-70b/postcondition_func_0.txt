The function accepts four real number parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y). The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as invalid input types (non-numeric values) or the situation where the input points are identical, which would result in a distance of 0.
