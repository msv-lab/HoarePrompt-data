The variable `times` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state includes that `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, which is not explicitly defined but will contain values based on `x` and `y`. Since `x` is -999 and `y` is 1000, the content of `times` will depend on the implementation of `func_2`. The variable `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` is now sorted, `ans` will be updated to the new minimum value at the same index. Other variables do not change.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
