The list `times` is sorted in ascending order, changing its original order. The prior values of `times` are `[-999, -999, 1001, 1001]`. After sorting, the values remain the same because they are already in order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1001, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is `[-999, -999, 1001, 1001]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
