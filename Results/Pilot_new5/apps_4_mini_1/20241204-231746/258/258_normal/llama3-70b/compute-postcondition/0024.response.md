According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). The last recorded value of `y` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. Since `y` is currently 1000 at the end of the last iteration, it will not execute again because the range has been exhausted. The next value of `y` would be 1001, which is outside the defined range. 

In this situation, since `y` is already at the maximum value, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, there is no valid adjustment to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1001, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted version of its previous values, `ans` remains unchanged**
