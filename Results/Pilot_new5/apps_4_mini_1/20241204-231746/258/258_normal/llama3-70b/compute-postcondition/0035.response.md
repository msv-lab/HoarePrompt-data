The code assigns the value of `times` to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but the value of `times` will depend on the output of the function `func_2` when called with those specific values. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the result of func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999), and `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**.
