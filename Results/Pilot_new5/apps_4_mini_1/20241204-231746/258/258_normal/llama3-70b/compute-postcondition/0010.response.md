According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than 1001. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999, and thus the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1, making `y` equal to -998. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `y` must be -998, and since `x`, `K`, `times`, and `ans` are not affected by the loop iteration index but are rather part of the state before entering the loop, they remain unchanged.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, times[K - 1])**
