According to the code, the loop executes for values of `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The loop starts with `y` initialized to -1000 and will increment `y` by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 1000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, it would need to increment `y` to 1001. However, since the range defined in the for loop is capped at 1000, it cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be less than 1000, meaning it can only potentially execute if we consider a prior state where `y` is still less than 1000. Since `y` is currently at 1000, this indicates that the loop has completed its iterations.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**
