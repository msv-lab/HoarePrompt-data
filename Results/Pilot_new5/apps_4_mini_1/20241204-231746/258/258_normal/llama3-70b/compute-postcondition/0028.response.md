The loop iterates over the range of `y` from -1000 to 1000. For each value of `y`, it calculates a new list `times` using the function `func_2`, which is then sorted. The variable `ans` is updated to hold the minimum value between its previous value and the `K-th` element of the sorted `times` list. 

Since `y` iterates from -1000 to 1000, the loop will execute a total of 2001 times (from -1000 to 1000 inclusive). Therefore, `y` will take values from -1000 to 1000, and `ans` will contain the minimum of the `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.

After all iterations are complete, `y` will be 1000 (the last value of the loop), `ans` will reflect the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` over all 2001 iterations, and `times` will have been computed and sorted for each `y` within the loop.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted across all iterations, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations of `y`.**
