The code snippet provided involves sorting the `times` list. The initial values of variables are:

- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is assigned the value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`
- `ans` is updated to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`

After executing the code `times.sort()`, the order of elements in the `times` list is modified to be sorted in ascending order. However, the specific values in `times` and `ans` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact results of these variables.

The states of other variables `x`, `y`, and `K` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the sorting process.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted.**
