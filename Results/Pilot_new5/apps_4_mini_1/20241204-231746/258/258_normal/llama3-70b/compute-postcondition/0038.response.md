According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The range for `y` is from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will need to be incremented by 1, making it -998. Since the loop continues until `y` reaches 1000, after this increment, `y` will be -998, and the loop can execute again as the range allows for more iterations.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**
