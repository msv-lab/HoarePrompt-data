The code snippet contains a function call `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, which likely processes the values of `x` and `y` and returns a value assigned to `times`. The specific behavior of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output of `times`. However, we know that the output of `func_2` will be assigned to `times`. 

After running the code, the variable `times` now holds the output of `func_2`, but its specific content is not defined in the initial state. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. 

Since we do not have the initial value of `ans` or the output of `func_2`, we can't provide a concrete value. Therefore, we will keep `ans` noted with respect to its update.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, times[K - 1])**
