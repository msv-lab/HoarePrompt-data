The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates with three integer variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are constrained such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the operations performed with these integers. The specific return value and conditions are not provided, so I can only state that the function will return an integer based on the defined behavior within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns an integer based on internal calculations involving integers n, a, and b, which are constrained to be between 1 and 10,000,000.**
