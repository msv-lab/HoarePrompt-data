The code snippet outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The variable `x` is already set to `1`. The variable `y` is previously defined as `(n - x * a) // b`. Since `x` is `1`, we can substitute that into the expression for `y`, giving us `y = (n - 1 * a) // b`, which simplifies to `y = (n - a) // b`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least `1`, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
