Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and checks if it is possible to express `n` as a combination of multiples of `a` and `b`. If such a combination exists, it outputs 'YES' followed by the counts of `a` and `b` used; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly, so it effectively returns `None`. **
