The code prints 'YES', which does not affect any variables in the program. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b` (the value of `b` is not provided, but its effect on `y` is noted).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b`**.
