In the provided code snippet, `print(x, y)` outputs the current values of `x` and `y`. The variable `x` is explicitly stated to be `0`, and `y` is calculated as `n // b`, where `n` is greater than or equal to `0` (but its specific value is unknown at this point) and `b` is not defined in the initial state. 

Since `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `y`, but we know that `y` is defined as `n // b`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged except for the values of `x` and `y` being printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b` and the values printed are 0 and `y`.**
