The variables `n` and `s` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The previous values of `n` and `s` are overwritten with the new values parsed from the input. The list `v` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated values of `n` and `s` based on the user input while maintaining the information about the constraints of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and `v` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 10^9), with `n` and `s` updated based on user input.**
