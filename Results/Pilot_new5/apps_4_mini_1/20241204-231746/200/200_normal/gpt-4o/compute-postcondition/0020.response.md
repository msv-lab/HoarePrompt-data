The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we simply know that the execution will continue to the next loop iteration without making any modifications or returning any specific values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
