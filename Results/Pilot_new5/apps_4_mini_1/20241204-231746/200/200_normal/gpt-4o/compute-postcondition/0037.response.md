Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated to equal `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `remaining_kvass` remains greater than 0 while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `min_keg_volume` is printed.**
