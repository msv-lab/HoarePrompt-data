Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description and correctly handles all specified cases. Here's a detailed explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the amount of kvass to be poured), followed by reading the volumes of the kegs into a list.

2. **Total Volume Check**: It calculates the total volume of kvass in all kegs. If the total volume is less than `s`, it correctly prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to pour the desired amount of kvass.

3. **Volume Redistribution Logic**: If the total volume is sufficient (greater than or equal to `s`), it proceeds to determine how much kvass can remain in the least filled keg (`min_keg_volume`). The program iterates through the sorted list of volumes, trying to take from other kegs to reach the desired volume `s`.

4. **Minimizing the Least Keg's Volume**: The logic allows kvass to be taken from kegs that have more than the minimum keg volume. For each keg, it determines how much can be taken without reducing the minimum keg volume below its current value. If there are remaining liters to be taken after going through the kegs, it distributes the remaining kvass evenly across all kegs by adjusting the minimum keg volume accordingly. 

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the adjusted minimum keg volume, which is consistent with the requirement to maximize the quantity in the least keg while fulfilling the total kvass demand.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `s` is larger than the total volume of kvass and when there is only one keg. It also ensures that after trying to pour `s` liters, the output is the maximum possible volume in the least keg, which aligns perfectly with the problem description requirements.

Thus, the program meets the constraints and specifications outlined in the problem description.
