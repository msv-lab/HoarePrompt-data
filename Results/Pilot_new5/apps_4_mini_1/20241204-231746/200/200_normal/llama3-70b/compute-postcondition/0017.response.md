Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, and `low` must remain less than `high`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, while `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`.***
