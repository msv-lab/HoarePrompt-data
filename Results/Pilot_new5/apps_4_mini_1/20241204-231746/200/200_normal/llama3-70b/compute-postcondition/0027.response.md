Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, the loop has terminated, `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, `total` is equal to `s`, indicating that the original minimum value of `v` was sufficient to reach `s`. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `mid` is the average of the final `low` and `high` values in the last iteration. `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `s` is a positive integer.***
