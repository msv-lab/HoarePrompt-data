The variable `total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `x`. The initial state indicates that `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and each element of `x` satisfies the condition 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000. As a result, `total_x` becomes the total sum of these integers in the list `x`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to `sum(x)`.**
