The code `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console. It does not change any variable values or the state of any variables. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `x`, and `y` remain valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers; `y` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and the lists `x` and `y` are not equal. 'No' has been printed.**
