The `sort` method is called on the list `y`, which will rearrange the elements in `y` in ascending order. Since `y` is already stated to be a list of non-negative integers, the state of `y` does change, but the other variables remain unaffected. The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and since `x` is already sorted, it does not change.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers; `y` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
