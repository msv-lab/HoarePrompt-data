Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers from input; `y` is now a list of `n` non-negative integers from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000. The sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.***
