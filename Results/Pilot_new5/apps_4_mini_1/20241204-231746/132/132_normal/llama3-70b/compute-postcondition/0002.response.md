The variable `y` is assigned a new value that is a list of integers obtained from the input. The input consists of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. The values of `y_i` in the list must adhere to the condition 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000. The previous state of `n` and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers from input; `y` is now a list of `n` non-negative integers from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000.**
