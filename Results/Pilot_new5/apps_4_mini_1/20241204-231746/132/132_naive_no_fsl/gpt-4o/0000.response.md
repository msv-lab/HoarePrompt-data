Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it only checks if the total number of stones in the second observation (`total_y`) is greater than in the first (`total_x`). However, the problem allows for the possibility of moving stones between piles and taking stones away, meaning that the number of stones in the piles can change as long as the total number of stones does not increase.

Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
3 1 2
1 2 3
```
In this case, `total_x` is 6 and `total_y` is also 6. The program would output "Yes" because `total_y` is not greater than `total_x`. However, this transformation is impossible because there are not enough stones in the first piles to transform them into the second piles. Specifically, to go from `3` in the first pile to `1` in the second pile, the program must indicate that at least `2` stones are taken away without any jury members moving stones.

Thus, the program fails to consider configurations that would require the total number of stones to be decreased in a manner that cannot be achieved through the allowed operations. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
