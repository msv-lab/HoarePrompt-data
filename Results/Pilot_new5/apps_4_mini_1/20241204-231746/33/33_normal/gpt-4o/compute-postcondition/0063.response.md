Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `position` is the final position after all movements, constrained between 0 and 20000; `valid` is set to False since `position` is not equal to 0; `t` is the last integer input processed; `dir` is the last direction processed. If `position` were equal to 0, `valid` would remain True, but since it is not, `valid` is False after this check.***
