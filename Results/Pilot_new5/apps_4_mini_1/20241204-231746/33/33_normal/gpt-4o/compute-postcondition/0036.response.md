The value of `position` is updated by adding `t` to it. The previous value of `position` was either `0` or `20000`, and since `t` is an integer, the new value of `position` will be `position + t`. If this new value exceeds `20000`, the condition is met, but since there is no else part, we only update `position`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `position` has been updated based on the addition of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is updated to `position + t`, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'.**
