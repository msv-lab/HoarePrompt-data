Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `position` is 0 or 20000, the variables retain their values. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else condition specified.***
