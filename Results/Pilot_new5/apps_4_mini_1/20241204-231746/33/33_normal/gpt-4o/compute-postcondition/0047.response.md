The value of `valid` is explicitly set to `False`, which means there is no change to its previous state since it already held the value `False`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.**
