Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'. If `position + t` is greater than 20000, the condition is met and the corresponding actions defined in the if part will be executed. Otherwise, since there is no else part, no changes will occur to the variables.***
