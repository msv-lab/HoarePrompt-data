Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is decreased by `t`. If `dir` is 'South', `position` remains unchanged provided that `position + t` does not exceed 20000. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', the variables retain their values if `position` is 0 or 20000; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
