The function accepts a positive integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers and directions. It tracks a position that starts at 0 and can move based on the directions ("North", "South", "West", "East") with specified distances. If the movement would cause the position to go below 0 or above 20,000, or if the position is not back to 0 at the end, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function validates each move to ensure it remains within the constraints and checks the final position for validity.
