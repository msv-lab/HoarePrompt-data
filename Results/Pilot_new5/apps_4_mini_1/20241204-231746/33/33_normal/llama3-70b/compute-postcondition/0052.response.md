The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further lines of code will be executed after this point, and any changes to variable states that might occur afterward won't take place. The variables `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` retain their previous values, but the program is effectively stopped.

The output state is based on the information that remains valid. Since the program exits without changing any values, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range; 'NO' is printed.**
