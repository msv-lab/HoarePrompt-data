According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be between 1 and 50, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. The variable `curr_lat` is set to 90 but does not influence the loop execution. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with an unused loop variable (`_`). 

Thus, before the loop starts, `n` is already a valid input that allows the loop to execute, and `_` will start from 0 in the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is 90**
