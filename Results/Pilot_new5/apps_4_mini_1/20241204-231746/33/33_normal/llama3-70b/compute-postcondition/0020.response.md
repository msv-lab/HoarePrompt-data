The code `exit()` is a command that terminates the execution of the program. As a result, the program will stop running, and no further changes to the variable states will occur. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the state can be described as having exited the program.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is within the valid range of -90 to 90 and is currently -90, `dir` is not 'North', and 'NO' is printed to the console; the program has exited.**
