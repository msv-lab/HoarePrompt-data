`The code snippet prints 'NO'. The value of `curr_lat` is within valid latitude bounds, and the value of `dir` is not specified in the context provided, but since the condition where `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North' leads to printing 'NO', we can conclude that this condition is satisfied. The states of other variables are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and 'NO' is printed.**

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and 'NO' is printed.**
