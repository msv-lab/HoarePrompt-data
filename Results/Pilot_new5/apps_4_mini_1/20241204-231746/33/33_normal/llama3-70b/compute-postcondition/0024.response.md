The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variable values are changed during the execution of this code, but the program's execution is stopped, and it will not proceed further. The output state reflects that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50); `curr_lat` is 90; `dir` is not 'South'; 'NO' is printed to the console; the program has exited.**
