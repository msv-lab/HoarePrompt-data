The line `print('NO')` does not change any variable values; it merely outputs the string 'NO'. The previous conditions regarding `curr_lat` being within the valid latitude range still hold true. If `curr_lat` is outside the range of -90 to 90, 'NO' is printed, which signifies an invalid latitude. However, since no variable is assigned or modified in this code snippet, the rest of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and 'NO' is printed.**
