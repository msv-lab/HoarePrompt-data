The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified or returned, and the program does not continue execution. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is -90; 'NO' is printed; program execution has been terminated.**
