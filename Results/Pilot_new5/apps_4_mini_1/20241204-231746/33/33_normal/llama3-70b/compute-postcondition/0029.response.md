The value of `curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The variable `t` is an input integer, and `curr_lat` was not defined in the initial state, so its current value is unknown. The values of `n` and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195.**
