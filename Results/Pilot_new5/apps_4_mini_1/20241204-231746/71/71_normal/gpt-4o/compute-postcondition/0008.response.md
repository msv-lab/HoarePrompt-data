The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `to_remove` is 0, so after the increment, `to_remove` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 1; and `digit` is not '0'.
