Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; if the current value of `count_zeros` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0; otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1.***
