The variable `max_count` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`; `max_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`; `max_count` is 0.**
