The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` now contains `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0.
