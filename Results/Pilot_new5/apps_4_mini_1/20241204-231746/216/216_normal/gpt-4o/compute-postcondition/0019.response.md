Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character in `s`, if `char` is not in `current_set`, and `char` is a lowercase letter, then `char` is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, no changes are made to `current_set` or `current_count`.***
