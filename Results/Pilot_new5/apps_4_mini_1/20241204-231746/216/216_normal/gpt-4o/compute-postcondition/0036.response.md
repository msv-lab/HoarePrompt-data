Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters of length `n`. It calculates the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in consecutive segments of the string. The function then prints this maximum count, which may be zero if there are no lowercase letters present in the string.**
