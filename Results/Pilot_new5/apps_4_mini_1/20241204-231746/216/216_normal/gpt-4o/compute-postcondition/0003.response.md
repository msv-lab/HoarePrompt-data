The code initializes `current_set` as an empty set. None of the other variables' values are affected by this operation; thus, the conditions for `n`, `s`, and `max_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set.**
