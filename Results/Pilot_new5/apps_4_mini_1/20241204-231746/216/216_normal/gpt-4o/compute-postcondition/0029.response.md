The `current_set.clear()` method is called, which removes all elements from the `current_set`. Since `current_set` is now empty, it changes its state but does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_count`, or `max_count`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` is now empty, `current_count` remains unchanged, and `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.**
