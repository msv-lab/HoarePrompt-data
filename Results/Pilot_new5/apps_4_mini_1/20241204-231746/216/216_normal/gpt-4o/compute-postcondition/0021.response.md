The call to `current_set.clear()` empties the `current_set`. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged after this operation, as only `current_set` is affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character in `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is updated based on `char`, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and `current_count`.**
