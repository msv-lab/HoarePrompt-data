The variable `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts user input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The previous conditions still apply: `n` must remain within the range of 1 to 200, and `s` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length n, `n` is an input integer.**
