The code prints the value of `max_count`. The values of `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged, while `max_count` retains its previously assigned value, which is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is 0, the value of `max_count` remains the same as its previous value.

Output State: **`max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`.**
