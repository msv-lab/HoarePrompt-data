`marks_set` is assigned the value of a set created from the list `marks`, which removes any duplicate values and allows for efficient membership testing. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `marks_set` now holds the unique elements from the `marks` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` is a list of integers from input, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from `marks`.**
