To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the `marks` list. The loop will iterate over each element in the `marks` list, so we need to ensure that this list is not empty. 

1. **Check `marks`**: For the loop to execute, `marks` must contain at least one element. Since the state mentions that `marks` is a list with `n` elements, we can conclude that if `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.
   
2. **Initialization of `mark`**: At the start of the loop, the variable `mark` will take the value of the first element in the `marks` list. Therefore, we need to set `mark` to the first element of `marks`.

3. **Other state variables**: The other state variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `x_found`, `y_found`, `new_marks`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but we note that either `x_found` or `y_found` must be false to satisfy the condition given in the problem statement.

Based on these points, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 0 so that `marks` has at least one element.
- `mark` should be initialized to the first element of `marks`.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False**
