Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False. If `y_found` is not true and either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark + y`. If none of those conditions are satisfied and either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y`; otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
