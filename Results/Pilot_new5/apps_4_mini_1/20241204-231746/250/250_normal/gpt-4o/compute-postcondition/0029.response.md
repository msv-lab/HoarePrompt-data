Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with `n` elements, `x_found` is True if there exists any `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if there exists any `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, they remain true; otherwise, they reflect whether their respective conditions were satisfied.**
