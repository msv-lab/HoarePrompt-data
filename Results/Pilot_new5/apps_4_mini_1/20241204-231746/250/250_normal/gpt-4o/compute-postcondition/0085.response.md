The code `result.append(y)` appends the current value of `y` to the list `result`. Given that `y_found` is currently `False`, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implicitly assumed to be some value that will be added to `result`. Since `x_found` is `False`, `result` contains the value of `x` as stated in the initial conditions.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that `y` has been added to the existing list `result`, which originally contains the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `new_marks` is an empty set, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` is a list containing `x` and `y` has been appended to `result`.**
