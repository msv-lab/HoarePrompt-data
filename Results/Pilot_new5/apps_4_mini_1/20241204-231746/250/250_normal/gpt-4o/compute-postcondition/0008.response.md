Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least one element, and `mark` is the first element in `marks`. If either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
