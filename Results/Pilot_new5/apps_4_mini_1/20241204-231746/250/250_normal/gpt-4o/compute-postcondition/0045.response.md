Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and it is currently true that `y_found` is not true. The condition that either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` is true, therefore `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
