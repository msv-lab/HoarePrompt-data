The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least one element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is True, `y_found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
