The variable `additional_marks` is updated by appending the value of `i + j` to it. The initial state confirms that `additional_marks` already contains at least 4 viable values, and `j` is defined as the next viable value in `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is not specified but is used in the addition to `j`. 

Since `additional_marks` is modified by appending a new value (which is the sum of `i` and `j`), the other variables (`n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `marks`, `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 4 viable values and now contains at least 5 values, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `j` is the next viable value in `additional_marks`.**
