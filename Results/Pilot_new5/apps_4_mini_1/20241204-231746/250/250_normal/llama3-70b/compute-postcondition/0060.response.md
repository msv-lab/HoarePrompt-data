Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`. If there are no such pairs, `need_x` and `need_y` remain False.**
