According to the code, the loop iterates over the `additional_marks` list. For the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element after the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least one value, we can assume that it has more elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next element in the `additional_marks` list. Therefore, if `additional_marks` originally had at least two elements, after processing the first, `j` will take on the second element in the list. 

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 viable values, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`.**
