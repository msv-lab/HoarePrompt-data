Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 viable value, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes the value `i + j`.***
