According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute because `0 < n` is always true for the provided constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000). At the end of the last iteration, the variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1`.

To summarize, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are that `i` is less than `n`, which is already satisfied. Therefore, for the loop to be executed correctly:

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0**
