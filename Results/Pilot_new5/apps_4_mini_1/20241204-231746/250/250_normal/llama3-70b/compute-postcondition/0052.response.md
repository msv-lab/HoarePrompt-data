In this case, the code is simply assigning the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The previous state indicates that `need_y` remains unchanged, but since the code explicitly sets it to `True`, it is effectively updated to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, and the condition about `marks`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`.**
