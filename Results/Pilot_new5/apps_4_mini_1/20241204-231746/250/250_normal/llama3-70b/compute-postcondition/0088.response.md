According to the code, the loop iterates over `additional_marks`, which contains at least 3 viable values at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least 4 viable values. 

Since `j` represents the current value from `additional_marks`, and the loop iterates through all values in this list, after the last iteration, `j` would be the last element in `additional_marks`. Thus, `j` will be set to the next value in `additional_marks` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must still contain at least 4 viable values. If `additional_marks` originally contained `k` values, then `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 4 viable values, and `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `j` is the next viable value in `additional_marks`**
