According to the code, the loop will iterate over `additional_marks`. Given that `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements, the current iteration has likely processed one element, which means one must still remain for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, so after processing one element, there should be at least 1 element left for the loop to continue. 

Since `j` will take on the next value from `additional_marks`, if the loop executes one more time, `j` will then be the second element (if it was the first element in the previous iteration). 

Thus, `additional_marks` should still contain at least 1 element (the second one), and we can infer that `j` must be the second value in the list. 

The state before the next iteration should reflect that `j` is taking the next item in `additional_marks`. Therefore, we need to adjust the relevant states accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`**
