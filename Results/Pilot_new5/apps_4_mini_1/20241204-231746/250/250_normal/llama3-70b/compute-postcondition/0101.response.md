The value of `additional_marks` is updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of `i` (the second element of `marks`) and `j` (the next element in `additional_marks`). The other variables remain unchanged, but the content of `additional_marks` will now include this new sum.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` is updated to include the new element `i + j`, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.**
