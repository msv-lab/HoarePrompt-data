Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`, while `marks` remains unchanged.***
