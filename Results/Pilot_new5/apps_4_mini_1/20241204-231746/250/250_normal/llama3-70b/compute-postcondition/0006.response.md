The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. None of the other variables or states are affected by this assignment. The initial state of `n`, `i`, and the expression `marks[j] - marks[i] = x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`; `need_x` is True.**
