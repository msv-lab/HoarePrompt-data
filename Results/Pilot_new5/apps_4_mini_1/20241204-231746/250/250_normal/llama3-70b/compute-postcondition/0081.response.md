According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `additional_marks`. The loop will only execute if `additional_marks` contains at least one element. Since `additional_marks` contains all viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, we need to ensure that:

1. There is at least one viable value in `additional_marks` for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `j` will take the first element from `additional_marks` during the first iteration.

Given that `marks` must contain at least one element, we also need to confirm that `i` is reset to the first element of `marks` or that new elements must be added to `marks` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments could be made as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 viable value, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is reset to the first element of `marks`, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`**
