To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the loop structure.

Initial State: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 2, `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over `j` from `i` (which is 2) to `n - 1`. During each iteration, it checks the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` against the values `x` and `y`, setting `need_x` and `need_y` to `True` if the conditions are met.

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:

- The loop will execute `(n - 1) - i + 1` times which simplifies to `n - 2` times.
- After the loop completes, `j` will have taken all values from `i` to `n - 1`, meaning it will end at `n - 1`.

Now, we will consider the output state based on the possible outcomes of the loop execution:

1. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x` for any `j` in the range, then `need_x` will be `True`.
2. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y` for any `j` in the range, then `need_y` will be `True`.
3. If neither condition is satisfied for all `j`, then `need_x` and `need_y` will remain unchanged.

Since `j` varies from `i` to `n - 1`, we need to state the output conditions based on the final values of `need_x` and `need_y` after all iterations:

- The values of `need_x` and `need_y` depend on whether the conditions were met during the iterations. 
- If the loop executes `n - 2` times, then `j` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration.

### Conclusion of the Output State

Since `need_x` and `need_y` can potentially be `True` or `False` based on the conditions evaluated during the loop execution, we will conclude with the general states of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `need_x` is True if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y.`**
