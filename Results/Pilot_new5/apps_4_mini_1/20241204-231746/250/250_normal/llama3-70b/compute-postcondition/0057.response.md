The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `marks`, `x`, and the conditions about the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]`) remain unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, the conditions specified are maintained.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, the conditions specified are maintained.**
