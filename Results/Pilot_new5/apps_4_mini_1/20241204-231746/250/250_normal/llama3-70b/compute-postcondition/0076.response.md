According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. Since it contains at least 1 element, it allows for the loop to iterate once more. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`. Assuming `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, if `j` was the second element, it will now be the third element in the next iteration. 

We also need to ensure that the conditions related to `i + j`, `l`, and `marks` remain valid for the next iteration. Since the value of `i` does not change within the loop and since `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l`, we assume `i + j` must still not be in `marks` for the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `j` has moved to the next element in `additional_marks`, while maintaining that `i + j` is still valid with respect to `l` and `marks`.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`** (assuming it has at least 3 elements).
