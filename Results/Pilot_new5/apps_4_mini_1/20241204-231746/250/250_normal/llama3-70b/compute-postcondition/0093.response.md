To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we must analyze the conditions surrounding the `additional_marks` iterable in the context of the for loop statement.

1. The loop will iterate over `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element.

2. The variable `need_x` is set to False, which might indicate that some condition related to `x` is not met but is not directly relevant for the execution of this loop.

3. Similarly, `need_y` is also set to False, which again may indicate some unmet condition but does not directly impact the loop's execution.

4. The variable `additional_marks` is composed of viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`. Given that `i` is the second element of `marks`, we should ensure that there are possible values of `j` such that `i + j` results in values that fit the criteria for `additional_marks`.

5. To ensure that `additional_marks` has at least one element, we need to confirm that the combination of `i` (the second element of `marks`) and some potential values of `j` (that are not in `marks` and satisfy `i + j ≤ l`) can yield at least one valid value.

6. Since `marks` contains at least two elements, we need to ensure that there are values of `j` that meet the criteria of not being in `marks` and also satisfy the condition that `i + j ≤ l`.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that:

- For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must not be empty.
- Therefore, we need to confirm there is at least one valid value for `j` such that `i + j ≤ l` and `j` is not in `marks`.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element, `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and there exists a valid `j` such that `i + j ≤ l` and `j` is not in `marks`.**
