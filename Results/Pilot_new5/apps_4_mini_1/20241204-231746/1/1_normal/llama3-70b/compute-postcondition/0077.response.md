Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, since `bind` is greater than `ind`, `ans` is equal to the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]` and `ans` is printed.***
