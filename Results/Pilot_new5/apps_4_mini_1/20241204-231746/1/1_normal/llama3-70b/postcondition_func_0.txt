The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000. It searches for the first occurrence of a ':' that follows at least one '[' and the last occurrence of a ':' that precedes at least one ']'. If either ':' can't be found or if the first ':' is not before the last ':', it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts the number of '|' characters between these two ':' characters and prints that count plus 4.
