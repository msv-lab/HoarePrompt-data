The function accepts a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. It attempts to find the first occurrence of '[' and the last occurrence of ']' in the string. If these characters are not found or are in the wrong order, it returns -1. If valid, it then looks for the first ':' after the '[' and the last ':' before the ']', counting the number of '|' characters between these two colons. The function finally returns the count of '|' plus 4. If there are no colons or pipes in the relevant sections, it also returns -1.
