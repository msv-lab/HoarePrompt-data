The value of `n` is assigned the length of `s`. Since `s` is defined as a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, and has a length between 1 and 500,000, the value of `n` will reflect the current length of `s` after input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is equal to `len(s)`**.
