The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state confirms that `i` is equal to `ind + 2`. Other variables' states remain unchanged and valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ind + 2`; `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`; `ind` is less than `bind - 1;` `start_colon` is `ind + 2`.
