The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `bind` is `n - 1`; the current value of `s[i]` is ']'; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
