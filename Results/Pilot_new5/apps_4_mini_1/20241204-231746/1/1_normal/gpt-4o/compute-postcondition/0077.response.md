The value of `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. The other variables `s`, `n`, `i`, and the conditions for `bind`, `ind`, `end_colon`, and `start_colon` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `pipe_count` is `pipe_count + 1`; conditions for `bind`, `ind`, `end_colon`, and `start_colon` remain valid; `i` must be less than `end_colon - 1`.
