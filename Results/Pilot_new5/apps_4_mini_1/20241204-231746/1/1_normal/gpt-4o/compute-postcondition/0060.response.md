To determine the modified states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop structure and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates in reverse from `bind - 1` to `ind`, decrementing `i` in each iteration. Based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `i` is `bind - 2`
- `bind` is not -1
- `ind` is less than `bind - 2`
- `n` is greater than 0

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is `bind - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be:

- New `i` = `bind - 2 - 1` = `bind - 3`

Next, we need to consider the loop's condition. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `ind`. Given that `ind` is less than `bind - 2`, it implies that `ind` is also less than `bind - 3`. Hence:

- For the loop to execute again, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`.

Now, we can summarize the updated state:

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 3`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 3`**
