The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `bind - 3`. The rest of the variables, including `s`, `n`, `bind`, and `ind`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `end_colon`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 3`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 3; `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 3`.**
