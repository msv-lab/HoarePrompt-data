#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row, respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; k is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; x is the row number where Sergei sits, and y is the position in that row, such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ m.

If `n` is greater than 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged as there is no else part.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of rows, pupils per row, total questions, and Sergei's position respectively. It calculates and prints the maximum and minimum possible number of questions Sergei can be asked, as well as the actual number of questions he is asked based on his position and the overall questioning pattern. The function handles cases where `n` is equal to 1 or greater than 1 and also considers edge cases related to the number of questions (`k`) that exceed the cycle length. However, the code has a missing functionality where it could lead to errors due to incomplete condition handling and potential off-by-one errors in question counting when `x` is at the boundaries.
