Correctness: **False**

The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for a few reasons:

1. **Calculation of Maximum and Minimum Questions**: The calculation for `min_questions` and `max_questions` in the provided code is incorrect. The logic that derives these values does not account for the right distribution of questions among students as defined by the order of asking. Specifically, the way `min_questions` and `max_questions` are calculated does not correctly reflect the pattern of questioning when the rows are alternated.

2. **Handling Sergei's Position**: The logic to compute how many times Sergei is asked (`sergei_questions`) does not adequately cover all edge cases. For instance, when Sergei is seated at the first or last row (0 or n-1), the program might not correctly increment `sergei_questions` based on the questioning pattern defined in the problem description. The conditionals for updating `sergei_questions` might lead to missing increments in scenarios where `k` is not large enough to fully cover the cycles.

3. **Error in Loop Structure**: The loop that handles `remaining_questions` has inaccuracies in the way it adjusts `row` and handles direction changes. The loop seems to add to `max_questions` but does not correctly account for the boundary conditions, potentially leading to incorrect counts when the teacher alternates between rows.

4. **Off-by-One Errors**: The handling of indices when converting `x` and `y` from 1-based to 0-based can lead to misleading results, particularly if the remaining questions count is not sufficient to traverse all rows as per the defined asking order.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to determine the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's question counts in accordance with the problem description. Thus, it is incorrect.
