The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. The initial state provides that `n` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` is updated based on the expression provided. The previous value of `max_questions` is not known or retained. The states of the other variables (`m`, `k`, `y`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` retains its previous state, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is now equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**
