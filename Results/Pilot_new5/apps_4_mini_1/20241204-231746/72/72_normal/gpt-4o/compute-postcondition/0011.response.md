Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states with `y` being one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`. If `n` is greater than 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged as there is no else part.***
