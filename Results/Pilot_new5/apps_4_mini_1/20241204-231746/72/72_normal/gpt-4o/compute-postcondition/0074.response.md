Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the number of times the loop executed, `row` is either 0 or alternates between 0 and `n-1` depending on the total iterations and direction changes. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Additionally, the current value of `direction` is 1.***
