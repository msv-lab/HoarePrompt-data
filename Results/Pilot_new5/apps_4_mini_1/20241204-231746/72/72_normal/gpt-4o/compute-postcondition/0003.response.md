The value of `full_cycle_length` is assigned based on the condition `n > 1`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` becomes `(2 * n - 2) * m`. Otherwise, it will simply be equal to `m`. Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we will denote that `full_cycle_length` depends on the expression derived from `n` and `m`.

The value of `y` is decreased by 1, but this does not affect `full_cycle_length`. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `y` being decreased, along with the condition for `full_cycle_length`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned specific integers from input; `y` is decreased by 1; `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n <= 1`.**
