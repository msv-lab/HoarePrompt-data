Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `direction` is set to -1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `row` is updated to -1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1 and `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to 1, `col` remains 0, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, and `direction` is set to 1.***
