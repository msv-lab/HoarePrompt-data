Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is one less than its initial value, and `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to `row - 3`. If `direction` does not equal 1 and `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 2`.***
