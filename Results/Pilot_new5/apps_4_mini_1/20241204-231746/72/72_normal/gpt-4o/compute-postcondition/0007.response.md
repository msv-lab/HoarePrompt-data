The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `remaining_questions`, and `min_questions` retain their previous states. The state of `max_questions` is now determined by `full_cycles`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states with `y` being one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`; `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`; `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states with `y` being one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`; `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`; `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
