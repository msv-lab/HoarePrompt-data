Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for several reasons:

1. **Maximum Questions Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `max_asked` as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which does not accurately reflect the maximum number of questions any student can be asked based on the given `k`. The maximum questions asked should depend on how many complete passes (both forward and backward) can be made before the total questions reach `k`.

2. **Minimum Questions Calculation**:
   - The minimum calculation `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` is incorrect. The minimum number of questions any student can be asked depends on how the questions are distributed, and simply subtracting `(n - 1)` from the maximum does not account for the distribution of questions across students.

3. **Sergei's Question Count**:
   - The calculation for `sergei_asked` is also flawed. It utilizes the formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which does not accurately compute how many times Sergei gets asked, particularly because it does not consider the total number of rows and the alternating pattern of asking.

4. **Unused `m` Parameter**:
   - The variable `m` (number of seats per row) is not utilized in any calculations, which indicates that the program does not comprehensively factor in the seating arrangement, although it is crucial for determining how many unique students are present.

In summary, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly reflect the requirements described in the problem statement. The calculations for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` do not appropriately account for the distribution of questions based on both the number of rows (`n`) and the number of questions asked (`k`). Therefore, the program does not fulfill the task as required by the problem description.
