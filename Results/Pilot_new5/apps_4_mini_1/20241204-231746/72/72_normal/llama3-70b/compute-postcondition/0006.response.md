Functionality: ** The function accepts five integer inputs: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of seats per row), `k` (number of questions asked), `x` (the row number where Sergei sits), and `y` (the seat number where Sergei sits). It calculates three values: the maximum number of questions that can be asked (`max_asked`), the minimum number of questions that must be asked (`min_asked`), and the number of questions that Sergei could potentially be asked (`sergei_asked`). These values are printed as output. The function does not return any values. Note that `m` is unused in the calculations.**
