The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers representing the number of rows and seats per row respectively, both of which must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100. The parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked, which can be as large as \(10^{18}\). The parameter `x` is an integer representing the row number where Sergei sits, constrained to be between 1 and `n`. The parameter `y` is an integer representing the seat number where Sergei sits, constrained to be between 1 and `m`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, which respectively represent the number of rows, the number of seats per row, the number of questions asked, and Sergei's row and seat number. It returns an output based on the processing of these parameters.**
