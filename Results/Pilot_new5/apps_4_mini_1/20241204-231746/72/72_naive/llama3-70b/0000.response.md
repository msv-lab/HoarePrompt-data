To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function correctly computes the maximum number of questions a pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a pupil is asked, and how many times Sergei is asked based on the given parameters.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n`: Number of rows.
   - `m`: Number of pupils per row.
   - `k`: Total number of questions asked.
   - `x`: Row number where Sergei sits.
   - `y`: Position in the row where Sergei sits.

2. **Asking Logic**:
   - The teacher starts questioning from the first row to the last row and then backtracks.
   - In the case of a single row (`n == 1`), all questions will be asked to the pupils in that row.
   - The pattern of asking will repeat and the counts will vary based on the number of rows and the total questions.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - **Maximum questions**: The maximum questions asked to any pupil.
   - **Minimum questions**: The minimum questions asked to any pupil.
   - **Sergei's questions**: How many times Sergei is asked.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided attempts to calculate these three values based on the input. 

1. **Maximum Questions** (`max_asked`):
   - The formula calculates how many complete cycles of questions can be asked and distributes the remaining questions.
   
2. **Minimum Questions** (`min_asked`):
   - This ensures that at least one question is asked to every pupil if `max_asked` allows for it. It calculates the minimum by adjusting `max_asked` based on the number of rows.
   
3. **Sergei's Questions** (`sergei_asked`):
   - This formula computes how many times Sergei is asked based on the total questions and his position.

### Potential Issues:
1. The calculation for `min_asked` only considers the row distribution but doesn't explicitly calculate the minimum for edge cases or ensure that the distribution accounts for all pupils correctly.
2. When `k` is less than the number of pupils (`n * m`), the question asking may not evenly distribute, potentially leading to incorrect calculations for `max_asked` and `min_asked`.
3. The logic does not seem to handle the case where `n` is particularly large compared to `k`, which might lead to some pupils being left out entirely.

### Test Cases:
1. For `n = 1`, `m = 3`, `k = 8`, `x = 1`, `y = 1`, we expect:
   - All pupils should receive the same number of questions. The output is (`3, 2, 3`), which follows from the logic.
   
2. For input `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 9`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`, we expect:
   - Each pupil should be asked at least once. The output is (`2, 1, 1`), which aligns with the expected distribution.
   
3. However, testing with edge inputs like `n = 100`, `m = 100`, `k = 1`, `x = 100`, `y = 100` might reveal that not all pupils were asked at least once, which would show a flaw in the logic.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided code does not account for the situation where `k` is insufficient to cover all pupils and may lead to pupils being asked fewer times than expected or not at all, this creates a flaw in the implementation.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for cases where `k < n*m`, indicating that some pupils, depending on their position, might not be asked at all, which contradicts the problem requirements.
