Postcondition: ***`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length h. If the direction is '0', then `current_node` is set to 1. Otherwise, `current_node` is set to 2 and the direction is not equal to '0'.***
