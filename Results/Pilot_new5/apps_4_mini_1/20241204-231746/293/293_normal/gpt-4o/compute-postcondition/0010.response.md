`current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 1`. The previous value of `current_node` is 0, so the new value will be \(2 * 0 + 1 = 1\). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length h, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, and the direction is '0'.
