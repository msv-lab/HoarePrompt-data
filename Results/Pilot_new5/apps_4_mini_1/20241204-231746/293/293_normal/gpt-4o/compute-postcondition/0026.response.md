The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. The parameter `h` is an integer that must be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 2^h inclusive. The function does not explicitly return a value in the given context, so the output behavior is not described. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `h` and `n`, with specific constraints on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, h (an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive) and n (an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive).**
