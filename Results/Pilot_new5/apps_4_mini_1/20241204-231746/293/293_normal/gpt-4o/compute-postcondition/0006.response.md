The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `0`. There are no previous values for `current_node`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 2^h inclusive; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1` in binary form, padded with leading zeros; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0.
