The variable `visited_count` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables (`h`, `n`, and `total_leaves`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive; `total_leaves` is equal to \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 2^h inclusive; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 0.**
