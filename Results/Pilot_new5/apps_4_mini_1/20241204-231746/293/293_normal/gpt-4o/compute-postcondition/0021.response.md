The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 1`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `current_node`, so we cannot determine its new value directly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string of length h with at least 4 characters, `direction` is the fourth character in `path`, and `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`.**
