The code `ans += n // 2 - 1` modifies the variable `ans`. Initially, `ans` is 0, and `n` is an even number greater than 1. The operation `n // 2` computes half of `n`, and then 1 is subtracted from that result before it is added to `ans`.

Since `n` is an even number greater than 1, `n // 2` will yield a positive integer. Specifically, if `n` is 2, then `ans` becomes 0 + (2 // 2 - 1) = 0 + (1 - 1) = 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the value of `ans` will increment further based on the new value of `n`.

However, since `n` is unspecified but guaranteed to be greater than 1 and even, we denote the effect of the operation rather than a specific outcome for `ans`. The state of `h` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an even number greater than 1.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is greater than 1 and even; `ans` is equal to `n // 2 - 1`.**
