The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. The value of `n` is greater than 1, so `n // 2` will be at least 1. The variable `h` remains unchanged as its defined range is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2**.
