The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `n // 2 - 1` to it. The variable `n` is greater than 1. The value of `h` is not affected by this operation. 

Given that `n` is greater than 1, the result of `n // 2 - 1` will always be a non-negative integer (since `n // 2` will be at least 1 for `n = 2`, leading to `n // 2 - 1` being 0). 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` remains unchanged, we do not have a specific numerical value for it, but it is clear that it has been incremented by a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**
