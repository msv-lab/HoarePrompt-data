The function accepts two implicitly read integers, `h` (a positive integer between 1 and 50) and `n` (an integer representing a leaf node index between 1 and 2^h). It calculates an accumulated value `ans` based on the value of `n` through a series of iterations, ultimately printing the result. The value of `ans` is derived from the halving of `n`, accumulating either `n//2 - 1` or `n//2` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively, until `n` reduces to 1. This function does not have a return statement; instead, it outputs the accumulated sum directly to the console.
