To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the program's logic and its alignment with the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
Luba needs to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. The operations she can perform include:
1. Moving the cursor left or right.
2. Closing all tabs to the left of the current cursor position.
3. Closing all tabs to the right of the current cursor position.

The goal is to compute the minimum time (in seconds) needed to close all unwanted tabs.

### Analyzing the Program
The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and reads input directly. Here's how the program handles different scenarios:

1. **All Tabs Open:** If `l == 1` and `r == n`, it prints `0`. This is correct since there are no tabs to close.
   
2. **Closing Right Side:** If `l == 1`, it calculates the time to move to the rightmost tab `r` and close all tabs to the right, which takes `abs(pos - r) + 1`. This is also correct.

3. **Closing Left Side:** If `r == n`, it calculates the time to move to the leftmost tab `l` and close all tabs to the left, yielding `abs(pos - l) + 1`. This is correct.

4. **Both Sides:** The more complex scenario arises when `l > 1` and `r < n`. In this case:
   - It calculates the time to move to the leftmost tab `l` and then closes all tabs left of it. 
   - It calculates the time to move to the rightmost tab `r` and then closes all tabs right of it.
   - It then computes the minimum time to achieve both operations.

   The formula used `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` accounts for:
   - `move_to_l`: time to move to `l`.
   - `move_to_r`: time to move to `r`.
   - `(r - l + 2)`: time to close both sides, accounting for moving and closing.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It considers all possible cases and computes the minimum time required to close the unwanted tabs in each scenario correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
