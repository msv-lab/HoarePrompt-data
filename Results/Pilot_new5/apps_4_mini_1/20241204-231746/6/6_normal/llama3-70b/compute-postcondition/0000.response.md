Since the code snippet involves reading input values for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` from standard input, the values of these variables will be updated based on user input. Other variables remain unaffected, so we will state that the variables have changed based on the provided input.

Since we don’t have specific input values, we denote `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as their respective input values:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an input integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), `r` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ r ≤ n)**.
