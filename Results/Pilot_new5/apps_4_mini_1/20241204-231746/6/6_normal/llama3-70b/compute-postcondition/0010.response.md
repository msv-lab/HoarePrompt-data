The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Here are the definitions of each parameter:

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of tabs, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `pos` is an integer representing the current position of the cursor, constrained such that \(1 \leq pos \leq n\).
- `l` is a positive integer representing the left index of the segment to keep open, constrained such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\).
- `r` is a positive integer representing the right index of the segment to keep open, constrained such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\).

Based on these parameters, the function's output is determined by the following cases:

- **Case 1:** If the current position `pos` is less than `l`, the function returns the number of tabs that need to be closed to the left of `l`.
  
- **Case 2:** If the current position `pos` is greater than `r`, the function returns the number of tabs that need to be closed to the right of `r`.

- **Case 3:** If the current position `pos` is within the range `[l, r]`, the function returns 0, indicating that no tabs need to be closed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters (`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`) and determine how many tabs need to be closed based on the position of the cursor relative to the segment defined by `l` and `r`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, and returns the number of tabs to close based on the current cursor position relative to the specified segment [l, r].**
