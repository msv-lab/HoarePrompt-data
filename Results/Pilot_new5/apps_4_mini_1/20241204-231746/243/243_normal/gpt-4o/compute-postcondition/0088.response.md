Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `m` and performs a binary search to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It returns a list of these integers, specifically the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list. It does not handle cases where `m` is less than 0 or where `zeroes` is less than `m` without finding any valid `n`, leading to an empty result. **
