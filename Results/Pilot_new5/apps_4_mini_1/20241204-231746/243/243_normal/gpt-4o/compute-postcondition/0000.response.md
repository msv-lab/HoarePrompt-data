Initial State: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000.
```
""" Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
```
Now, please think step by step: The code snippet is a comment and doesn't execute any operations or change any variables. Hence, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and no new values are assigned.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000.**
