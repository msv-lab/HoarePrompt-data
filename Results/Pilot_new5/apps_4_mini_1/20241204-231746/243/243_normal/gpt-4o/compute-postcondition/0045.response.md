The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, and the condition for `left` being related to `func_1(left - 1)` still hold. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` must be such that func_1(left - 1) == m - 1.**
