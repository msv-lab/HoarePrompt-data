The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is a positive integer equal to `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is a positive integer equal to `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list.**
