The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which is a specific value derived from the positive integer `m`. Since `low` is initially 0, it will now be equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`. The conditions regarding `zeroes` and `result` remain unchanged. 

The updated output state reflects the new value of `low` while retaining the conditions surrounding the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`; `low` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1**
