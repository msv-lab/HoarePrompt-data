To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue running as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. 

In the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \).
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is calculated as \( (low + high) // 2 \).
- `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is decreased by 1.

Since `left` has just been decreased, we need to ensure that after this decrement, the value of `left` still allows `func_1(left)` to equal `m` for the loop to continue. 

If `left` was originally some integer \( n \), after decrementing, it's now \( n - 1 \). For the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `func_1(n - 1)` still equals \( m \). This means that the function `func_1` must yield the same output for `left` decremented by 1. 

Thus, the adjustment needed is:

- `left` must be such that `func_1(left - 1) == m`. 

We do not need to adjust any other states as `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain consistent with the requirements of the loop condition.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` must be such that func_1(left - 1) == m**
