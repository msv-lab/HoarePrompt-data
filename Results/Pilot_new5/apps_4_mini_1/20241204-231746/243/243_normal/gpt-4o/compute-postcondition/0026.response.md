To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m`, meaning that if `right` remains unchanged, `func_1(right)` could still equal `m`. However, if `right` was already incremented by 1 during the last iteration, we must confirm if `func_1(right)` still equals `m` to ensure the loop can execute again. 

Given the context, since `right` was incremented by 1, we cannot guarantee that `func_1(right)` will still equal `m` without further information about the function `func_1`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` also equals `m` to allow the loop to continue executing. Since the loop has already incremented `right`, `right` must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m` after the increment.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- Keep `left` as it is.
- Ensure that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`, which is not guaranteed currently after the increment.

State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed, `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m, `right` is incremented by 1, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.**
