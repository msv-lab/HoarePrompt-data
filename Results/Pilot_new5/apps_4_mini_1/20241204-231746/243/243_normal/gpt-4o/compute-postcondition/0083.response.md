Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid). If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is set to mid - 1. Otherwise, `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k; `result` is a list containing integers from `((low + high) // 2 - k + 1)` to `((low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) - 1)`; and `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + (n + 1), and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
