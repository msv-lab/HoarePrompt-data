`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The variable `mid` is already defined as (low + high) // 2, so its specific value is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid).**
