According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 2`, and `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `left` must be adjusted such that when it is recalculated, the condition `func_1(left) == m` remains true. Since `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, any adjustment to either `low` or `high` that maintains the condition where `func_1(left)` equals `m` will also ensure that the loop can execute again. 

However, since we do not have the exact details of how `func_1` behaves, we can only state that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`, and `left` can be adjusted to ensure this. 

Given that `low` must remain less than or equal to `high`, there are no specific adjustments needed to `low` and `high` from the current state, as they already satisfy the condition. 

Thus, the primary condition to be maintained is that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 2; and func_1(left) must equal m**
