According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, and we have the conditions based on `zeroes` that influence the updates of `low` and `high`. 

Since there is no direct mention of the values of `low` and `high` at the end of the last iteration, we cannot modify them specifically. However, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the condition `low <= high` continues to hold. This means we need to ensure that after whatever updates occur to `low` and `high`, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high`.

Thus, we can state that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
