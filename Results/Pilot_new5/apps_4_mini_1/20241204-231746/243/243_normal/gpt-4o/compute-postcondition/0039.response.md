The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, but its specific value is not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.**
