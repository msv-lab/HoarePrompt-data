According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` has been decreased by 1, which means `left` now equals the previous value minus 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Thus, we need to ensure that the previous value of `left` (before it was decreased) is such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Since `left` has been decreased by 1, it indicates that `left` must be at least `1` more than the previous value that satisfied `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Since we do not have the specific details of the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot make assumptions about its output. Therefore, we need to state that `left` must be adjusted back to a value where `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m`, which means `left` must be at least `1` greater than what it currently is.

Thus, the adjustment needed is that `left` must be at least `1` greater than its current value after decrement.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
