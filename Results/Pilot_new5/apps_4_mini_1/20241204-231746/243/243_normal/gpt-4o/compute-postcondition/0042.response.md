To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left)` returns exactly `m`.

From the given state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\).
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2\).
- `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` has been decreased by 1.

Since `left` has been decreased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `left` must still yield `func_1(left) == m`. This indicates that the function `func_1` must return `m` when called with the decremented `left` value.

However, since we do not have specific information about how `func_1` behaves or how it relates to `left`, we cannot definitively say what needs to be adjusted—except to ensure that `func_1(left)` will still return `m`. Thus, we will need to ensure that `left` has not decreased to a point where `func_1(left)` can no longer equal `m`.

To satisfy the loop condition, we can state that `left` must be adjusted back to a value that will ensure `func_1(left)` still equals `m`. Hence, we need to set `left` to a value that would yield `func_1(left)` returning `m`.

Given these insights, the output reflecting these adjustments will be:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; left must be adjusted so that func_1(left) equals m**
