The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is a list containing integers from `((low + high) // 2 - k + 1)` to `((low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) - 1)`; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
