Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is recalculated as the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is adjusted to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `result` is a list containing integers from `((low + high) // 2 - k + 1)` to `((low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) - 1)`, and `right` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + (n + 1)`. The most internal loop or if statement is then exited.**
