The value of `zeroes` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1` with `mid` as its argument. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which is a specific value depending on `m`. Therefore, `zeroes` will hold the output of the function based on that specific `mid` value.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `result`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
