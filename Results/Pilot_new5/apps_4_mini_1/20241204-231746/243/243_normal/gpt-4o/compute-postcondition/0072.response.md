Output State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k, where `func_1(left)` must equal m; if func_1(left) does not equal m, the loop terminates; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list.**
