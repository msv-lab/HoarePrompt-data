Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed, `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`; `right` is incremented by 1.**
