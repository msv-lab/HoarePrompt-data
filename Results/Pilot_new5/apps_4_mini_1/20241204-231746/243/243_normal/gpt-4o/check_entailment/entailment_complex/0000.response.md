Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where `m` is such that there are no integers `n` whose factorials end with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The problem description requires the program to return `k`, the count of such integers, followed by the integers themselves, in increasing order. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not account for cases where there are no valid integers that meet the criteria.

In particular, let's consider the case where `m = 5`. As noted in the example provided in the problem description, the output should be `0`, since there are no values of `n` for which `n!` has exactly 5 trailing zeroes. The program returns `0`, but then when it attempts to list the integers, it fails because it does not correctly indicate that no integers exist. It should be returning simply an empty list or handling the output differently in such cases.

Additionally, the binary search mechanism implemented in `func_2` may fail to cover specific edge cases where the trailing zero counts change rapidly due to the number of factors of 5 in the numbers, thus potentially leading to incorrect computations of the ranges for valid `n`.

Thus, since the output does not fulfill the requirements of the problem for all potential cases, and especially fails to correctly handle the case of `m = 5`, the conclusion is that the program is not correct in every scenario outlined in the problem description.
