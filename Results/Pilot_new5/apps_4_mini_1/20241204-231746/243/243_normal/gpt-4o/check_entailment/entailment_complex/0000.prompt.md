You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Annotated Functions:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that n >= 0.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is less than the smallest power of 5 that was considered during the loop (which is 5, 25, 125, ... depending on how many iterations were executed), `count` contains the sum of `n // 5`, `n // 25`, ..., up to the largest power of 5 that was less than or equal to the original value of `n`, and `power_of_5` is the next power of 5 that exceeds the original value of `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns the sum of n // 5, n // 25, ..., up to the largest power of 5 that was less than or equal to the original value of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, which is calculated by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 (i.e., `n // 5`, `n // 25`, etc.) until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative, as it assumes `n` is non-negative based on the initial comment.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the binary search has concluded. If `zeroes` was less than `m`, then `low` is now greater than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` is now less than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` still remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, `result` contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `left` and `right` adjusted based on the counts of zeroes found at those indices. The values of `zeroes`, `mid`, `left`, and `right` are all determined based on the final evaluations leading to the exit of the loop.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result', which contains integers from 'left + 1' to 'right - 1' if 'zeroes' was equal to 'm'. If 'zeroes' was less than or greater than 'm', 'result' remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `m` and performs a binary search to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It returns a list of these integers, specifically the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list. It does not handle cases where `m` is less than 0 or where `zeroes` is less than `m` without finding any valid `n`, leading to an empty result.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
