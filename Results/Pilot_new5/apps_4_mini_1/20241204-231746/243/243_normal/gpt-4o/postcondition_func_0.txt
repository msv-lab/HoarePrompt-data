The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, which is calculated by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 (i.e., `n // 5`, `n // 25`, etc.) until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative, as it assumes `n` is non-negative based on the initial comment.
