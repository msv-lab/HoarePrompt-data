According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely once it starts. Therefore, there are no conditions that prevent the loop from executing at least once. The provided state already allows the loop to proceed without any modifications needed.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1**
