The value of `n` is assigned the value `1`, which is already its initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `n` is 1, and `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000**
