The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` is an empty list `[]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
