The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The values of `ux`, `uy`, `n`, `ops`, and `op` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, `ops` must have at least one element remaining, `op` is the next operation in `ops` (unspecified), and `dx` is decreased by 1.
