Postcondition: ***`ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1, and `dy` remains `y - uy`, both being greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, with `dy` remaining `y - uy`, and both `dx` and `dy` being greater than or equal to 1 and 0 respectively. If `op` is not 'L' or if `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dx` remains `x - ux`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, both being greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is increased by 1.***
