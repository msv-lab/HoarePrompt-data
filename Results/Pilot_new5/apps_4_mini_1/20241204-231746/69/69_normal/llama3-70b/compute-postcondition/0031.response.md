`uy` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `uy` is unknown. The values of `n`, `operations`, and `op` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length greater than 1, `op` is the third character of `operations`, and `uy` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length greater than 1, `op` is the third character of `operations`, `uy` is decreased by 1**
