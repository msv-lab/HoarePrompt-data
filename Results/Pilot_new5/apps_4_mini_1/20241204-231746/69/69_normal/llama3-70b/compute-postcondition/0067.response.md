The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables `ux`, `uy`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, and `res` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, and `res` is incremented by 1.**
