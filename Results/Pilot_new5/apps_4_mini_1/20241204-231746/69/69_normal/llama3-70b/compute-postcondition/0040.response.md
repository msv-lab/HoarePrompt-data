Postcondition: ***`ux` is equal to the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is equal to the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`. The current values are such that either `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0.***
