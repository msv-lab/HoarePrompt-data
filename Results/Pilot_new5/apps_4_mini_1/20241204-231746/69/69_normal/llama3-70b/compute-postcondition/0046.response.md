The variable `dy` is decremented by 1. As per the initial conditions, the current value of `dy` is greater than 0, which means the new value of `dy` will be greater than or equal to 0 after the operation. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to the previous value of `dy` minus 1, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `ops` must have at least one element, `op` is 'U', and the current value of `dy` is now 1 less than it was before.

Output State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to the previous value of `dy` - 1, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `ops` must have at least one element, `op` is 'U', and the current value of `dy` is greater than 0.**
