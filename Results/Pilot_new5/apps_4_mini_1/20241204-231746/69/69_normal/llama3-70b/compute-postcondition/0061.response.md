Postcondition: ***`ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ops` must have at least one element. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1 while `dx` remains equal to `x - ux` and both `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` was less than 0, then `dy` becomes 0 with `dx` still greater than or equal to 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1, while `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` updates to `x - ux + 1` with `dy` remaining equal to `y - uy`. If `op` is not 'L' or if `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dx` remains as `x - ux`, `dy` remains as `y - uy`, both are greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is increased by 1.***
