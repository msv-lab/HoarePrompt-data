The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`ux`, `uy`, `n`, and `ops`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L'; `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D'; `n` is greater than 0; `ops` must have at least one element remaining; `dx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L'; `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D'; `n` is greater than 0; `ops` must have at least one element remaining; `dx` is increased by 1.**
