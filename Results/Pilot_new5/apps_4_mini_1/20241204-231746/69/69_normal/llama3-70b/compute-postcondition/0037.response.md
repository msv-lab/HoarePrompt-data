Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length greater than 1, and `op` is the third character of `operations`. If `op` is 'U', then `ux` is adjusted based on the new `op` and `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `uy` remains adjusted based on the new `op` and `ux` is decreased by 1.***
