To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we must analyze the provided variables and their relationships.

1. The loop iterates over `ops`, which is presumably a list or string. The variable `ops` should be defined and non-empty for the loop to execute at least once. This implies that `n`, the length of `operations`, must be greater than 0.

2. The state of `ux` and `uy` is derived from the counts of specific characters in the `operations` string. While these values can be computed from the `operations`, they need to be valid for the loop to run meaningfully.

3. The variables `dx` and `dy` are calculated as `dx = x - ux` and `dy = y - uy`. For the loop to process correctly, both `dx` and `dy` must be non-negative, which is already stated in the problem.

Thus, to execute the loop, we need to ensure:
- `operations` (or `ops`) must have a length greater than 0.
- Ensure that `ux` and `uy` are calculated correctly from the `operations`.

Given these points, the adjusted state should reflect the necessary conditions:

State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `ops` must have at least one element.**
