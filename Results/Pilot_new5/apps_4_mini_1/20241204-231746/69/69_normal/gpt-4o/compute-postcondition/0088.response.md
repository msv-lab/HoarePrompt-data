Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1; `operations` and `min_length` are updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', `current_y` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `current_x` is updated based on whether the current operation is 'L' (decreasing `current_x` by 1) or not (increasing `current_x` by 1), with similar updates to `operations`, `min_length`, and `position_map`. In all cases, `final_x`, `final_y`, and `target_pos` reflect the final calculated positions based on the operations performed.***
