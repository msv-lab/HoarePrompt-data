Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 1 if `op` is 'U'. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is set to -1; if `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is set to -1 and `final_y` is set to 0; if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is set to 1 and `final_y` is set to 0. The index remains 0, and `op` is not equal to 'U' in the else block.***
