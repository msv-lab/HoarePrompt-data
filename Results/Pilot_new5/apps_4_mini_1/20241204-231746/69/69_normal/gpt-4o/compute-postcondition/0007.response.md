The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. Initially, `final_y` was 0, so after the operation, `final_y` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `op` is not equal to 'U', the index is 0, and the current value of `op` is 'D'.**
