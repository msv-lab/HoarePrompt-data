`final_y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `final_y` is 0, so now `final_y` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, `op` is 'U', and the index is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, `op` is 'U', and the index is 0.**
