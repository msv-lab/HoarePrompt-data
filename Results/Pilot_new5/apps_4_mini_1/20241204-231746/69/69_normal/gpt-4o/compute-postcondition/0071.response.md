The value of `current_x` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`; `current_x` is now equal to `current_x + 1`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`; `current_x` is equal to `current_x + 1`.**
