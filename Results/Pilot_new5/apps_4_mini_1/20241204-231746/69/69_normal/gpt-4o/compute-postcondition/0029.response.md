The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `final_y`, so we cannot specify its exact new value. However, it is noted that `final_y` is updated according to this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `final_x` is based on the second character of `operations`, `final_y` is updated accordingly, `index` is 2 and `final_y` is decreased by 1.
