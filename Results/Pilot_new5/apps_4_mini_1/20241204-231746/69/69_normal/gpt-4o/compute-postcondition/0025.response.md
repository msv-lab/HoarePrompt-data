Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a string of length `n`; `x` is within the range -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9; `y` is within the range -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9. If `op` is 'D', then `final_x` is set based on the second character of `operations`, and `final_y` is set based on the second character of `operations` minus 1, with `index` being 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is set to the second character of `operations` decreased by 1, while `final_y` is set based on the second character of `operations`, with `index` being 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is set to the second character of `operations` plus 1 and `final_y` is set based on the second character of `operations`, with `index` being 1; otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
