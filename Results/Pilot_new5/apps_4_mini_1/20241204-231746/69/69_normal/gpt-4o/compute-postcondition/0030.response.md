The code `final_x -= 1` decreases the value of `final_x` by 1. The variable `final_x` is based on the second character of `operations`, but since we don't have the specific value of `operations`, we cannot determine the exact numeric value of `final_x`. However, we know that `final_x` is being decremented by 1 from its previous value.

The other variables `n`, `operations`, `final_y`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The preconditions that are still valid after the code is executed will include the range for `n`, the length of `operations`, the previous value of `final_y`, and the value of `index`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `final_x` is the previous value of `final_x` decreased by 1, `final_y` is the previous value of `final_y`, `index` is 2.**
