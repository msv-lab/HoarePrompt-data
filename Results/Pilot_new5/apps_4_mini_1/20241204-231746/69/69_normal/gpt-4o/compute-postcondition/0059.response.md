Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`, `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`, if the character at index `i` of `operations` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` of `operations` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1.***
