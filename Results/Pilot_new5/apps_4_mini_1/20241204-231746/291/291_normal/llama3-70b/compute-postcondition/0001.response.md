The value of `n` is a positive integer between `1` and `10^9`. The expression `n.bit_length()` provides the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which ranges from `1` to `30` for values of `n` in this range. Therefore, `n.bit_length() - 1` will yield a value from `0` to `29`. 

When we calculate `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`, the result will range from `2` (when `n` is `1`, as `1.bit_length()` is `1`) to `60` (when `n` is `10^9`, as `10^9.bit_length()` is `30`). 

The function `print()` does not affect the state of the variables; it only outputs the result.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the value of `int(input())` such that `1 <= n <= 10^9; and the output is 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2**
