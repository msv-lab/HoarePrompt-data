The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The function calculates the minimum segments needed based on the formula `min_segments_needed = min(2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a))` for all values of `a` ranging from 1 to `int(sqrt(n))`. After executing the function body, it returns the computed value of `min_segments_needed`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the minimum number of segments needed based on a specific mathematical calculation involving the values of `a` derived from `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the minimum segments needed calculated from the formula involving integer values derived from n.**
