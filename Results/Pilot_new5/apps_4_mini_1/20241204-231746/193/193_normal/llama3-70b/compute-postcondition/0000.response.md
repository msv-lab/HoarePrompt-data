The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on user input, where they are expected to be integers. The constraint states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning `y` will always be less than `x`, and both must be within the specified bounds. The previous states of the variables `x` and `y` are updated directly to reflect the values input by the user.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
