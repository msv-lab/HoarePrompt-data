The program provided does not correctly implement the solution as required by the problem description.

### Explanation:

The problem requires the program to calculate the minimum number of seconds needed to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to one of side length `y`, while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning that the lengths of the sides must always be positive integers and satisfy the triangle inequality).

The provided function does the following:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

1. It reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, which conform to the constraints given (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).
2. It computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)` and prints this value.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds to adjust the sides of the triangle to reach `y`. Simply calculating `abs(x - y)` does not account for the intermediate steps needed to ensure that at no point do the sides of the triangle become non-integer or violate the triangle inequality. 

For example, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`:
- The function would output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output is `4`, as demonstrated in the provided problem example, where the sequence of valid transformations is shown.

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not follow the requirements outlined in the problem description and fails to account for the necessary transformations while adhering to the triangle properties, it does not meet the criteria for correctness.

Correctness: **False**
