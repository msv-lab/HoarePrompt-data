To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we first need to understand the problem description it aims to solve. The task is to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to modify the side length of an equilateral triangle starting from side length `x` to reach side length `y`, ensuring that at no point the triangle becomes degenerate.

### Analysis of the Code:

The program defines a function `func()` that reads two integers `x` and `y`, then calculates the minimum time using the formula:

```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This can be interpreted as:

- `(x - y) // 2`: Computes the number of full side length adjustments where two sides can change simultaneously.
- `(x - y) % 2`: Accounts for any remaining adjustment needed if the difference is odd (i.e., when one last adjustment must be made).

### Examining Edge Cases:

1. **Constraints**: The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which ensures that `x` is always greater than `y` and both are valid triangle side lengths.
2. **Degenerate Triangle Issue**: The program needs to ensure that at no point does the triangle become degenerate (where any side length is zero or negative). The formula should account for the possibility of reducing one side to the length of the other without violating the triangle inequality at intermediate steps.

### Testing Examples:

Now, let's analyze the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **Example 1**: Input `6 3`
   - Steps: `(6,6,6) -> (6,6,3) -> (6,4,3) -> (3,4,3) -> (3,3,3)`
   - Time required: 4 seconds.
   - The calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (This is incorrect).

2. **Example 2**: Input `8 5`
   - Steps: `(8,8,8) -> (8,8,5) -> (8,5,5) -> (5,5,5)`
   - Time required: 3 seconds.
   - The calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (This is incorrect).

3. **Example 3**: Input `22 4`
   - Steps: The example shows multiple steps leading down to `(4,4,4)`.
   - The time required is 6 seconds as per the example.
   - The calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9` (This is incorrect).

### Conclusion:

The output hints state that the function calculates and prints the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. However, upon testing with the provided examples, it is clear that the formula does not yield the correct minimum seconds required in these cases.

The function's approach does not account for the need to sometimes adjust more than two sides or the order of adjustments necessary to prevent reaching a degenerate state. Thus, we have found that this program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**.
