Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcomes is flawed.

1. For the case when `x + z` is equal to `y`, the program prints `'?'`. However, if `z = 0`, the outcome is definitively `'-'`, and if `z > 0`, the outcome could be uncertain. The correct check should be that if `x + z < y`, then the result is `'-'`.

2. Additionally, the program fails to address the case where `x + z > y` correctly. It should check if `x > y + z` to print `'+'`, but it does not account for the fact that if `x + z <= y`, the result could still be uncertain if `z > 0`.

For example, consider the input `0 0 1`. According to the description, this should return `'?'` since the only vote can either be upvote or downvote, leading to two potential outcomes. The program, however, would print `'?'`, which is actually correct, but it indicates a misunderstanding in logic when evaluating votes.

In summary, the program misclassifies certain scenarios, particularly when `x`, `y`, and `z` are involved in combinations that should yield uncertain results but do not align with the expected logic of voting outcomes. Thus, the program fails to always provide the correct output as mandated by the problem description.
