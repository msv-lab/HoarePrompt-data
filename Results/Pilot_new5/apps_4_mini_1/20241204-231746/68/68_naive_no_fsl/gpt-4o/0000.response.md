Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. 

For instance, consider the input `0 0 1`. According to the problem description, if there is one unknown voter (`z=1`), the possible outcomes could be either one upvote or one downvote. Therefore, the result should be uncertain (`?`). 

However, in the provided code, if we input `0 0 1`, the minimum and maximum votes will be calculated as follows:
- `min_upvotes = 0` 
- `max_upvotes = 0 + 1 = 1` 
- `min_downvotes = 0` 
- `max_downvotes = 0 + 1 = 1` 

The logic then evaluates:
- `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` → `1 < 0` (False)
- `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` → `1 < 0` (False)
Since neither condition is satisfied, the program incorrectly outputs `?`, which is appropriate. However, it does not handle the cases where the upvotes can equal the downvotes correctly when there are unknowns.

In particular, for the input `0 0 1`, the correct response should be `?` since we can have either outcome based on the unknown vote, and this is not correctly captured in all cases of the logic implemented in the code.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect.
