To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function and its output for various possible input scenarios.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. If `x` (upvotes) is greater than `y + z` (downvotes plus unknown votes), the output should be "+" indicating more upvotes than downvotes.
2. If `x` is less than `y`, the output should be "-" indicating more downvotes than upvotes.
3. If `x` equals `y`:
   - If `z` is 0, output "0", meaning equal upvotes and downvotes with no unknowns.
   - If `z` is greater than 0, output "?" indicating uncertainty since the unknown votes could potentially change the outcome.
4. Otherwise, the output should be "?" indicating uncertain outcomes when `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`.

### Annotated Program Logic:
- The program correctly checks whether `x` is greater than `y + z`, and if so, it prints '+'.
- It checks if `x` is less than `y` to print '-'.
- It checks if `x` equals `y`:
  - If `z` is 0, it prints '0'.
  - If `z` is greater than 0, it prints '?'.
- Finally, it has a catch-all output of '?' for cases where `x` is greater than `y` but potentially less than or equal to `y + z`.

### Testing Various Inputs:
1. For inputs (3, 7, 0):
   - `x` is not greater than `y + z`, the program will print '-'. **Correct.**
   
2. For inputs (2, 0, 1):
   - `x` is greater than `y + z`, the program will print '+'. **Correct.**
   
3. For inputs (1, 1, 0):
   - `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, so it prints '0'. **Correct.**
   
4. For inputs (0, 0, 1):
   - `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, outputs '?'. **Correct.**

5. For inputs (0, 1, 1):
   - `x` is less than `y`, thus it would print '-'. **Correct.**
  
6. For inputs (2, 2, 2):
   - `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, outputs '?'. **Correct.**

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the logic specified in the problem description for all cases. It handles the comparisons and conditions accurately, providing the expected results based on the analysis.

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
