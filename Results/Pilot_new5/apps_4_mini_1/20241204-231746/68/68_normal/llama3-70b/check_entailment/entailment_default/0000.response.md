Let's assess the provided Python program in light of the problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem states that we need to determine the voting outcome based on the counts of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). The conditions for the output are well-defined:
1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes plus unknowns (`x > y + z`), the output should be "+".
2. If downvotes are greater than upvotes (`x < y`), the output should be "-".
3. If upvotes equal downvotes (`x == y`), we differentiate based on `z`:
   - If `z` is 0, output "0".
   - If `z` is greater than 0, output "?".
4. Any situation where upvotes are greater than or equal to downvotes but not equal should also result in "?" to indicate uncertainty due to unknown voters.

### Program Review:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The code checks the conditions in the correct logical order.
- It accurately takes into account the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes.
- The output options are correctly handled based on the voting conditions.

#### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Case where `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `z` is 1**:
   - According to the problem description, this should result in "?" because there is uncertainty whether the one unknown vote is an upvote or a downvote.
   - The code correctly handles this scenario by falling into the last `else` case (since `x == y` and `z > 0`).
2. **Case where `x` is 0, `y` is 1, and `z` is 0**:
   - The output should be "-" since downvotes outnumber upvotes, and this is correctly handled by the code.
3. **Case where `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and `z` is 1**:
   - Should output "?" since the result is uncertain.
   - The code handles this by falling into the appropriate branch as well.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints provide a concise explanation of the code's behavior:
- They clarify how the function interprets conditions for each output case. 
- The hints correctly state that the function prints "+" if `x` is greater than `y + z`, "-" if `x` is less than `y`, "0" if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, and "?" under the other circumstances.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the function appears to cover all scenarios correctly. All outputs align with the expectations set by the problem description and the output hints.

Correctness: **True**.
