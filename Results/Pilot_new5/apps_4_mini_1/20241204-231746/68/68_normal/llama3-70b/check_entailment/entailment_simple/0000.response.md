To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program to see if it correctly handles the different scenarios described.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Vote Outcome**:
   - The first check `if (x > y + z)`:
     - This condition checks if the number of upvotes is greater than the maximum possible downvotes (which would occur if all unknown voters upvoted). If true, it prints `'+'`, indicating a definite majority of upvotes.
   - The second check `if (x < y)`:
     - This checks if the upvotes are fewer than the downvotes. If true, it prints `'-'`, indicating a definite majority of downvotes.
   - The third condition `if (x == y)`:
     - This implies that upvotes equal downvotes. Here, the program checks:
       - `if (z == 0)`: If there are no unknown votes, it prints `'0'`, indicating a tie.
       - If `z > 0`, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty because the unknown votes could sway the result either way.
   - The final `else` prints `'?'` when `x` is not equal to `y`, indicating there is still uncertainty based on the unknown votes.

### Summary of Cases:
- When `x > y + z`: Output is `'+'` (certain upvote majority).
- When `x < y`: Output is `'-'` (certain downvote majority).
- When `x == y`:
  - If `z == 0`: Output is `'0'` (exact tie).
  - If `z > 0`: Output is `'?'` (uncertain due to unknown votes).
- When `x < y` or `x > y + z`: The program correctly identifies this state.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, as it accounts for all possible outcomes based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
