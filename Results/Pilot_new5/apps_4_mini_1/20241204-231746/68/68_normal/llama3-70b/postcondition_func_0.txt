The function accepts three integer inputs x, y, and z (all between 0 and 100) and prints a character based on their values: it prints '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, '?' if x equals y and z is greater than 0, and '?' if x is greater than or equal to y but not equal to it. The function does not return any values.
