The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which was initially an integer within the range of 0 to 100. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `min_upvotes` while maintaining the range of the other variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
