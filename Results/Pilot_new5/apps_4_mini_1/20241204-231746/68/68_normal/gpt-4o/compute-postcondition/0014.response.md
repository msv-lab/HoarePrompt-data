The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It relies on the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers constrained between 0 and 100 (inclusive). The functionality of the function will depend on the specific logic implemented within the function body, which is not provided in this case. Therefore, without additional information on the output for various conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, it is not possible to determine the exact return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on the internal logic involving the integers x, y, and z, which are constrained between 0 and 100.**
