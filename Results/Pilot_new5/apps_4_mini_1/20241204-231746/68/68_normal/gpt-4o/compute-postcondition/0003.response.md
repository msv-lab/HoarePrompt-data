The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y`, which is an integer in the range 0 to 100. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
