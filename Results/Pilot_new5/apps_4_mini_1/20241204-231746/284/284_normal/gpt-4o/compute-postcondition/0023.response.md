To analyze the output state after the while loop executes, we need to take into account the conditions and changes made to the variables within the loop.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000.
   - `x` is greater than 3, and it is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3.
   - `i` is initially 5.

2. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`.
   - Inside the loop, if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns False and the loop terminates.
   - After each loop iteration, `i` is incremented by 6, moving to the next potential odd factor.

**Output State Analysis**:
- After the loop executes, the following conditions are true:
  - If the loop exits because `i * i > x`, it indicates that all potential odd factors have been checked up to the square root of `x`. Therefore, `i` will be greater than the square root of `x`.
  - If the loop exited due to `x` being divisible by either `i` or `i + 2`, then the function would have returned False, indicating `x` is not prime.

- Given that `n` is a constraint, it does not change during the execution of the loop.

- The value of `x` remains unchanged through the iterations but must satisfy the conditions outlined at the loop's beginning.

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`i` is greater than the square root of `x`, `x` is original and unaltered, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, and if the loop terminated without returning False, `x` is a prime number greater than 3 that is not divisible by 2 or 3.**
