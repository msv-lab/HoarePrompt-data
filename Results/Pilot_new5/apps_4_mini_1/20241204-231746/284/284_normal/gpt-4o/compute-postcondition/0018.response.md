The code increments the value of `i` by 6. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is increased by 6. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 121 and 25, and is neither divisible by 5 nor 7; `i` is increased by 6.**
