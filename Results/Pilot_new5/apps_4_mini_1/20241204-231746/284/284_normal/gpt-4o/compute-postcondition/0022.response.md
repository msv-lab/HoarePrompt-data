The value of `i` is incremented by 6, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The conditions regarding `n` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 6) * (i + 6); and if either `x` is divisible by `i` or `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, the program returns False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 6) * (i + 6); and if either `x` is divisible by `i` or `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, the program returns False; `i` is increased by 6.**
