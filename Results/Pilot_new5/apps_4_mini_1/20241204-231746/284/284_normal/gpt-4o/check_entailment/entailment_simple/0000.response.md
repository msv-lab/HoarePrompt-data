To determine if the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, let's break down the functionality of the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a positive integer `n`, which is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 1000. This meets the input requirements specified in the problem.

2. **Loop and Counterexample Search**: The program iterates over `m` from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.

3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function checks if the number `x` (which is `n * m + 1`) is less than or equal to 1 (returns False).
   - If `x` is 2 or 3, it returns True (indicating that these are prime).
   - It eliminates even numbers and multiples of 3, returning False for those.
   - For numbers greater than 3 that are not even or multiples of 3, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1`, which is a standard method for checking primality and is efficient.

4. **Finding a Counterexample**: The program aims to find at least one `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, and it prints that `m`. The problem guarantees that such an `m` exists for any valid `n`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis:
- It begins by validly reading the input and iterates through possible values of `m`.
- It accurately evaluates the primality of `n * m + 1` using `func_1`.
- The output of `m` will be a valid counterexample since the problem guarantees that for every `n`, there exists at least one `m` such that `n * m + 1` is composite.

### Conclusion:
Since the program adheres strictly to the requirements of the problem description and correctly implements the search for a counterexample to PolandBall’s hypothesis within the specified constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
