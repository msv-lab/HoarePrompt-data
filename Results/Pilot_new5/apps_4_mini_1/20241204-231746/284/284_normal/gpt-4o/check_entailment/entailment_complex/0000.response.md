To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze how the program attempts to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis regarding prime numbers.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Loop through `m`**: The program iterates `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Checking Function (`func_1`)**: The function checks if `n * m + 1` is a prime number. If it is not prime, the function prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Prime Checking Function Logic
- The function `func_1(x)` correctly implements checks for the primality of `x`:
  - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
  - It returns `True` for 2 and 3.
  - It returns `False` for even numbers greater than 2 and numbers divisible by 3.
  - It employs a loop to check for divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `x`.

### Ensuring Correctness
To ensure that the program meets the problem requirements, we consider if it can find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is guaranteed to be not prime:
- **For each `m`**: The program checks if `n * m + 1` is prime.
- Given that the output states that there exists such an `m`, the loop will always find at least one `m` within the range of 1 to 1000 that satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion
The program can indeed find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, as guaranteed by the problem statement. The checks within `func_1` ensure that any composite number (non-prime) encountered will cause the program to print that value of `m`.

### Final Statement
Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the requirements of the problem description and successfully identifies a counterexample to the hypothesis for valid inputs.
