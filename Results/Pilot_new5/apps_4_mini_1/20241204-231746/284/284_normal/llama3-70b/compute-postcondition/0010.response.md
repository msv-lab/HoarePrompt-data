To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop statement and the provided state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):`, which means that `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 
2. The given state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `num` is a positive integer with specific properties, and it is noted that `num % i == 0` evaluates to False, which suggests that `i` is not a factor of `num`.

Since the loop control variable `i` starts from 2 and increments up to `int(num ** 0.5)`, we need to establish what the current value of `i` was at the end of the last iteration and what it will be at the beginning of the next iteration.

- If the loop has executed without returning False, it implies that `i` was less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)` at the end of the last iteration.
- To execute again, `i` will increment by 1.

Given that `num` is between 4 and 1000 and is not divisible by 3, we can conclude the following:

- The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The upper limit for `i` is `int(num ** 0.5)`. 
- For the loop to continue executing, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Thus, the next state should reflect the incremented value of `i` while ensuring it is still within the bounds set by `num`.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and is not divisible by 3, `i` is incremented by 1, specifically `i + 1`, and must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`**
