The provided program attempts to find a counterexample for the hypothesis stated by PolandBall, which requires finding a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. 

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) which is within the range from 1 to 1000.

2. **Loop through possible values of \( m \)**: 
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.

3. **Prime Checking Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function checks if a number \( num \) is prime. 
   - It returns `False` if \( num < 2 \).
   - For numbers \( num \geq 2 \), it checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( num \).

4. **Logic to find a suitable \( m \)**: 
   - Inside the loop, it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime using the `func_1` function.
   - If \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

### Verification of the Program Against the Problem Description

The program is designed to output a value of \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. 

- The use of the prime-checking function is accurate and appropriately captures the essence of identifying prime numbers.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop ensures that once a suitable \( m \) is found, the program terminates correctly.

### Conclusion

The program adheres strictly to the requirements laid out in the problem description. It guarantees that for any given \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1000), it will find and output a corresponding \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, demonstrating that PolandBall's hypothesis can be disproved.

Correctness: **True**
