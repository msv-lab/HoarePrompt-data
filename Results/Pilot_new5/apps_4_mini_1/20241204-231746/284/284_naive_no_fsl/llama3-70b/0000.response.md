To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that for a given positive integer `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, and the output should satisfy `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`.

### Program Breakdown
1. The program reads an integer `n`.
2. It runs a loop for `m` from `1` to `1000`.
3. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`.
4. It checks if `n * m + 1` is not a prime using the function `func_1`.
5. If it finds such an `m`, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### The Prime Checking Function `func_1`
- It returns `False` if the number is less than `2`.
- It checks if the number can be divided by any integer from `2` up to its square root. If it finds such a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that it is prime.

### Analyzing Possible Cases
1. **Basic Cases**: For `n = 1`, the output would be `m = 1` since `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime). But for `m = 2`, `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (also prime). The program does not print anything if all values are prime.
2. As `n` increases, there will be many values of `m` where `n * m + 1` can be composite. However, there may exist cases where all checked values up to `1000` yield primes.

### Counterexample Discovery
Let's consider:
- If `n` is a prime number itself, for small values like `n = 2`, `n = 3`, `n = 5`, `n = 7`. If `m` spans from 1 to 1000, all forms of `n * m + 1` can still potentially yield primes since increasing `m` would yield larger odd numbers (considering `n` is odd).

### Conclusion
While the program intends to find a non-prime result for any valid input, it may fail for certain values of `n`, especially primes themselves or specific combinations where the resulting expressions always yield primes (though less likely). 

The logic could miss printing a valid `m` in cases where no composite number is found in the given range, which contradicts the problem's guarantee that a solution exists.

Therefore, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: The program could potentially not find a suitable `m` for certain inputs where all values of `n * m + 1` remain prime within the checked range, leading to no output being printed despite a valid result being required.
