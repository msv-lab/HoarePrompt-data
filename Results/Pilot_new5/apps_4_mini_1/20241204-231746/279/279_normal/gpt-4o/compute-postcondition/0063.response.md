The variable `no_reverse_components` is assigned the value of the sum of a generator expression that checks each cycle in the `cycles` list. For each cycle, it counts how many elements in that cycle correspond to a `0` in the list `b`. The preconditions indicate that `n` is a positive integer and `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values. The state of `cycles` and `b` will be reflected based on their contents as they are used in the computation but remain unchanged by the code itself.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values, `cycles` is a list of lists containing all the cycles identified in the permutation described by `p`, `no_reverse_components` is the sum of the counts of cycles where all corresponding values in `b` are 0.**
