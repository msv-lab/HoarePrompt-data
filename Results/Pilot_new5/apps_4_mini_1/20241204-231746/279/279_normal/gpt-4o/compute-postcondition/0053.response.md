`cycle` now includes the value of `x`, which is `p[2] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[2]` is True, `visited[x]` is True (where `x` is `p[2] - 1`), `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current cycle which now includes 2, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, `p[2]` is greater than 2, and `cycle` now includes `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[2]` is True, `visited[x]` is True (where `x` is `p[2] - 1`), `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current cycle which now includes 2, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, `p[2]` is greater than 2, and `cycle` now includes `x`.**
