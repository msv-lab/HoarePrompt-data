In this case, `p` is assigned the value obtained by mapping the elements of the `data` list from index `1` to `n + 1` into integers. The value of `n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input. Therefore, the values of `p` will change according to the integers present in the specified range of `data`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, after executing the code, the new value of `p` will be a list of integers derived from the elements in `data[1]` to `data[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `b` is a list of integers of length n consisting of 0s and 1s, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[1:n + 1]`.**
