The statement `visited[x] = True` sets the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. We know that `x` is defined as `p[1] - 1`. Since `p[1]` must be greater than or equal to 3, it follows that `x` will be at least `2` (because the minimum value for `p[1]` is 3, making `x = 3 - 1 = 2`). Therefore, `visited[2]`, which was initially `False`, will now become `True`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State reflects the updated value for `visited[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p[1]` must be greater than or equal to 3, `visited[2]` is True, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle` which is now `[1]`, `x` is `p[1] - 1`**.
