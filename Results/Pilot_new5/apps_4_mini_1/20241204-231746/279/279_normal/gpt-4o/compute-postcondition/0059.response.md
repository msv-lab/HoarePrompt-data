Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` contains `True` for all indices that were reached during the loop, including index 2 and the indices corresponding to the values in `p` that were traversed, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current cycle which now contains all the indices visited during this loop, `x` is the value that corresponds to the last index visited (which is `p[x] - 1` for the last valid `x` before the loop terminated).**
