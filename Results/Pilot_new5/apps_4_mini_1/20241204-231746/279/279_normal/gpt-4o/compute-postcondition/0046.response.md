`x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle`, which is now an empty list, and `x` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle`, which is now an empty list, and `x` is 2.**
