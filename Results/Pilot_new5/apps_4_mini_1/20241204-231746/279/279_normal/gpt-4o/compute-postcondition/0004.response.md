The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the slice of the `data` list from `data[n + 1]` to `data[2 * n + 1]`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `b` is a list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s, the new `b` will contain the integers converted from that slice of `data`. The previous value of `b` is not known, but it is updated to reflect the new values from `data`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[1:n + 1]`, `b` is a list of integers containing the values from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` converted to integers.**
