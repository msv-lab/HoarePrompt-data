The value of `x` is appended to the `cycle` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The output will reflect that the `cycle` list now contains the previously existing values along with the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list with the first value `True` and the value at index `x` is `True`, other values are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing 0 and `x`, `x` is greater than 0.**
