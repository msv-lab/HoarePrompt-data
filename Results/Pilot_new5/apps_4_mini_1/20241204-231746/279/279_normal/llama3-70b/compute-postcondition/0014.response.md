Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. 

The provided code snippet `ans += 1` indicates that `ans` will be incremented by 1 regardless of the condition mentioned earlier, as it does not check the state of `p[i]`.

As a result, `ans` increases by 1.

Since `i` remains equal to `n`, `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the increment in `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
