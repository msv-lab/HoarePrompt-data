The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It counts the number of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` (indicating that the permutation is not in its natural order at that index) and the number of indices `i` where `b[i]` is equal to 0. The sum of these counts is stored in the variable `ans`, which is then printed as the output. 

The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Therefore, it effectively counts and reports how many discrepancies exist in the permutation relative to the expected order, combined with how many zeros are in the list `b`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` containing zeros and ones. It counts how many elements in `p` are not in their expected position and how many elements in `b` are zeros, and prints the total count. **
