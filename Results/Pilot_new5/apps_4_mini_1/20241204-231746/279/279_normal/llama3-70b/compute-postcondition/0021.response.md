Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is equal to 0, across all indices from 0 to n-1.**
