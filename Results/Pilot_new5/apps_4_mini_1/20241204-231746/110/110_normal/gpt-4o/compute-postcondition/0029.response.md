The code `total_coverage -= cov` updates the value of `total_coverage` by subtracting the value of `cov` from it. The initial state indicates that `total_coverage` is 0, and `cov`, `x`, `y` were assigned values from the popped element of the heap, but the specific value of `cov` is unknown. Therefore, the new value of `total_coverage` will be negative, specifically `-cov`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_coverage`.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `total_coverage` is -cov, loop counter is 0, `cov`, `x`, `y` are assigned the values from the popped element of the heap.**
