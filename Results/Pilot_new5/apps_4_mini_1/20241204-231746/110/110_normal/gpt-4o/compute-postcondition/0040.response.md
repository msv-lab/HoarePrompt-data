Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters: `n` and `m` which define the dimensions of a pond, `r` which defines the size of a scoop-net, and `k` which specifies the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond. The function calculates the total coverage based on the highest `k` coverage values from all positions in the pond and divides this total coverage by the number of valid positions for placing the scoop-net, which is determined by the formula `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If `k` is greater than the number of positions with coverage values in the heap, the function will only sum available values. The function returns the average coverage per valid position, while potential edge cases involving negative or zero values for `total_positions` are not explicitly handled.**
