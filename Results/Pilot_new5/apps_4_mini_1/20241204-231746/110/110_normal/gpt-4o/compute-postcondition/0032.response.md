The value of `total_coverage` is decreased by `cov`. Since `total_coverage` is initially `-cov`, after the execution of the code, it will now be `-cov - cov`, which simplifies to `-2 * cov`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `total_coverage` is -2 * `cov`, loop counter is 1, `cov`, `x`, `y` are updated to the values from the popped element of the heap.
