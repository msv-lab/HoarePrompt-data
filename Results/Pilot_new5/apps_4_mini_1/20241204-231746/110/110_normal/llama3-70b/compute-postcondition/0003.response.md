The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. Each of these parameters is an integer with the following constraints: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)`. 

The function does not have a specified output in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot ascertain the specific return values or conditions based on the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters: n, m, r, and k, with specified constraints on their values.**
