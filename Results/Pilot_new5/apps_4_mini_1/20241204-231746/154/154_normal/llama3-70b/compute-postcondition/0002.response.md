The `t.sort()` method sorts the list `t` in place. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged, but the order of the integers in the list `t` will be altered to be in ascending order. Therefore, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `M` retain their input values, the list `t` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (new value from input), `k` is an integer (new value from input), `M` is a non-negative integer (new value from input), `t` is a sorted list of k integers.**
