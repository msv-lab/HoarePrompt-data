According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to M (inclusive). The execution of the loop depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, we are given `j` is the last value it took in the loop, which is `M` since the loop is structured as `for j in range(1, M + 1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1. However, since `j` can take values only from 1 to M, and it has reached M, the next value of `j` would be `M + 1`, which is outside the defined range for the loop.

Thus, the loop cannot execute again because it has already reached its maximum limit defined by M.

The state remains unchanged in this case because the loop will not be able to run any more iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is M + 1**
