Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, and `dp` is a list of `k + 1` lists each containing `M + 1` zeros. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, `dp[1][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`.***
