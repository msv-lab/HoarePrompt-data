The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variables that are impacted by this statement are `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. 

Given that `j` is equal to `M + 1`, the assignment means that `dp[i][M + 1]` will take the value of `dp[i][M]`. However, the specifics of `i` are not defined in the initial state; it can take any value within the bounds of the `dp` array.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the updated output state reflects the change in `dp` values while retaining the other preconditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[k + 1][2]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][1]`, `j` is `M + 1`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][M]`**.
