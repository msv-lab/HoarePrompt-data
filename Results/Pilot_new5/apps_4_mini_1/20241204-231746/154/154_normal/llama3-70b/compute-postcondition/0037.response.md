Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `t` at index `i - 1` (i.e., `j >= t[i - 1])***
