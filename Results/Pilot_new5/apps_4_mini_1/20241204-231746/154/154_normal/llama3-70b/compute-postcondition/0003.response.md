The variable `dp` is assigned a list comprehension that creates a list of lists. Each sublist contains `M + 1` zeros, and there are `k + 1` such sublists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are not affected, but `dp` now becomes a list of lists structured as described. 

The output state updates only the variable `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (new value from input), `k` is an integer (new value from input), `M` is a non-negative integer (new value from input), `t` is a sorted list of k integers, and `dp` is a list of k + 1 lists, each containing M + 1 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (new value from input), `k` is an integer (new value from input), `M` is a non-negative integer (new value from input), `t` is a sorted list of k integers, `dp` is a list of k + 1 lists, each containing M + 1 zeros.**
