According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. Since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `M`, the next value of `j` will be 2. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop's progression.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
