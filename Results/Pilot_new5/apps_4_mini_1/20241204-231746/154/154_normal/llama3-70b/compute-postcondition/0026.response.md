In the provided code snippet, `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The variables `i` and `j` have specific values of `k + 1` and `2`, respectively. The impact of this assignment means that `dp[k + 1][2]` is updated to hold the value that was previously stored in `dp[k + 1][1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[k + 1][2]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[k + 1][2]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][1]**
