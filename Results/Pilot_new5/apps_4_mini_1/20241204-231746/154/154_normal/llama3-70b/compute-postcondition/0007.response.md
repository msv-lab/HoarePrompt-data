Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` is a list of `k + 1` lists each containing `M + 1` zeros, `i` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]` for `j > 0`, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.***
