The variables `n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which are converted to integers. The list `t` remains unchanged during this operation. The new values for `n`, `k`, and `M` will depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (new value from input), `k` is an integer (new value from input), `M` is a non-negative integer (new value from input), `t` is a list of k integers where each t[j] (1 ≤ j ≤ k) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000.**
