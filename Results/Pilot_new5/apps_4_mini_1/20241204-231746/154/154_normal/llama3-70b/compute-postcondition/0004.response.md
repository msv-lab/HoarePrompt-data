According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts at 1 and goes to `k + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should also start from 1 at the beginning of the first iteration, as the loop iterates from 1 to `k`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `i` is initialized to 1

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a sorted list of k integers, `dp` is a list of k + 1 lists each containing M + 1 zeros, `i` is 1**
