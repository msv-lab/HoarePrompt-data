The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, and `j` is `M + 1`. 

Since `j` is `M + 1`, we can deduce that the assignment is effectively populating `dp[i][M + 1]` with the value of `dp[i][M]`. This operation does not alter any of the other variables, but it updates the `dp` array at the specified index.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is M + 1, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][M]`.**
