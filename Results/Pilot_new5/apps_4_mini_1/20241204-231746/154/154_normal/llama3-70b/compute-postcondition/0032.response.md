Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[k + 1][2]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][1]`, `j` is `M + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.***
