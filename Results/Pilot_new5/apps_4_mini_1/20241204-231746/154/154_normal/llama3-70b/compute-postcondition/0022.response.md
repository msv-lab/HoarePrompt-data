Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` remains updated with `dp[k + 1][j]` being equal to `dp[k + 1][j - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the element `t[i - 1]` in the sorted list `t`.***
