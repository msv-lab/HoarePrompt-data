#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9; t is a list of k integers where each t[j] (1 ≤ j ≤ k) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` has been fully updated such that `dp[k][j]` represents the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items with a total weight of `j` for all `j` from 0 to `M`, `dp[i][0]` remains 0 for all `i`, and `dp[0][j]` remains 0 for all `j`.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers, `n`, `k`, and `M`, as well as a list `t` of `k` integers. It calculates the maximum number of items that can be selected from the given items in `t` without exceeding the total weight `M`. The function outputs the sum of the maximum number of items that can be selected for each `M` value, along with the count of instances where the maximum number of items matches the number of items selected. However, it does not directly use the parameter `n`, which may indicate a lack of usage or expected functionality in the computation.
