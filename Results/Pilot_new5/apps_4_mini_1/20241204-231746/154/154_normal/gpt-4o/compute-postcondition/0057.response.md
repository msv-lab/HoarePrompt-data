The code executes a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most immediate loop or conditional statement it is currently within. Since no variables are being modified by this statement, the values of the existing variables will remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables as they were before, with the added note that we have exited the loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k)`; `remaining_time` remains unchanged; `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`; `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`; `max_points` is updated to `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
