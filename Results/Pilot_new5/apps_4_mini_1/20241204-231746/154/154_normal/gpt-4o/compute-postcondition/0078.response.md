Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 45. `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved given the available `remaining_time` and `t`, and `remaining_time` is the time left after attempting to solve the maximum possible number of subtasks for each `subtask_time` in `t`. If the loop does not execute (when `remaining_time` is less than the smallest `subtask_time` in `t`), then `remaining_time` remains unchanged, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
