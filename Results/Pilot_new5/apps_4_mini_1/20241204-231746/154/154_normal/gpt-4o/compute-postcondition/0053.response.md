Subtasks solved is updated based on the minimum of the current subtasks solved and the maximum subtasks that can still be completed given the remaining capacity. The expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k` determines how many more subtasks can be solved. If `subtasks_solved` was previously greater than this value, it will be adjusted down to this new limit. The states of the other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, `remaining_time` remains unchanged, `complete_tasks` increases by 1, `time_used` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, `remaining_time` remains unchanged, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`.**
