Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtasks_solved` is equal to the total number of subtasks solved across all iterations, `remaining_time` is the time left after attempting to solve as many subtasks as possible with the given `t` values, `complete_tasks` remains updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, and `points` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1). If no subtasks can be solved due to insufficient remaining_time for all `subtask_time` values in `t`, then `subtasks_solved` would be 0 and `remaining_time` would remain as originally calculated.**
