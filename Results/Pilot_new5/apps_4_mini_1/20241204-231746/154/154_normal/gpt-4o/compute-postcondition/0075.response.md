Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 45; `remaining_time` is still greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
