The variable `points` is assigned the value equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The initial state indicates that `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1` before this assignment takes place. Therefore, after the increment, `points` will be equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` where `complete_tasks` has been updated to `complete_tasks + 1.**
