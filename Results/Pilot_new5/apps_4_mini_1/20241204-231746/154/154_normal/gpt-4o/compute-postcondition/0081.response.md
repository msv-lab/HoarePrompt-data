Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is the maximum points achievable given the constraints; if the loop does not execute, `max_points` remains 0.**
