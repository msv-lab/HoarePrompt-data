Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; if `time_used` is greater than `M`, then `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k)`, `remaining_time` remains unchanged, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`, and `max_points` is updated to `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
