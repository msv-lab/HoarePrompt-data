The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The values of `remaining_time` and `subtask_time` are specified such that `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `t[j]`, meaning both variables are valid for this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is 0; `time_used` is 0; `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `t[j]`; `subtask_time` is equal to `t[j]` for the next index; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
