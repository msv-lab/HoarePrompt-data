Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, and `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
