The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is a positive integer that must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer that must satisfy the constraint \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, where each integer \(t[j]\) must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq t[j] \leq 1000000\).

After executing the function body, the program returns `max_points`, which represents the maximum points achievable given the constraints, where `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`. If the loop does not execute, `max_points` remains 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), k (positive integer), M (non-negative integer), and t (list of k positive integers), and returns max_points, the maximum points achievable based on the constraints. If no calculations are made, it returns 0.**
