Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, `points` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is equal to M - (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` is a list containing at least one element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`**.
