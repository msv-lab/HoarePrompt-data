Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads inputs for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` of subtask times, which are all defined according to the problem description.

2. **Calculation of Total Time per Task**:
   - The program calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks of a task using `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`. This is required since completing a task provides additional points.

3. **Loop through Complete Tasks**:
   - The outer loop (`for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):`) iterates through the number of tasks Polycarp can completely solve (from 0 to `n`). This adheres to the requirement that he can solve a maximum of `n` tasks.

4. **Points Calculation**:
   - For each number of complete tasks, the program calculates the points earned from those tasks (`points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`). This is consistent with the problem statement that states a complete task earns `k + 1` points.

5. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**:
   - The program then computes the remaining time after the complete tasks are accounted for (`remaining_time = M - time_used`). It attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible within this remaining time.
   - The inner loop iterates over each subtask time and calculates how many subtasks can be solved using the remaining time (`max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time`). This ensures that it makes optimal use of the remaining time across different tasks.

6. **Limiting Subtask Completion**:
   - The code correctly limits the number of subtasks solved by ensuring it does not exceed the number of remaining tasks (`subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`), which adheres to the problem's constraints.

7. **Max Points Calculation**:
   - The program updates the maximum points achievable in each iteration of the outer loop, ensuring that it considers the best outcome across all possible combinations of complete and partial task completions.

In conclusion, the program logically follows the constraints and requirements set out in the problem description, ensuring an accurate calculation of the maximum points Polycarp can earn based on the subtasks and complete tasks within the given time limit. Therefore, the program is correct.
