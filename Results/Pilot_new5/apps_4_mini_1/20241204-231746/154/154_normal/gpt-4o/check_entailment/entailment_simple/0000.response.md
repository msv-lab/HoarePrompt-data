To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and flow of the program.

The problem asks us to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn given:
- `n`, the number of tasks.
- `k`, the number of subtasks per task.
- `M`, the total time available in minutes.
- `t`, a list of integers representing the time required to solve each subtask.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads input values for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` which contains `k` time values.
2. It calculates the total time required to completely solve one task (`total_time_per_task`), which is the sum of the time required for all subtasks.
3. It iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can solve from 0 to `n`.
4. For each count of complete tasks, it checks if there is enough time to solve these tasks. If not, it breaks out of the loop.
5. It calculates how many points are earned from solving the complete tasks.
6. It calculates the remaining time after solving complete tasks and attempts to maximize the number of subtasks solved with the remaining time.
7. It ensures that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the number of available subtasks from non-complete tasks.
8. Finally, it updates the maximum points obtained and returns that value.

**Analysis of Correctness:**
- The program correctly iterates through the number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`.
- The calculation of `points` for complete tasks is correct, as it adds an extra point for each completed task.
- The program handles the remaining time correctly, trying to maximize the number of subtasks solved with it.
- The consideration of not exceeding the available subtasks from incomplete tasks is also correctly implemented.

**Edge Cases:**
- If `M` is 0, it correctly returns 0 points since no tasks can be solved.
- It accommodates scenarios where not many subtasks can be solved due to high time requirements.

Given these observations, the program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description for all possible input cases specified.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
