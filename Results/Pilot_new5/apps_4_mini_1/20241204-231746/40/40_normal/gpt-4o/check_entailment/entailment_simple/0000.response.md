To determine whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and flow of the code against the expected behavior defined in the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. We need to find the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome.
2. If all substrings of `s` are palindromes, the output should be `0`.
3. If `s` itself is not a palindrome, the output should be the length of `s`.
4. If removing the first character or the last character makes it a non-palindrome, the output should be the length of the string minus one.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The first line of the input is read and stripped of whitespace.
2. **Length Check**: If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, it correctly returns `0` since a single character or empty string can't have non-palindrome substrings.
3. **Palindrome Checks**: The program uses the helper function `func_1` to check if the string or its substrings are palindromes:
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s)`.
   - If the substring `s[1:]` (which removes the first character) is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1`.
   - If the substring `s[:-1]` (which removes the last character) is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1`.
4. **Final Case**: If all checks fail and `s`, `s[1:]`, and `s[:-1]` are all palindromes, it correctly outputs `0`.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program accurately implements the logic described in the requirements:
- It checks for the entire string first.
- It checks for the cases where removing either end of the string could yield a longer non-palindrome substring.
- It correctly identifies when all possible substrings are palindromes.

### Conclusion
The program handles all specified cases and follows the logic required by the problem description, ensuring that it meets the problem's requirements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
