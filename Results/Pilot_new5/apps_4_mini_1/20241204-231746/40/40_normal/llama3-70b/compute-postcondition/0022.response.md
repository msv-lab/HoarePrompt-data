The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is the second character of `s`, which is not a palindrome, `len(substr)` will be equal to 1 (since it is a single character). The previous value of `max_len` is unchanged unless it is less than 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `max_len` is either its previous value or 1; `substr` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `max_len` is max(previous value of `max_len`, 1); `substr` is the second character of `s`.**
