Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and 2. There is no change to `max_len` if `substr` is equal to its reverse.***
