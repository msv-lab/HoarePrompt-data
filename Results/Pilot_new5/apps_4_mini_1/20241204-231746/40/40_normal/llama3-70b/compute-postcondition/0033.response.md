According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. The loop iterates for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and since `i` is currently 1, it can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 2. Additionally, `j` is not directly relevant to whether the loop continues, but it would also need to be updated if it were used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`; `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome; `i` is 2; `j` is `n + 1`; `substr` is the entire string `s`.**
