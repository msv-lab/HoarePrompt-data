Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).***
