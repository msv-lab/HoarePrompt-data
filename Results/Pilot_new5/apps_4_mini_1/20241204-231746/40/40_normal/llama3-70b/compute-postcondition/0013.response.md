According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and since `n` is the length of the non-empty string `s`, it is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 3, and the conditions are met. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`.**
