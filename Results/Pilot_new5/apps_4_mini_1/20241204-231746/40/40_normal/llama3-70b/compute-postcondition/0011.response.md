In the given initial state, `max_len` is 1 and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`, with length `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `len(substr)` will be equal to 2.

The code evaluates `max(max_len, len(substr))`, which translates to `max(1, 2)`. The result of this operation is 2.

The value of `max_len` is updated to 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s.**
