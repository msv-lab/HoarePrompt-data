To analyze the loop execution, we need to consider the variables involved and their initial values. The key variables here are `i`, `n`, and `j`.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)`. The range function generates numbers starting from `i + 1` up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
2. Given that `i` is initialized to `2`, the starting value for `j` will be `i + 1`, which evaluates to `3`.
3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run if `n` is at least `2`, because `j` will take on values 3, 4, ..., up to `n + 1`.

Now, examining the current state:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, which implies that `n` must be at least 1.
- However, for the loop to execute, we specifically need `n` to be at least `2` since `j` starts at `3`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop can execute are:
- `n` must be at least `2`.
- `j` must start at `3`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `substr` is the entire string `s`.**
