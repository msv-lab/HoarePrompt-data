#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer 'n', where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and returns the sum of its digits. The function correctly handles all positive integers within the specified range and performs no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, as it assumes the input will always be a valid positive integer.
