According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to x + 1. For the loop to execute at least once, x must be at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the given condition (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18). The variable `i` will start at 1, which is also appropriate for the range specified.

In summary, the loop will execute as long as the input integer `x` is within its defined limits. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
