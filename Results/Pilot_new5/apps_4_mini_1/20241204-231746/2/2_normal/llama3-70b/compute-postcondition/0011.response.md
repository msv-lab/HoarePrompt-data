The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`, which is 2. The previous information states that `max_sum` would only be updated if `digit_sum` is greater than it, but since we are directly assigning `digit_sum` to `max_sum`, we assume that it is an update regardless of the previous value of `max_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 2; `max_num` is set to 1; `i` is 2; `digit_sum` is 2.**
