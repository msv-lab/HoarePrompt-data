The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` is 3; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3.
