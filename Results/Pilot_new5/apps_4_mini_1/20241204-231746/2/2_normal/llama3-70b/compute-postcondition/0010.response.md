The code calculates `digit_sum` by summing the integer values of each digit in the string representation of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the `digit_sum` will be the sum of the digits of `2`, which is `2`. The previous value of `digit_sum` was `1`, which will be updated. 

The variables `x`, `max_sum`, `max_num`, and `i` remain unchanged in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_num` is set to 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is now 2.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_num` is set to 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 2.**
