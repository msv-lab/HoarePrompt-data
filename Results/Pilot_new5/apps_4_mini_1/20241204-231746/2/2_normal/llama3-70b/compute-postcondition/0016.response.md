The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is 3, so `max_sum` now becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is now 3; `max_num` remains unchanged; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` remains unchanged; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3**
