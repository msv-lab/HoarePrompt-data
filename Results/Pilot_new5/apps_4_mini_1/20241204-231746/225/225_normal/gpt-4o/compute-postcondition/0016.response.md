To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the code and its implications on the variables involved. 

The loop processes each character in the string `s` and checks if it is a vowel. If it is, it updates the `prev_pos` to the current index and calculates the `max_jump` as the maximum between its current value and the distance from the last recorded position of a vowel.

Since `s` is a non-empty string made up of capital English letters, and the loop iterates through each character of `s`, we can conclude the following:
- `prev_pos` will be updated to the last index of a vowel found in the string `s`, or remain -1 if no vowel is found.
- `max_jump` will hold the largest distance found between consecutive vowels, or remain 1 if no vowel is encountered (as it initializes to 1).

Now considering all possible outcomes, particularly if `s` has no vowels, `prev_pos` would remain -1, and `max_jump` would stay as 1 (indicating no jumps occurred).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present; `max_jump` is the maximum distance between consecutive vowels found in `s` or 1 if there are no vowels.**
