Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 2, and `i` is 2. If the character at position `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is updated to 2, and `max_jump` remains either its previous value or is set to 2.***
