The variable `n` is assigned the value `len(s)`, which represents the length of the input string `s`. The value of `s` remains as an input string of capital English letters, and `vowels` remains the same as 'AEIOUY'. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is now equal to the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`.**
