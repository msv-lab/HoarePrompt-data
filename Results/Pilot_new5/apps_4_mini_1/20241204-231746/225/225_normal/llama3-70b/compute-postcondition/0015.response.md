In the given code, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The initial value of `max_jump` is not provided, so we can denote it as `max_jump` for clarity. 

Since `max_jump` could be either greater than or equal to `i + 1` or less than it, we denote its updated value as follows:
- If `max_jump` is greater than or equal to 2, it remains unchanged.
- If `max_jump` is less than 2, it will be set to 2.

The values of the other variables `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `s` is an input string of capital English letters,
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY',
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `i` is 1, 
- `max_jump` is updated to be at least 2.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is max(`max_jump`, 2)**.
