The value of `max_jump` is updated by taking the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The previous value of `max_jump` is not provided, so itâ€™s unknown whether it is greater than, less than, or equal to 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_jump` is now the maximum between its previous value and 1. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current character `s[0]` is a vowel (one of 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'), `last_vowel` is -1, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and 1.**
