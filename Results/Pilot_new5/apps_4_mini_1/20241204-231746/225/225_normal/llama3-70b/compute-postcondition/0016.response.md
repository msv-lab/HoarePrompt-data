To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: `s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
```

1. The variable `max_jump` is being reassigned a new value, which is the maximum of its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
2. The value `i` is 1, but we need the value of `last_vowel` to calculate the new value of `max_jump`. The value of `last_vowel` is not provided in the initial state but would typically represent the index or position of the last vowel found in the string `s`.
3. We do not have specific values for `max_jump` or `last_vowel`, but we know `last_vowel` impacts the calculation.

The output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the reassignment of `max_jump`. Since `max_jump` depends on the calculation involving `last_vowel`, we keep that expression intact.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is max(`max_jump`, (1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**.
