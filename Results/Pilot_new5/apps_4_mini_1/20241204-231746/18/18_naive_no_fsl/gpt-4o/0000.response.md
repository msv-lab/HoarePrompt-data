To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function `func()`.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are `n` spectators, and they stand in waves over time `t`.
   - For time `t`:
     - If `t <= k`: The number of standing spectators is equal to `t`.
     - If `k < t <= n`: The number of standing spectators is `k` (because the first `k` spectators are standing).
     - If `n < t < n + k`: The number of standing spectators decreases as `t` increases. Specifically, the number of standing spectators is calculated as `n + k - t`.

2. **The Program Logic:**
   ```python
   def func():
       (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
       if t <= k:
           print(t)
       elif t <= n:
           print(k)
       else:
           print(n + k - t)
   ```

   - **First Condition (`t <= k`)**: This correctly outputs the number of spectators standing as `t`, which is valid for `t` in the range `[1, k]`.
   - **Second Condition (`t <= n`)**: This correctly outputs `k`, which applies when `t` is in the range `(k, n]`.
   - **Else Condition (`n < t < n + k`)**: This computes the number of standing spectators as `n + k - t`, which should give the correct count as spectators start sitting down.

3. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1**: If `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `t = 1`:
     - Output should be `1` (because the first spectator stands).
   - **Case 2**: If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 6`:
     - Output should be `5` (because the first 5 spectators are standing).
   - **Case 3**: If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 12`:
     - Output should be `3` (because the 12th time corresponds to 3 spectators still standing).

4. **Potential Failure Case:**
   - Consider `t = n + k - 1`. If `n = 10` and `k = 5`, then `t = 14` (which is valid).
     - The program will output `n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 14 = 1`. This is correct.
   - However, test for `t = n + k` (which should yield 0).
     - Using `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 15`:
       - The program will output `n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 15 = 0`. This is also correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   After testing various input cases and considering edge cases, the program consistently produces the correct output as per the problem's requirements. 

Therefore, based on the provided logic and the tests conducted:

Correctness: **True**
