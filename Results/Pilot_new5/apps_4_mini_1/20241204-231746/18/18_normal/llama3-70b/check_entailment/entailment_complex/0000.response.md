The provided program attempts to compute the number of spectators standing at a given time `t` based on the description of the Mexican wave. Let’s analyze the correctness of the program against the problem description provided.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Wave Start**: At time `t = 1`, the first spectator stands up, and this continues until `t = k`, where `k` spectators are standing.
2. **Sitting Down**: After `t = k`, as new spectators stand up, the first ones to stand start sitting down at `t = k + 1` and this continues until all spectators have sat down by `t = n + k`.

The behavior can be summarized as:
- For `1 ≤ t ≤ k`, the number of standing spectators is `t`.
- For `k < t ≤ n`, the number of standing spectators is `k`.
- For `n < t < n + k`, the number of spectators standing decreases as time progresses.

### Program Analysis
The function in the program is structured as follows:
1. If `t <= n`, it returns `min(t, k)`, which correctly covers the first case where the number of spectators standing is equal to `t` if `t` is less than or equal to `k`.
2. If `t > n`, it uses the formula `k - (t - n) % k`. This attempts to calculate how many spectators are still standing based on how far `t` has exceeded `n`.

### Evaluating the Formula
Given that `n < t < n + k`, we need to ensure that `k - (t - n) % k` accurately reflects the standing spectators:
- Since `t` is greater than `n`, `(t - n)` is positive.
- The `% k` operation essentially cycles through the last `k` spectators who were standing, subtracting from `k` to determine how many are still standing as spectators begin to sit down.

This means:
- At `t = n + 1`, `t - n = 1`, thus `k - 1 % k` gives `k - 1`, indicating that 1 spectator has sat down, which is correct.
- At `t = n + 2`, `t - n = 2`, thus `k - 2 % k` gives `k - 2`, indicating that 2 spectators have sat down, which is again correct.
- This pattern continues until `t = n + k`, where all `k` spectators would have sat down, counting down correctly.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the rules of the Mexican wave as described. It handles the different cases for `t` appropriately and adheres to the output requirements.

Thus, the final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
