Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` and computes an output based on the value of `t`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it returns the minimum of `t` and `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it returns `k - (t - n) % k`, effectively calculating a value based on the overflow of `t` beyond `n`. This function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result to the output. **
