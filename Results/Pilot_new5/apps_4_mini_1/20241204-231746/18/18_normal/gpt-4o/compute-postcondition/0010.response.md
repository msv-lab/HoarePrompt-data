The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`. All three parameters are integers constrained by the following conditions: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. Based on these inputs, the function produces output according to specified logic. However, no specific output conditions or return values are provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot detail the return values without additional information on the logic implemented within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters n, k, and t, constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, but specific output conditions or return values are not provided.**
