To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and how it relates to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Frog Movement**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump to `k + a` or `k - b`.
2. **Function f(x)**: This function calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`.
3. **Sum Requirement**: We need to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis
1. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. In `func_2(m, a, b)`, if `g` (the GCD) is not 1, the function reduces the problem size by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. This is appropriate because the jumps can be simplified in this case.
3. The code then calculates `k = a + b - 1` and checks if `m < k`. If this is true, it utilizes the triangular number formula to find the sum of all reachable integers up to `m`.
4. If `m >= k`, it calculates the sum of reachable integers differently based on the triangular number properties.

### Potential Edge Cases
Now we need to consider if there are any edge cases where the function does not behave as expected:

- **Case when `a` or `b` is much larger than `m`**: 
  - Suppose `m = 10`, `a = 20`, and `b = 30`. The frog can only jump to `0` or `-30`, which means the reachable integers are limited to just `0`. This makes `f(0)` = 1, `f(1)` = 1, and so on until `f(10)` = 1. Thus, the expected sum should be `11`. However, the code might not correctly handle this case if it fails to account for the limited reach due to larger jump sizes.

- **Case when both `a` and `b` are equal**: 
  - If `a = b`, the frog can reach positions at intervals of `a` but cannot go below `0`. For example, if `m = 5`, and `a = b = 3`, the reachable positions are `0, 3`, leading to `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 2`, `f(4) = 2`, `f(5) = 2`. This gives sums that could potentially be miscalculated.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we see that the program may not handle certain edge cases correctly, especially when `a` or `b` are significantly larger than `m`, or when `a` and `b` have specific relationships. 

Thus, we find that the code does not cover all the potential cases correctly and can lead to incorrect outputs based on these scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
