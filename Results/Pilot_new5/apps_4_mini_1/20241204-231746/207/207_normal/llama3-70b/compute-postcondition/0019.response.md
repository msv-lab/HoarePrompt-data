Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and `i` is 2. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp`.***
