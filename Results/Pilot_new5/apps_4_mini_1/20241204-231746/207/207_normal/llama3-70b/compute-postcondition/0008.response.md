The initial state indicates that `i` is currently 0, which allows us to proceed with the condition `i - b >= 0`, meaning `b` has to be equal to 0 for this to hold true since `i` is 0. The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` will be executed, and `i - b` will evaluate to `0 - 0`, which is 0. Therefore, we will update `dp[0]` by adding `dp[0]` to it. The state of `m`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[0] + dp[0]`.**
