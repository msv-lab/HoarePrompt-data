Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and `i` is 0. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0 (which implies `b` is 0 since `i` is initially 0), then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[0] + dp[0]`. Otherwise, the program does not modify `dp[i]`.***
