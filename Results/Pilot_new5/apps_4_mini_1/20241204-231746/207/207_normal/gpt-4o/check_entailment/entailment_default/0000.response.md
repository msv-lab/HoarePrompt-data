To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we need to analyze both the code and the expected behavior described.

### Initial Assessment of the Code

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function computes the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It appears to be correctly implemented as it handles the case when `y` is initially `0` by returning `x`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function computes the sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach based on its jump rules defined by `a` and `b`.
   - The function handles the case when the GCD `g` is not `1` by reducing the problem size recursively. 
   - The function uses the values of `k` (`a + b - 1`) to determine how to calculate `f(i)` based on whether `m` is less than `k` or not. 

### Edge Cases Consideration
- The case when `m < k` would result in `f(i)` simply being the count of integers from `0` to `m`, which seems valid.
- The scenario when `g` is not `1` ensures that the problem handles cases with multiples of `a` and `b`. 

### Output Hints Evaluation
- The hints state that the function correctly implements the logic for counting reachable integers according to the jump rules and the conditions based on `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- The description of the output hints aligns with the implementation of `func_2`, as it accounts for all potential ranges and conditions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing both the code and the output hints, I did not find any edge cases or scenarios where the implementation fails to meet the description. The logic seems sound, and there are no indications of missed cases in the output hints as they align with the functionality of the code.

Thus, based on the thorough examination of all provided aspects, the program appears to work correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation
The program calculates the required sum of reachable integers based on the rules defined, correctly accounts for the GCD of `a` and `b`, and handles different ranges of `m` in its computations. All described behaviors align with the expected outcomes as outlined in the problem description.
