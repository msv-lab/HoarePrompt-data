`sum_k` is assigned the value of the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`, `k` will also be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 199998 (when both `a` and `b` are at their maximum). The formula calculates the sum of the first `k` integers. The values of `m`, `g`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `sum_k` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
