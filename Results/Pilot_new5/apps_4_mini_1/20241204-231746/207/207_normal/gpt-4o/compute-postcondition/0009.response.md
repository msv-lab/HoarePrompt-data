To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step.

1. The variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `g`, `k`, and `sum_k` have defined values according to the initial state.
2. The code computes `sum_m` using the formula:

   \[
   sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
   \]

3. We know that `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`. Therefore, we can substitute `k` in the equation above.

4. The final value of `sum_m` will depend on the specific values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, but we don't have these values specified.

5. All other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `g`, `k`, and `sum_k`) remain unchanged except for the new variable `sum_m`, which now holds the value calculated from the provided formula.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `sum_k` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`**.
