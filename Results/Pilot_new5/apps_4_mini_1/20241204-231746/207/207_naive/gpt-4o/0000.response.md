To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description.

The program aims to compute the sum of reachable integers by a frog starting from position 0, given that it can make jumps of size `a` to move right or jumps of size `b` to move left, without exceeding the bounds of the interval `[0, m]`.

### Analyzing the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation**: The function `func_1(x, y)` correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. This is important since if the GCD is `1`, the frog can reach every integer between `0` and `m`.
3. **Reduction Based on GCD**: The program reduces the problem based on the GCD, which is correct. It ensures that the jumps are effectively simplified when `a` and `b` share common factors.
4. **Computing `f(m)` Values**:
   - If the derived value of `k` (the sum of `a` and `b` minus `1`) is greater than `m`, it computes the sum based on the formula for the first `m` integers.
   - If `m` is large enough to exceed `k`, it computes the sum of `f(i)` values up to `m`.
  
### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `b` is greater than `m`**: The frog might not reach certain numbers effectively because it can't jump left beyond `0`. The function should account for cases where `b` restricts downward movement.
2. **When `a` or `b` are significantly larger**: This can affect how the frog reaches certain integers especially when `m` is small compared to `a` and `b`. The program should ensure correct count of reachable integers in these cases.
3. **Initialization Cases**: Specifically, starting from the lowest bounds, it should ensure that at least integer `0` is always reachable.

### Conclusion:
While the program appears to handle many cases correctly, it doesn't explicitly test or count the integers reachable from these edge cases extensively. For instance, if `b` is very large relative to `m`, the function may not reflect the proper count of reachable integers, especially in scenarios where `m` is at its lower bounds. 

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the program may not adhere strictly to the problem's requirement for all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

For instance, if `m = 10`, `a = 5`, and `b = 15`, the frog cannot effectively make downward jumps, leading to an incorrect count of reachable integers.
