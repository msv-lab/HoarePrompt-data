The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `j` is `i + 3` with `n` greater than `j`; `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
