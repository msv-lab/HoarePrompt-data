Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; `rated` remains False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `unrated` is False if any `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]` for any `j`; `maybe` remains True unless `unrated` is set to False; `i` is still 0; `j` will be `n` after the loop execution ends, indicating that all relevant comparisons have been made.**
