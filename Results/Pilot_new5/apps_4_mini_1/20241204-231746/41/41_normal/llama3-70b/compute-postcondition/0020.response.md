According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, the lowest value of `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (which it is, since 2 ≤ n). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will represent the index of the next element in the range, which will be directly affected by the value of `n`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `j` will be 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
