The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which is split into two integers. The variable `n` remains as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and the loop will iterate `n` times. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are two integers obtained from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are two integers obtained from user input.**
