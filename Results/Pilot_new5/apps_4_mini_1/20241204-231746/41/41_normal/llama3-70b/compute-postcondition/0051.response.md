Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; `unrated` is False; `rated` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `maybe` remains True; `i` is 1; `j` is `n`. If there exists any `j` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` becomes False immediately upon finding such a `j`; otherwise, `unrated` remains unchanged.**
