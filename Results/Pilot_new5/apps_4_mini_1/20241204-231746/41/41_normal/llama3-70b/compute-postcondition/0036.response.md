Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; if `unrated` is False, then `rated` remains False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `maybe` remains True; `i` is still 0; `j` will be `n` after the loop execution ends, indicating that all relevant comparisons have been made and we break out of the most internal loop.***
