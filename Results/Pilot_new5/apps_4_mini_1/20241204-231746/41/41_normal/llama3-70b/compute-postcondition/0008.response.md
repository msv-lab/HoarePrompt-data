The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes user input and assigns the first value to `a` and the second value to `b`. The previous values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` suggest that both `a` and `b` were already appended to their respective lists. After executing this line, `a` and `b` will have the newly inputted integer values.

Since `ratings_before` had `a` appended to it before this line, it will remain unchanged. The same goes for `ratings_after`, which had `b` appended to it before this line. 

The output state reflects that the values of `a` and `b` are now set to the most recent user inputs.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is a new user input integer, `b` is a new user input integer, `ratings_before` has the value `ratings_before.append(a)`, `ratings_after` has the value `ratings_after.append(b)`.**
