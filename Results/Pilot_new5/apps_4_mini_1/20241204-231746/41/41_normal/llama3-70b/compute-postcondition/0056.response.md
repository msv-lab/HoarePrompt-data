According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will begin at `j = i + 1` and continue until `j` is less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. Since `n` is an integer in the range from 2 to 1000, if `i` is at its maximum possible value of 998, `j` would start at 999, which is less than `n` (1000). 

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` to allow for at least one iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be less than `n - 1`, meaning `i` can range from 0 to `n - 2`.
- `j` should start at `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` must be less than `n - 1, j is i + 1`**
