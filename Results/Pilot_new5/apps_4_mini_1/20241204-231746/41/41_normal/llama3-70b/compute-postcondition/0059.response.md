The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure that we were currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` equals `i + 1`, the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]`, the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
