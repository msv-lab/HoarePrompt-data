Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `rated` is True if at least one pair of ratings differs between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, otherwise `rated` remains False; `unrated` is True if all pairs of ratings are equal, otherwise `unrated` is False; `i` is `n` after all iterations of the loop are complete; `j` remains beyond the last index.**
