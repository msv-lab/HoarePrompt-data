According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is guaranteed to be an integer between 2 and 1000. The loop does not depend on the `ratings_before` or `ratings_after` lists, as they are empty and do not affect the number of iterations. Since the loop variable is not used in the body, there are no additional adjustments needed for it.

Thus, the only relevant states before the loop are the values of `n`, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, and the fact that the loop will iterate 0 to n-1. After the last iteration, there are no changes to `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, loop will iterate n times**
