According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `i + 1`, and since `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \), for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Thus, `j` will be `i + 2` and for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, and `j` is `i + 2`, where `n` must be greater than `i + 2**.
