According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an integer that indicates how many iterations the loop will perform. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is within the range of 2 to 1000, and the loop has run for `_` iterations. 

Since the loop has executed `n` times already, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be at least `n + 1`, which means the loop has already completed all its iterations.

To summarize, the variable `_` will increment by 1 for each iteration, so after the last iteration, `_` must be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be increased to `n` after the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is a new user input integer; `b` is a new user input integer; `ratings_before` has the value indicating that `a` has been added to the list; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list; `_` is equal to n**
