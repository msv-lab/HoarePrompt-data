According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, the loop can execute again until `i` reaches `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, and `unrated` is False. This means the loop can continue executing, and `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, the state of `unrated` remains unchanged as it is False, and `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `unrated` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
