The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and reads `n` pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round. It checks if at least one pair of these ratings is different, indicating that the participant is rated. If any pairs are unequal, it outputs 'rated'. If all pairs are equal, it further checks if there is any increase in consecutive ratings; if such an increase is found, it outputs 'unrated'. If no increases are found, it outputs 'maybe'. Thus, the function assesses the rating status of participants based on the provided ratings.
