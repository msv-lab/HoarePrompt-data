The code `break` does not change any variable values but exits the most immediate loop or if statement in which it is encountered. 

Since `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are not directly affected, and the values of `ratings`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, the Output State retains all previous information except for indicating the termination of the closest loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
