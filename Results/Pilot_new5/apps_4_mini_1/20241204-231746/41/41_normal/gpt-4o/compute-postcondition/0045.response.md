Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `ratings` contains `n` tuples of the form `(a, b)`. If `is_rated` is True, then `is_unrated` remains False and the output is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is False, then if at least one pair of consecutive ratings shows an increase, `is_unrated` becomes True, `is_rated` remains False, and the output is 'unrated'. Otherwise, `is_unrated` is False, `is_rated` is False, and the output is 'maybe'.***
