The value of `is_rated` is explicitly set to `True`. The previous state indicates that `is_rated` was dependent on the condition that `a` is not equal to `b`. However, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, `is_rated` is now unconditionally true. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` includes the tuples `(a, b)` and any previously stored tuples, `is_rated` is True.**
