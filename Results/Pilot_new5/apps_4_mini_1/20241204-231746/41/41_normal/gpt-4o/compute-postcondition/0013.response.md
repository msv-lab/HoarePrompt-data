The code sets `is_rated` to `True`, indicating that the ratings have been finalized. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is still 1, `a` is still an input integer, `b` is still an input integer, and `ratings` still includes the tuple `(a, b)` with the new values of `a` and `b`. The state of the variables that have been modified are as follows:

- `is_rated` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` with the new values of `a` and `b`, `is_rated` is True.**
