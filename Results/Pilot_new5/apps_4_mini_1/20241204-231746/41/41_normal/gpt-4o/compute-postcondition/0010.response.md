According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the loop variable `_`. The loop variable `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n`. Since the current state indicates that `_` is the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `_` for the loop to execute again will be the current value of `_` incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is the current loop variable. For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, meaning it will become `1` if it was previously `0`, and the loop will continue until it reaches `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \), it must be greater than the current value of `_`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`.**
