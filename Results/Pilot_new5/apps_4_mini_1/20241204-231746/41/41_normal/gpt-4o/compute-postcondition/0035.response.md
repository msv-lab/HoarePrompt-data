To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop and its conditions based on the initial state and the statements provided for each iteration.

The loop checks for a pair of consecutive ratings in the list `ratings`. If it finds that the first of the pair is less than the second, it sets `is_unrated` to True and breaks out of the loop. If all comparisons are made and none satisfy the condition, `is_unrated` remains False.

1. **If the loop executes at least once:**  
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 (which it is, as per the initial state).
   - If the loop ends up setting `is_unrated` to True, that means at least one of the pair comparisons has shown that a rating has increased.

2. **If the loop executes through to the end without breaking:**  
   - This means that for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` was never satisfied.
   - In this case, `is_unrated` remains False, indicating that the ratings did not increase at any point.

Now, based on this reasoning, we can summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is True if at least one pair of consecutive ratings shows an increase; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False.**
