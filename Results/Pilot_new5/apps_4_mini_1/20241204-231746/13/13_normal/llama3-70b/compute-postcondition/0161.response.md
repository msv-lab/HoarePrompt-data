The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` satisfies the constraint that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\). The string `s` has a length of `n` and consists solely of the characters 'G' and 'S'. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result based on their values. However, the exact return value based on the processing of `n` and `s` is not specified in the provided output information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.**
