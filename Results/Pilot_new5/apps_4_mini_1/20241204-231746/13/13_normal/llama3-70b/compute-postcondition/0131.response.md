The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` remains unchanged, and the element `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
