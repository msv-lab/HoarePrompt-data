The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The conditions state that `left` must be less than `right` after incrementing, and `s` must not have 'G' at index `left + 1`. Since the initial constraints do not specify the exact value of `left`, it is sufficient to note that `left` is now increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left + 1`, and `left` is incremented by 1, still less than `right`.**
