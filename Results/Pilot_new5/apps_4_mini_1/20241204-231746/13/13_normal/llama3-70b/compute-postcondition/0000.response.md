The value of `n` is reassigned to `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The original condition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000 still holds true after this assignment. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000 (updated to the input integer)**
