The given code snippet updates the variable `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. The values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` affect the output state, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`, `right` is 2, and `max_beauty` is updated to max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)**.
