Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to either 2 or 3, while `max_beauty` may be updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`. If `s[j]` is not 'G', the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `max_beauty` remains unchanged or updated as previously stated. In both cases, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, and `right` is equal to `n`, with `max_beauty_one_swap` being 0.***
