Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, and `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is increased to 2, while `left` remains 0 and `right` is 1. If `s[right]` is not 'G', then `max_beauty` is set to 1, `curr_beauty` is 1 if `left` is less than `right`, otherwise, `curr_beauty` remains 0. The value of `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n` if 'G' is not found, and `right` is greater than or equal to `left`.***
