According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` takes the values from `i - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 2, `i - 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `j` should start at `i - 1`, which is `n - 2`, and `j` will be decremented in the loop until it reaches `-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` remains unchanged**
