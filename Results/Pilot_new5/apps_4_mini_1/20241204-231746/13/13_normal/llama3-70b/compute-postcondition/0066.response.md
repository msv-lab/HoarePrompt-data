The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state of the variables indicates that `beauty` was either previously 1 (if `s[j]` is not 'G') or 2 (if `s[j]` is 'G'). Therefore, after the increment, if it was 1, it becomes 2, and if it was 2, it becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is greater than 0, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is either 2 or 3.**
