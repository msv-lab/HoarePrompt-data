According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left`, `right`, and the character at position `left` in the string `s`. The loop can execute if both conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` are satisfied.

Given that `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, if there is a 'G' present at `s[left]`, then `s[left] != 'G'` will be false and the loop will not execute. Thus, for the loop to execute, `left` must not point to an index where 'G' is located.

The conditions provided state that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`, `right` is 2, and `curr_beauty` is initialized to 0.

For the loop to execute for the first time, `left` must be less than `right` (which is currently 2) and must point to an index in `s` where there is no 'G' present. Therefore, we need to ensure that `left` is initialized to an index that does not point to 'G'. This means we need to ensure `left` is set to an index that does not contain 'G' or that there is no 'G' before the index of `right`.

To summarize:
- If `left` is set to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, we need to ensure there are no 'G's in the indices from 0 to `right - 1`.

Thus, we adjust the state to ensure that `left` does not point to a 'G':

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left`; `golden` must be empty or must not include indices less than `right`; `left` is less than `right`**
