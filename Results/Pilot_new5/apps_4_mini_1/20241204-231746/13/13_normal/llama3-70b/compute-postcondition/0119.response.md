The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions for `n`, `i`, and `j`, while indicating the increment of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 4`, `beauty` is increased by 1**.
