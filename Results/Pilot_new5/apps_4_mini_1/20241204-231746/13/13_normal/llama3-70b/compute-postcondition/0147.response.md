Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to `2 + k`, where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`, with `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` remaining unchanged. Otherwise, `beauty` remains `1 + k`, with `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
