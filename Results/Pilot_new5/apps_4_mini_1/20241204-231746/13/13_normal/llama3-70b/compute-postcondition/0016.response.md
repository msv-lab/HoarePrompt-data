According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the conditions of `left`, `right`, and `s[left]`. For the loop to continue executing, both conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` must hold true.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `left` is at least 2.
- `right` must be greater than 0.
- `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions still hold. Since `left` is at least 2, we can assume it could be incremented, but we need `left` to be less than `right`. Thus, `right` must be greater than `left` after any possible increments.

Additionally, since `s[left]` is guaranteed to not be 'G', this condition is fulfilled.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `right` to be greater than `left`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 2, `right` must be greater than `left`**
