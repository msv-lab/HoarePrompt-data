Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is equal to `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from index `i` down to the first non-'G', `curr_beauty` is equal to `beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`. If there are no 'G's encountered from `i + 2` to `n - 1`, then `beauty` would remain as the original value of `1`.**
