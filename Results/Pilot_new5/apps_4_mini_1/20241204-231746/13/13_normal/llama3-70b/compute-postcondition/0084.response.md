According to the code, the loop's ability to execute again depends on the current value of `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is initiated with `j` starting from `i + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, since `j` has been updated to `i + 2`, the next time the loop executes, `j` will increment by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Given that `j` is currently `i + 2`, for the loop to run again, we need `i + 2` to be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` will be `i + 3` for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we can summarize the variables as follows:
- `j` should be updated to `i + 3`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 3` to allow the loop to run.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than `i + 3`, and `j` is `i + 3`**.
