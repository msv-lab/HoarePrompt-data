The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, and `i` must be greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
