Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, and `j` is initialized to `i + 2`. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` is not 'G', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
