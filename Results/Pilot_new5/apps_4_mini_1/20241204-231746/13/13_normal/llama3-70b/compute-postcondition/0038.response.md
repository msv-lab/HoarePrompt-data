According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `right` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The current state shows that `right` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, and the loop will continue executing as long as `right` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 1. If it increments by 1, `right` will become 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `right` should be less than `n`, which is already satisfied as long as `n` is greater than 2 (and we know from the state that `n` is at least 2).

The value of `left` must also be updated according to the logic provided. If there exists at least one 'G' in the string `s`, and `left` has been previously updated to the index of the first 'G', it will remain valid. If there is no 'G' found yet, `left` will be updated to `n`.

Thus, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:
- `right` will be 2.
- `left` will be updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`.

In summary, the states need to reflect the changes as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`, `right` is 2**
