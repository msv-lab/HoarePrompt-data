According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the variable `i` and the specified range `n - 1`. The current value of `i` determines how many times the loop has executed so far. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have the exact value of `i`, but we know it is less than `n - 1` since it hasn't reached that point yet. When the loop executes again, `i` will be incremented by 1, leading to the next value of `i`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n - 2` and the loop still has to satisfy the condition that `i` remains less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states would be: `i` is now `n - 2`, and we still have to satisfy the conditions for other variables like `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `curr_beauty`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 2`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i + 2` until a non-'G' character is encountered.**
