The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 1, so the new value of `left` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` must not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` must be greater than 1.
