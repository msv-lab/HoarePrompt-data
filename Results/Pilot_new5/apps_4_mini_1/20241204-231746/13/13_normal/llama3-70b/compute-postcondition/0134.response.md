The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, `i` must be greater than 1, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, `i` must be greater than 1, `beauty` is increased by 1**
