According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` compared to the bounds of the range specified in the for loop. The loop starts at `i - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches -1 (exclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the index of the last evaluated value. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j - 1`.

Since `j` starts at `i - 1`, the next value for `j` will be `i - 2`. Additionally, since the loop iterates while `j` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, if `j` was `i - 1`, then for the loop to execute again, we have:
- `j` will become `i - 2`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged as it was 0
- `max_beauty` may still be updated as stated previously, but it is not directly affected by the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, `max_beauty` may be updated as previously stated, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0**
