The variable `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. The value of `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i + 2` until a non-'G' character is encountered. The states of the other variables remain unchanged during this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i + 2` until a non-'G' character is encountered, and `j` is updated to `n` if the loop does not execute, or to the value of the last index checked plus 1 if it executes.**
