According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, meaning the maximum value of `i` could be `n - 3`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `i + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`. Since `j` will be `i + 3`, the condition for the loop to run again is that `i + 3` must be less than `n`. This means that `i` must be less than `n - 3`.

Thus, we can conclude that:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3**.
