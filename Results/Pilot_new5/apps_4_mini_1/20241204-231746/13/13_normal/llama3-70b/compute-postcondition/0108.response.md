According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts at `i + 2` and goes up to but not including `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 2` must be less than `n`, which means that `i` must be less than `n - 2`. 

The beauty-related variables, such as `beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `max_beauty`, do not directly influence whether the loop executes, but their states may be important for the loop body execution.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `i` is less than `n - 2`, and initialize `j` to the value of `i + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`**
