The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the first character of `trophies` is 'S'.
