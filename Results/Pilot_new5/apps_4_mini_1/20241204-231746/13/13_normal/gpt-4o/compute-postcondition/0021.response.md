The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the precondition that `n` must be greater than `i`, the new value of `i` will still satisfy the condition, but we do not have specific values for `i` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
