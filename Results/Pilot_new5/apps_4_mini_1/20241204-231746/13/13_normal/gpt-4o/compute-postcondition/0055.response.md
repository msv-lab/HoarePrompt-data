Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of segments, `max_length` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_length` and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`, given that `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2. If `curr_start - prev_end` is not equal to 2, the values of `max_length`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged.***
