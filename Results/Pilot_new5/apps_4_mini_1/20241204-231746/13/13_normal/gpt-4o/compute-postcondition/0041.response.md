Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is a list that contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)` if `trophies[i]` is 'G', indicating the segment of consecutive 'G's up to the first 'S'. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `i` is incremented by 1, and `segments` remains unchanged.***
