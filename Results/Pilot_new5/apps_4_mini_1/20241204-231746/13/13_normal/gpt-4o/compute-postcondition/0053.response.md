Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of segments, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length of segments calculated from `segments`, length of `segments` is greater than 1, `prev_start` is the starting index of segment `segments[0]`, `prev_end` is the ending index of segment `segments[0]`, `curr_start` is the starting index of segment `segments[1]`, `curr_end` is the ending index of segment `segments[1]`. The current value of `curr_start` minus the current value of `prev_end` equals 2.***
