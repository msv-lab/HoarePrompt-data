Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 3 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1 + 1`.***
