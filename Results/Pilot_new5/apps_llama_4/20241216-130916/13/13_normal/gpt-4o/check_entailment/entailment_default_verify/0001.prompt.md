You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. 

One potential case it fails to handle is when there are multiple pairs of segments that can be merged by swapping two trophies. The program only checks the segments that are adjacent, but it does not consider non-adjacent segments that can be merged by swapping two trophies. 

For example, consider the input "SGGGGSGGG", the program will not be able to find the optimal solution, which is to swap the 'S' at the beginning and the 'S' in the middle to get "GGGGGSGGG". 

The program needs to be modified to check all possible pairs of segments and not just adjacent ones.

In the given code:

- The line `if curr_start - prev_end == 2:` only checks if the current and previous segments are separated by a single 'S'. It does not handle cases where they are separated by more than one 'S' or other 'G' segments.

- The line `max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)` only considers the case where the current and previous segments are merged by swapping two trophies. It does not consider other possible swaps that could merge non-adjacent segments.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to check all possible pairs of 'S' and 'G' segments and not just adjacent ones. 

The code provided does not cover all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and therefore, does not produce the correct output for all possible inputs. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. 

To write a correct program, we should consider all possible pairs of 'S' and 'G' segments and not just adjacent ones. This could be done by iterating over all pairs of 'S' and 'G' segments, and for each pair, check if swapping them would increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. 

Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if trophies[i] == 'S' and trophies[j] == 'S':
                new_trophies = list(trophies)
                new_trophies[i], new_trophies[j] = new_trophies[j], new_trophies[i]
                length = 0
                max_temp = 0
                for k in range(n):
                    if new_trophies[k] == 'G':
                        length += 1
                        max_temp = max(max_temp, length)
                    else:
                        length = 0
                max_length = max(max_length, max_temp)
    if max_length == 0:
        length = 0
        max_temp = 0
        for k in range(n):
            if trophies[k] == 'G':
                length += 1
                max_temp = max(max_temp, length)
            else:
                length = 0
        return max_temp
    return max_length
```
This code checks all possible pairs of 'S' and 'G' segments and returns the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', identifies sequences of 'G's, and returns 0 if no sequences are found, the length of a single sequence if only one exists, or the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's (including those separated by a single character) plus one and `n`, while potentially ignoring invalid inputs and edge cases not explicitly handled by the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
