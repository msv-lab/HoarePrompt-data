The code increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `curr_beauty`, we cannot determine its exact value after the increment operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the last index plus one, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1**
