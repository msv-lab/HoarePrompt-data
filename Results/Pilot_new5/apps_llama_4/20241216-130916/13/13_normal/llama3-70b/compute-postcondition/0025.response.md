To calculate the result, we need to list the impact of the code on the program. The code updates the `max_beauty` variable by comparing its current value with `curr_beauty` and assigning the maximum of the two to `max_beauty`. 

The value of `curr_beauty` is not provided in the initial state, so we will keep `curr_beauty` as is. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `right` is the current index plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value (0) and `curr_beauty`, `right` is the current index plus 1**
