Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` equals `i - 1` at the start of the loop, and `beauty` is 1. The current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
