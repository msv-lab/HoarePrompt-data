Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, if `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, otherwise, if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is 1, otherwise, the state of `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, and other variables remain unchanged from the precondition, with `left` being either equal to `right` or the index of the next 'G' character in `s`.**
