The code updates the value of `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. The value of `max_beauty` is now the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters before an 'S' and the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s` if it's greater than the previous `max_beauty`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, and `right` equals `n`.**
