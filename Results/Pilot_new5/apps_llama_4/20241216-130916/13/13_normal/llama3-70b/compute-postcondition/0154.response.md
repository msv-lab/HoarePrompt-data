The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The previous values of the variables are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 4`, and `beauty` will be updated based on whether `s[j]` is 'G' or 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
