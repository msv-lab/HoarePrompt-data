To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **`left < right`**: For this condition to be true, `left` must be less than `right`. Given that `right` is the last index plus one and `left` is 2, this condition is currently true because 2 is less than the last index plus one (since `n` is between 2 and 10^5, inclusive, and the string `s` has a length of `n`).

2. **`s[left]!= 'G'`**: For this condition to be true, the character at index `left` in string `s` must not be 'G'. Since we know `s[1]` was 'S' and we are considering `left` starting from 2 (since `left` is 2), we need to ensure that `s[2]` (and subsequent indices if `left` moves) is not 'G' for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time:

- `left` must still be less than `right`. Since `right` is determined by the length of the string `s` and `left` is currently 2, this condition does not need an adjustment as long as `n` is greater than 2, which it is (between 2 and 10^5, inclusive).
- `s[left]` must not be 'G'. Since we're considering the next iteration and `left` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `s[2]` is not 'G'. However, the condition also depends on future positions as `left` increments, meaning `s` at any index that `left` will take must not be 'G' until `left` reaches or surpasses `right` or finds a 'G'.

Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the state variables `n`, `s` (other than ensuring that `s[left]` is not 'G' for the next iteration, which is implicitly considered in the loop condition), `golden`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, `right`, or `left` beyond what the loop condition inherently requires. The loop will proceed as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at `left` in `s` is not 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters and `s[1]` was 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s` excluding the index `0`, `curr_beauty` is `0`, `max_beauty` is `0`, `right` is the last index plus one, and `left` is 2**
