Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0. If the character at the current index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 1 and `left` is 0. Otherwise, `right` remains its original value, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left (if such a character exists and is before `right`), or `left` equals `right` (if no 'G' character is found before `right`), and `curr_beauty` is 1 if `left` is less than `right`, otherwise `curr_beauty` remains 0.***
