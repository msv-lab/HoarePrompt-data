The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is the index of the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`, or `-1` if no 'S' character is found, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Additionally, `s[j]` is 'S' if `j` is not `-1`, meaning the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'S', indicating that the condition to enter the if block is false. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
