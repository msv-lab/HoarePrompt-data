#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of any characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a string formed by concatenating characters from the original string 's' at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string formed by concatenating characters from `s` that are located at even indices. This means that if `s` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string. It correctly handles any character in the string, including special characters and spaces.
