Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It does this by using a list comprehension that iterates over the indices of the string, selecting only those at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This implementation will work for any input string, including empty strings and strings of different lengths. 

For example:
- Input: `"abcdef"` will return `"ace"`, which is correct as it includes characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.
- Input: `"123456789"` will return `"13579"`, which correctly excludes characters at odd indices.
- Input: `""` (empty string) will return `""`, which is again correct.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases appropriately, it is deemed correct.
