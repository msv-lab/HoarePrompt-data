Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even numbers from the input list. 

Here's how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a parameter named `numbers`, which is specified to be a list of integers.
2. **Processing**: The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` iterates through each integer in the list and checks if it is even (i.e., if `num % 2` equals 0). If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list.
3. **Output**: The function returns a new list that consists solely of the even numbers from the original list.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty list (which would return an empty list).
- A list with no even numbers (which also returns an empty list).
- A list containing both even and odd numbers (which returns only the even numbers).

Therefore, the program is correct and adheres to the requirements of the problem description.
