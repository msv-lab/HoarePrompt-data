Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` includes all the months that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function checks if the provided month number is present in this set.

The provided assertions test various month numbers:
- `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days)
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days)
- `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June does not have 31 days)
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days)
- `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days)
- `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November does not have 31 days)

All of these tests conform to the problem description, and since no edge cases where the function would fail are present, the code is correct.
