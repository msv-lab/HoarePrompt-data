Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given month number `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days. It uses a list `months_31_days` that contains the month numbers (1 for January, 3 for March, 5 for May, etc.) that have 31 days.

1. If `n` is one of the numbers in that list (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), it returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days.
2. If `n` is any other number (like 2 for February or 4 for April), it returns `False`, indicating the month does not have 31 days.

This logic is comprehensive for all valid month numbers (1 through 12), and the function correctly handles the inputs as expected, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements.
