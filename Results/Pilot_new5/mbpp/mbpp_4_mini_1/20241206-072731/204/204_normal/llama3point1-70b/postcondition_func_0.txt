The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month number (1 to 12) and returns True if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December); otherwise, it returns False. It does not validate whether `n` is within the range of 1 to 12, which could lead to unintended results if `n` is outside this range.
