#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if month is in months_with_31_days, which includes January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` that represents a month (from 1 to 12) and returns `True` if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). It returns `False` for months with fewer than 31 days (February, April, June, September, November).
