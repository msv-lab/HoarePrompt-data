The statement `list1 = list2` assigns `list2` to `list1`, meaning both variables will reference the same list object. Since `list1` was initially an empty list, after the assignment, `list1` will now hold the same contents as `list2`. The state of `list2` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`list1` is the same as `list2`, `list2` is a list**
