Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem statement, the function must replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). However, the provided implementation of the function `func_1` concatenates the elements of `list1` (excluding the last element) with the entire `list2`, instead of replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.

For example, if `list1` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `list2` is `[2, 4, 6]`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6]`. Instead, the implementation would yield `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6]` which appears correct, but the crucial aspect is that the last element of `list1` should be replaced with the elements of `list2` (thus the last element of `list1` is removed), and that is not what the code is designed to do.

In summary, the function does not adhere to the requirement of replacing the last element; it only removes it without fulfilling the replacement with elements from `list2`. Hence, the implementation is incorrect.
