Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the function must replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

However, the implementation in `func_1` uses the following line:

```python
return list1[:-1] + list2
```

This line creates a new list by taking all elements of `list1` except the last one (`list1[:-1]`) and concatenating it with `list2`. As a result, the last element of `list1` is removed and not replaced by the elements of `list2`. 

To clarify with an example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the expected output according to the problem description should be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` (where `10` is replaced by `2, 4, 6, 8`). However, the function actually returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` (which seems correct for this test case), but it does not fulfill the requirement of replacing the last element.

A proper implementation should replace the last element of `list1` with the entirety of `list2`. For instance, if `list1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the correct output should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, showing that `3` was replaced by `4` and `5`.

In summary, since the implementation does not replace the last element of `list1` with `list2` as required, but instead removes it, the correctness of the program should be marked as **False**.
