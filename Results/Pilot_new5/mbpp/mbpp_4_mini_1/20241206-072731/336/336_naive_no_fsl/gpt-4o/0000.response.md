Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. It does so by iterating over the indices of the list starting from 1 (the first odd index) and checking if the elements at these indices are even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, it returns `True`.

Let's break down the provided assertions:

1. `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])`:
   - Odd indices are 1, 3, 5, 7 which correspond to the values 1, 3, 7, 3.
   - All are odd, so it returns `True`.

2. `func_1([4, 1, 2])`:
   - Odd index is 1 which corresponds to the value 1.
   - Since 1 is odd, it returns `True`.

3. `func_1([1, 2, 3])`:
   - Odd index is 1 which corresponds to the value 2.
   - Since 2 is even, it returns `False`.

The function handles cases correctly as per the problem description, and no potential edge cases have been identified where it would fail. Thus, the function works as expected for the given requirements.
