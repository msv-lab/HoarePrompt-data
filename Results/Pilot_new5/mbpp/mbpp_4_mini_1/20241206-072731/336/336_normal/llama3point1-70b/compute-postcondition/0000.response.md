According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` has at least 1 integer since `len(lst)` must be greater than 0. At the start of the loop, the index `i` will start at 0, which corresponds to the first element of the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list `lst` must contain at least 1 integer, and `i` will initially be 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
