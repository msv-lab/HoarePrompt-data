#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that must have an even length, `i` is the last odd index of `lst`, and all elements at the odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at an odd index of `lst` were even, the function would have returned False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that all elements at the odd indices of the list 'lst' are odd integers, and the list has an even length, ensuring the function would not return False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if any element at an odd index of the list is even. If all elements at odd indices are odd and the list has an even length, it returns True. However, if the list has an odd length, the function does not explicitly handle this case, but it will not return True because the for loop only iterates up to the last odd index, leading to a potential oversight in handling lists of odd length.
