The function `func_1` is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers `nums`. 

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
```
This list comprehension iterates over each number in `nums` and includes it in the resulting list if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). 

Now, let's analyze the problem description:
- The problem states that the function should filter odd numbers, which aligns with what the code is doing.

Next, we will consider edge cases:
1. **Empty List**: If `nums` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list `[]`, which is the correct behavior as there are no odd numbers to filter.
2. **All Even Numbers**: If `nums` contains only even numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6, 8]`), the function will return an empty list, which is also expected.
3. **Mixed Numbers**: If `nums` contains both odd and even numbers, the function will correctly return only the odd numbers.

The output hints clarify that:
- The function accepts a list of integers and returns a list of all odd integers from that list.
- It does not specifically mention handling non-integer types, but it assumes all elements are integers, which is acceptable given the problem statement.

After careful analysis:
- The function correctly implements the requirement to filter odd numbers, handles the edge cases described, and the output hints align with the code behavior.

Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **True**.
