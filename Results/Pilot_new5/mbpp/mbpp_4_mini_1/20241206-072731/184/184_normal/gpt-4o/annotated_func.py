#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a list containing all the odd integers from `nums`. It does not handle cases where `nums` might be empty, but it will simply return an empty list in that case, which is the correct behavior. The function does not filter or process any other types of elements, and it assumes that all elements in the input are integers.
