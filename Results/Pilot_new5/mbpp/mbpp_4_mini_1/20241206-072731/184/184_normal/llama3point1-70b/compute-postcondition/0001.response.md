The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers from `nums` that are odd (i.e., not divisible by 2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return a list containing only the odd integers from that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums and returns a list of integers from nums that are odd (not divisible by 2).**
