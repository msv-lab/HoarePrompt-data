Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality to filter odd numbers from a list. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., numbers for which `num % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True`). 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`** 
   - Output: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` - Correct.
   
2. **Input: `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`**
   - Output: `[45, 67, 93]` - Correct.

3. **Input: `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`**
   - Output: `[5, 7, 9, 3]` - Correct.

The function handles all provided test cases correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases or input scenarios where the function would fail to filter out even numbers. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided implementation, the function meets the correctness criteria.
