Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not account for all types of whitespace characters. The problem description states to remove all whitespaces from a string, but the implementation only replaces space characters (' ') with an empty string. This means that other whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other forms of whitespace will remain in the string.

For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the output would still contain the tab and newline characters, which does not meet the requirement of removing all whitespaces.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential whitespace cases.
