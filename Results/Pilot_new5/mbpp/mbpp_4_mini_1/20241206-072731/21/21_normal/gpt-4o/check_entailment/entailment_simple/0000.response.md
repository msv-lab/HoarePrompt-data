Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the smallest number in a list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` is defined to take a list of numbers as its input.
2. **Finding the Minimum**: Inside the function, the `min(lst)` function is called to determine the smallest number in the list. The `min()` function is a built-in Python function specifically designed to return the minimum value from an iterable, such as a list.
3. **Output Verification**: The assertions provided check that the function returns the correct smallest number for various input lists:
   - For the input `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the smallest number is `1`, which is correctly returned.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is also `1`, which is again correctly returned.
   - For the input `[45, 46, 50, 60]`, the smallest number is `45`, which is correctly returned.

Since the function performs as required by the problem description for all tested cases and correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in a list, it satisfies the requirement of the task. Thus, the program is correct.
