The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This means that `min_diff` is now set to a very large number, indicating that it is initially greater than any possible difference that could be computed from the `arr`. The other variables `arr` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` and is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is equal to positive infinity.**
