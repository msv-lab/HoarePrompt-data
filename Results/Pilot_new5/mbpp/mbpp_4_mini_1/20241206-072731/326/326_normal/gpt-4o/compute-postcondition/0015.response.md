In the given code snippet, `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. The `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and thus `arr[i + 1]` is `arr[3]` and `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`. The value of `diff` will be the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of the sorted list.

The other variables `arr`, `n`, `min_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
