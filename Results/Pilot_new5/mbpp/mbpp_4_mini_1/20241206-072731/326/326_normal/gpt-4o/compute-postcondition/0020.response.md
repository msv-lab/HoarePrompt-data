The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0, indicating that the length of 'arr' is insufficient to compute a difference. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and its length, and return the minimum difference between consecutive elements if the length is sufficient; otherwise, it returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` (the length of `arr`), returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
