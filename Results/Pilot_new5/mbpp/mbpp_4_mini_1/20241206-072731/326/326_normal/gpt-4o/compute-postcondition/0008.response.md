The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]` and it's already specified that `diff` is less than `min_diff`, we update `min_diff` accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]` and the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`.**
