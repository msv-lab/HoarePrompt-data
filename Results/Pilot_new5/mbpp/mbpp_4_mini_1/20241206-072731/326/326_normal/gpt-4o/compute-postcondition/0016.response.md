The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The previous value of `diff` is calculated as `arr[3] - arr[2]`, which is based on the elements of the sorted list `arr`. The previous value of `min_diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`. After the assignment, `min_diff` will now hold the value of `diff`, specifically `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**.
