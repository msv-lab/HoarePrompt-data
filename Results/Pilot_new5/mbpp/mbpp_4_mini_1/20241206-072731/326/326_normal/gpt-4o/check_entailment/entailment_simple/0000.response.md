Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers, and `n`, which is the length of the array (asserted to be a positive integer).

2. **Edge Case**: The function checks if `n` is less than 2. If it is, it returns 0. This is appropriate because if there are fewer than 2 elements, a minimum difference cannot be computed.

3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted. This is crucial since the minimum difference between any two elements will be found between consecutive elements in a sorted array.

4. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the differences between consecutive elements. It maintains a variable `min_diff` to keep track of the smallest difference found. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the minimum difference between any two elements.

5. **Returning Result**: Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The assert statements provided ensure that the function behaves as expected for different test cases. The minimum difference is computed correctly based on the logic implemented in the function. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description.
