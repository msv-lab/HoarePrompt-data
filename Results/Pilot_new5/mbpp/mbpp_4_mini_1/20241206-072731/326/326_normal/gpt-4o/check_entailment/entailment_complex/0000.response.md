Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the implementation only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted version of the array. 

For example, consider the input array `(30, 5, 20, 9)`. The sorted array is `(5, 9, 20, 30)`, and the consecutive differences are `4` (between `5` and `9`), `11` (between `9` and `20`), and `10` (between `20` and `30`). The minimum difference returned by the function is `4`, which is correct for consecutive elements, but the true minimum difference between any two elements in the original array `(30, 5, 20, 9)` is `10` (between `20` and `30`).

Therefore, the logic implemented in the function fails to consider differences between non-consecutive elements, which can lead to incorrect results. The requirement is to find the minimum difference between any two elements, not just consecutive ones. Hence, the program is incorrect.
