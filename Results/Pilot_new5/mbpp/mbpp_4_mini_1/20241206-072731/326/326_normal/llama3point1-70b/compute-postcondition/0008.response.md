The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. The value of `i` is initially 1, so `arr[i]` refers to `arr[1]` and `arr[i + 1]` refers to `arr[2]`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is a positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is a positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**.
