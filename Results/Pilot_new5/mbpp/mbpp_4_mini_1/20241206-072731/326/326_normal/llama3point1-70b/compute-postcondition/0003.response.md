The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, both `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are valid integers. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is abs(arr[0] - arr[1]).**
