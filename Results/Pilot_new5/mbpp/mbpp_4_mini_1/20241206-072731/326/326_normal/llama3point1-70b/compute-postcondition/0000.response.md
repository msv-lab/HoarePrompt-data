The `arr` variable is assigned the sorted version of itself. This means that the list of integers contained in `arr` will be rearranged in non-decreasing order. The variable `target` remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer**.
