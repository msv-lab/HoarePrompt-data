Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input array has less than two elements. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. However, if the array has zero or one element, it is impossible to find a difference between two elements.

For instance:
- If we call `func_1([])`, the function will return `inf` which is not a valid output for the minimum difference.
- If we call `func_1([5])`, the function will again return `inf`.

These scenarios indicate that the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when the input array has less than two elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
