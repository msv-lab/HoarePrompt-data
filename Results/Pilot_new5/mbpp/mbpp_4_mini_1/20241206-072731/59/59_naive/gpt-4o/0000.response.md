Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It combines the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list using the built-in `sorted()` function. 

The assertions provided in the code test different scenarios with varying inputs. Each of these test cases checks that the merged list maintains the correct sorted order, and they pass successfully. Since there are no edge cases or inputs that would lead to incorrect behavior observed in the code, the implementation meets the problem requirements accurately.
