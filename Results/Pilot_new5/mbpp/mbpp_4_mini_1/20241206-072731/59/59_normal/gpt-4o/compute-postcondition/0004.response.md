Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers. It returns a sorted list formed by concatenating the three input lists. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing non-integer values; it simply combines and sorts the provided lists.**
