The variable `sorted_list` is assigned the value of `sorted(combined_list)`, which sorts the elements of `combined_list`. The state of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remains unchanged, while `combined_list` is still the concatenation of these lists. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, `sorted_list` is a sorted version of `combined_list`.**
