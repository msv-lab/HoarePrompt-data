The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Since `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers, `combined_list` will be a single list containing all the integers from these three lists in the order they appear.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will include the unchanged states of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, along with the new value of `combined_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.**
