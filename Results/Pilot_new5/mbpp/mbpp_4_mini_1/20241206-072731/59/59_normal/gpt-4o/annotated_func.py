#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns sorted_list, which is a sorted version of the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers. It returns a sorted list formed by concatenating the three input lists. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing non-integer values; it simply combines and sorts the provided lists.
