#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists that can contain any comparable elements.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list that consists of all elements from list1, list2, and list3 combined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, and returns a single sorted list that contains all elements from the three input lists combined. It does not handle cases where the input lists contain elements that are not comparable, which could lead to a `TypeError` if such elements are present.
