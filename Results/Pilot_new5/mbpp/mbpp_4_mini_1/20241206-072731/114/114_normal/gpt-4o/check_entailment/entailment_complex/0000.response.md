Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input, and it uses the `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of the specified element within the tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how it satisfies the problem description:

1. **Input Types:** The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`element`). The annotations confirm that `tup` is a tuple and `element` can be of any data type, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences:** The core functionality of the function is to count how many times `element` appears in `tup`, which is precisely what the problem asks for. The use of `tup.count(element)` accurately fulfills this requirement.

3. **Return Value:** If the `element` is not present in the tuple, the `count` method returns `0`, which is also consistent with the expected behavior mentioned in the problem description.

4. **Test Cases:** The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as effective test cases to verify that the function behaves correctly for various scenarios, including when the element is not found (which returns `0`) and when it is found multiple times.

Since the function meets all specified requirements without any flaws or exceptions, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
