To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description: finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The maximum difference can be defined as the difference between the largest and the smallest elements in the array.

2. **Function Logic**: The function uses `max(arr)` to find the largest element and `min(arr)` to find the smallest element, then it calculates the difference between these two values. This effectively gives the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Array**: If the input array `arr` is empty, calling `max(arr)` or `min(arr)` would raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to compare.
   - **Single Element Array**: If the input array contains only one element (e.g., `[5]`), the maximum difference would be `5 - 5 = 0`, which is still a valid output.
   - **All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the output should be `0`, which is also valid.

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle the case of an empty array, which would lead to a runtime error. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case of an empty array, which would cause it to raise an error instead of providing a valid output, therefore it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
