The value of `max_diff` is calculated as the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`. Since `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr` and `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, the value of `max_diff` will be the maximum integer in the list minus the minimum integer in the list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
