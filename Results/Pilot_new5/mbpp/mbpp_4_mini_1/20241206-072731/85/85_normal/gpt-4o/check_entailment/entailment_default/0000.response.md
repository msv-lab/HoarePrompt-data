The problem description states that we need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code correctly calculates the maximum difference by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then returning their difference. 

However, a crucial aspect to consider is that the code does not handle an empty list. If the input array is empty, calling `min()` and `max()` will raise a `ValueError`, which means that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

In addition, reviewing the output hints confirms that if the list is empty, the program will raise an error due to the use of `min()` and `max()` functions. This aligns with the identified edge case of not handling an empty list.

Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically when the input is an empty list), the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the edge case of an empty array, leading to an error when `min()` and `max()` are called on an empty sequence.
