The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It iterates through the list to find the index of `num`. If `num` is found, it returns the index `i` where `num` is located within `arr`. If `num` is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, indicating that `num` is absent from the list. The functionality of the function is to search for `num` in `arr` and provide its index if present, or -1 if not found.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, returning the index of `num` if it exists in `arr`, or -1 if `num` is not present. **
