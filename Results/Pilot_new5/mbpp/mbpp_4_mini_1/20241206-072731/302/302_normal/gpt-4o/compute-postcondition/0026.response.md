The variable `low` is updated to be equal to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means that `low` will now be greater than its previous value. Other variables `arr`, `target`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged in their values. Hence, the output state reflects the updated value of `low`.

Output State: **`arr` has at least one element, `target` is an integer, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.**
