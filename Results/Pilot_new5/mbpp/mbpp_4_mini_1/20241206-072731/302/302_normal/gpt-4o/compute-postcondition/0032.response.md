The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the list, or -1 if `target` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1.**
