According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Since `high` is based on the length of `arr`, which is a list of integers, `high` will be greater than or equal to 0 as long as `arr` is not empty. 

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `arr` must not be empty. Therefore, we can adjust the state to indicate that `arr` should have at least one element.

State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` is 0; `high` is `len(arr) - 1`**
