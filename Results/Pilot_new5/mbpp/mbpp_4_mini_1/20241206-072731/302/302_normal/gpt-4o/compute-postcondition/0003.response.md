The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which calculates the midpoint index between `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, the value of `mid` will be `(0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` is 0; `high` is `len(arr) - 1; `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
