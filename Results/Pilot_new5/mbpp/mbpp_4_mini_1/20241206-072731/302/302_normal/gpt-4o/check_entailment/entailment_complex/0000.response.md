Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the requirements set forth in the problem description, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function is designed to work with a sorted array. The binary search algorithm employed in the implementation is appropriate for this context, as it efficiently narrows down the search for the target value.

2. **First Occurrence**: The function specifically checks for the first occurrence of the target by modifying the `high` pointer when the target is found. Instead of returning immediately, it continues searching in the left half of the array (by setting `high = mid - 1`), which allows it to find the first occurrence even if there are duplicates.

3. **Return Values**: The function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the target if it exists. If the target is not in the array, it returns `-1`, which adheres to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The annotations specify that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty list, returning `-1` in such cases, which further affirms that the implementation is robust and adheres to the problem requirements.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions included in the program serve as tests that verify the correctness of the function for specific cases, indicating that it has been tested and behaves as expected.

Overall, the program follows the problem description precisely and efficiently handles the task of finding the first occurrence of a target in a sorted array.
