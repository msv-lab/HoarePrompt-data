Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that it should find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the loop used in the function iterates through the entire array and returns the index of the first match found, which could lead to incorrect results in cases where the number appears multiple times in the sorted array.

Consider the following test case:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
num = 2
```

In this case, the function will return `1`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `2`. However, the function's current implementation does not ensure that it specifically finds the first occurrence in the context of a sorted array, as it simply returns the first match it encounters. If the input were to be a sorted array with duplicates like `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and you searched for `1`, it would return `0`, which is correct. But if we consider larger sorted arrays with multiple occurrences of the same number, the algorithm does not guarantee the identified index is the first occurrence in all scenarios.

Moreover, binary search would be a more suitable approach for this problem since it operates on a sorted array and efficiently finds the first occurrence of a number.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement for all input cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
