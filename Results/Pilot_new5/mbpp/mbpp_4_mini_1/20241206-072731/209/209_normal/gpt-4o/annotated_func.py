#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of sublists, where each sublist is non-empty.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-empty sublists and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any of the sublists in the input list were empty, a potential IndexError would occur, but the function assumes all sublists are non-empty based on the provided context.
