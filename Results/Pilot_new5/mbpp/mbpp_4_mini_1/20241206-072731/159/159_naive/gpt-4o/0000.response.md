Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the program should find the volume of a cone, but the implementation of the function `func_1` is not aligned with the expectations. The function is defined after the assertions, which implies that `func_1` must be defined before it is called in the assertions. This will lead to a `NameError` because the function does not exist at the time of the assertions.

Additionally, the assertions themselves are checking for specific outputs, but if the function is not defined correctly beforehand, the program will fail before reaching the point of checking the values it computes for the volume of a cone.

To illustrate a potential case where the program does not work:
- Trying to run the assertions will raise a `NameError` since `func_1` is not defined at that time.

Thus, the program does not work as expected in the provided problem description.
