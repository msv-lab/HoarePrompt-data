Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the volume of a cone based on the provided problem description. It uses the formula for the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). 

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are stated to be non-negative floats or integers. The return value of the function is computed using the correct mathematical formula for the volume of a cone:

1. The function multiplies the square of the radius by the height.
2. It then multiplies the result by \( \pi \).
3. Finally, it divides the final result by 3 to produce the volume.

The assertions in the provided code verify that the function returns the correct volume for given test cases, demonstrating that it behaves as expected for positive inputs.

One important point noted in the annotations is that the function does not handle negative or invalid inputs but states it will return a valid volume as long as both inputs are non-negative. This indicates that the function operates correctly within the specific constraints outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description effectively, confirming its correctness.
