#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are positive numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone calculated as 1/3 times pi times radius squared times height, where radius and height are positive numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both expected to be positive numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, the function does not include any error handling for cases where `radius` or `height` may not be positive, which could lead to potentially incorrect results if negative values are passed.
