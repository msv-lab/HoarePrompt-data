Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the radius or height is negative. According to the mathematical definition of the volume of a cone, both the radius and height must be non-negative values. If the function is called with a negative radius or height, it will still compute a volume but that volume would be incorrect as it doesn't conform to the physical constraints of the problem. For example:

- `func_1(-5, 12)` would compute a volume, but this is not valid as the radius cannot be negative.
- `func_1(5, -12)` would also compute a volume, which is again invalid.

Thus, since the program does not handle these potential cases, it is incorrect.
