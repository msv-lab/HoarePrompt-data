Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element in the input list. If an element is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that element to flatten it further, and then extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to `flat_list`. 

This logic effectively handles various cases, including:
1. A fully nested list (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]]]`).
2. An empty list (e.g., `[]`), which will return an empty list.
3. A flat list with no nesting (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), which will return the same list.

There are no potential edge cases or examples where the code fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, it can be concluded that the implementation is correct.
