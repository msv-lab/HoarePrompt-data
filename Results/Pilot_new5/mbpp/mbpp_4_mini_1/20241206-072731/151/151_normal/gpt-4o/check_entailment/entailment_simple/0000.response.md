Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle lists that may be nested to any level. It checks each item in the input `nested_list`. If the item is itself a list, the function calls itself on that item, effectively flattening it.

2. **Base Case**: If the item is not a list (i.e., a single integer), it simply appends that item to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all non-list items are included in the final output.

3. **Accurate Output**: The assertions provided in the annotated code serve as test cases, and they confirm that the function produces the expected flattened list for various nested structures. The expected output matches the actual output from the function for all given test cases.

4. **Handles Empty Lists**: The function also correctly handles empty lists, returning an empty list as specified in the comments.

Overall, the recursive nature of the function allows it to handle any combination of integers and lists, including deeply nested structures, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.
