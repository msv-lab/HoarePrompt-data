The `flat_list` is an empty list initially, and we have `nested_list` which contains at least 3 items. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the third item in `nested_list`. 

The code `flat_list.append(item)` appends the value of `item` to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` was initially empty, after this operation, it will contain one item, which is the third item from `nested_list`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains the third item of `nested_list`, `nested_list` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.**
