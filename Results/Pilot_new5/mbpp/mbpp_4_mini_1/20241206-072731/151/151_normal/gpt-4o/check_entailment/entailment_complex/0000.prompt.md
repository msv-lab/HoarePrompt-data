You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and can be nested to any level.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may contain integers or other lists, or a combination of both. The length of `flat_list` depends on the total number of non-list elements and the elements returned by `func_1` applied to any sublists. `nested_list` is unchanged from its initial state. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be an empty list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may contain integers or other lists, or a combination of both, depending on the total number of non-list elements and the elements returned by `func_1` applied to any sublists. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a potentially nested list `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both. It returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements from `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, it returns an empty list. The function correctly handles any level of nesting and does not alter the original `nested_list`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
