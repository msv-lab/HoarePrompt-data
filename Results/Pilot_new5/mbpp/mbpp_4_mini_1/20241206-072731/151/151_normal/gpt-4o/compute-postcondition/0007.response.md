According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 items, the loop executes again for the second item. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item, and `item` is the first item in `nested_list`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `item` should be the second item in `nested_list`.

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`**
