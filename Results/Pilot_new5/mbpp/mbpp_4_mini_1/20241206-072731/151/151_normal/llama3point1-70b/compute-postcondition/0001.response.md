According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element. Since `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list, it does not influence the execution condition of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will hold the current element of `nested_list`. So for the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must have at least 1 element, and `i` should correspond to the first element in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
