Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why the program always meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `nested_list`, which is intended to be a list that can contain other lists or non-list elements. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the input can be nested to any depth.

2. **Recursion for Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle lists within the input list. When an element of `nested_list` is itself a list (`if type(i) == list:`), it recursively calls `func_1(i)` to flatten that sublist. This ensures that any level of nested lists is processed correctly, consistent with the problem's requirement to handle nesting of any depth.

3. **Appending Non-List Elements**: For elements that are not lists, the function appends them directly to `flat_list`. This ensures that all non-list elements from the original nested structure are included in the final flattened output.

4. **Empty Input Handling**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list (`flat_list`). This behavior is explicitly mentioned in both the comments and the problem description.

5. **Output**: The function returns `flat_list`, which is a flat version of the original nested list, containing all non-list elements. This matches the requirement to return a flattened structure.

In summary, the program consistently fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description by correctly flattening any nested list structure, handling all specified edge cases, and providing the expected output.
