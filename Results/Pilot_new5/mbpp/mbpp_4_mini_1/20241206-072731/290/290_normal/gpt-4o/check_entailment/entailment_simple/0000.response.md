The provided program aims to check if a string contains the character 'z', but only if it is not located at the start or the end of the string. Let's analyze the program against the problem description.

1. The program uses the slice `s[1:-1]` to check for the presence of 'z' between the first and last characters of the string. This correctly aligns with the requirement to check for 'z' not at the start or the end of the word.

2. The function returns `True` if 'z' is found in the substring `s[1:-1]`.

3. The function returns `False` if 'z' is not found in that substring, which covers the case where 'z' might be at the start or end or simply not present in the string at all.

4. The assertions in the provided code also seem to align with the expected behavior:
   - `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present and not at the start or end.
   - `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start.
   - `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present.

5. However, the program will fail for strings that contain 'z' at the start or end but still contain 'z' elsewhere. For example, the string `'zabc'` should return `True` because 'z' is present in the substring, but it would return `False` since it is at the start. This is an important aspect of the problem description that the program overlooks.

Considering all these points, the program does not fully satisfy the problem description as it fails in cases where 'z' is at the start and present elsewhere in the string. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
