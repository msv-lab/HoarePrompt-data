To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we must assess whether the function `func_1` fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function must check if a string contains the character 'z', but not at the start or the end of the string.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string `s`.
  
2. **Return Values**:
   - If 'z' is found in `s[1:-1]`, the function returns `True`.
   - If 'z' is not found in `s[1:-1]`, it returns `False`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This should return `True` because 'z' is present in the substring from index 1 to index -1 (i.e., "ythonzabc").
   - `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: This should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string and thus does not satisfy the condition.
   - `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This should return `False` because there is no 'z' in the substring " lang ", which excludes the spaces at the start and end.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- If the string length is 1, `s[1:-1]` will be an empty string, and hence will return `False`, which is correct.
- If the string length is 2, `s[1:-1]` will also be an empty string, again returning `False`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly checks for the presence of 'z' while excluding the first and last characters of the string. Thus, it aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
