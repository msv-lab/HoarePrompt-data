The variable `words` is assigned the result of `s.split()`, which splits the string `s` into a list of words based on whitespace. Since `s` is a string with at least one character, `words` will be a list containing one or more elements (the words in the string). The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s`.**
