According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `words`. If `words` contains at least one word, the loop will execute. Given that `s` is a string with at least one character, it suggests that `words` has been derived from `s` and is likely to contain at least one word. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the conditions are that `words` must have at least one word, and the variable `word` will take the value of the first word in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**
