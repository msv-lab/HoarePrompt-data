Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if any word in `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' within its internal characters (i.e., excluding the first and last characters). If no such words exist, the function returns `False`. The function does not check if the entire string `s` has a length greater than 1; it solely evaluates each individual word in the string. **
