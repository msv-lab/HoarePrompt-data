Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s`, `word` is the last word in the list or no `word` if `words` is empty. If there are any words with length greater than 1 that contain the letter 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last character, the function would have returned True during the iterations; otherwise, the function does not return anything.**
