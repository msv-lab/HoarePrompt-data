According to the code, the loop can execute again if the list `words` has more words to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we have a string `s` that has at least one character, which gives us a list of words in `words` that must have at least 1 word. Currently, `word` is the first word in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure there is at least one more word in `words` to iterate over. 

Assuming that `word` is currently the first word in a list of at least 2 words, the next `word` in the iteration will be the second word in the list. Therefore, the updated state should reflect that `word` is now the second word in the list, and since `words` originally had at least 1 word, it must now have at least 2 words for the loop to continue.

State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s` that must have at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list.**
