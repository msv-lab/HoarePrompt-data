To determine the correctness of the program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the provided function and the requirements.

Problem description: Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Program:
```python
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

### Analysis:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which effectively excludes the first and the last character of the string.
   - If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Examples**:
   - For the string `'pythonzabc.'`, `s[1:-1]` evaluates to ` 'ythonzabc'`, which contains 'z', so the result is `True`. This matches the expected outcome.
   - For the string `'zxyabc.'`, `s[1:-1]` evaluates to `'xyabc'`, which does not contain 'z', so the result is `False`. This also matches the expected outcome.
   - For the string `'  lang  .'`, `s[1:-1]` evaluates to `' lang '` which does not contain 'z', therefore returning `False`. This too matches the expected outcome.

### Edge Cases:
However, we have to consider edge cases that could potentially break the logic:
- What if the string is very short, like a single character or two characters?
   - For example:
     - If `s = 'z'`, then `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string (`''`). The function should correctly return `False`, and it does.
     - If `s = 'az'`, then `s[1:-1]` would also be an empty string (`''`). The function should return `False`, which it does.
     - If `s = 'za'`, then `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string (`''`). The function should return `False`, which it does.
     - If `s = 'zz'`, then `s[1:-1]` would also be an empty string (`''`). The function should return `False`, which it does.

### Conclusion:
All the tested inputs, including edge cases, are handled correctly by the function. There are no cases where the function yields an incorrect result based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly checks for the presence of 'z' in the string but excludes the start and end characters, and it handles all relevant edge cases.
