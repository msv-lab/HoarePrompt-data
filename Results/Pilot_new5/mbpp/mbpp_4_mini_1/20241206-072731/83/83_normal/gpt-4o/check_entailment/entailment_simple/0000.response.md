Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that sorts a list of elements. Instead, the program sorts the list in non-increasing order (from largest to smallest), which is not what is typically expected when sorting unless specified otherwise. The standard sorting order is non-decreasing (from smallest to largest). 

Furthermore, there is no indication that the function parameters and the use of the `arr` variable within the helper functions (`flip` and `find_max_index`) are properly handling the scope of the `arr` variable since it is not passed as an argument to these functions. This could lead to potential errors if the program were executed.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the sorting functionality defined in the problem description. It sorts in reverse order instead of the expected ascending order and has a scope issue that would prevent it from functioning correctly in practice.
