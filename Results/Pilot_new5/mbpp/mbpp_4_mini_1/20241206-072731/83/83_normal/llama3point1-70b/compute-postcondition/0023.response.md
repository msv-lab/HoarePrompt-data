The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other. After executing the function body, if the length of `arr` is 0, the function returns an unchanged and empty list. If the length of `arr` is greater than 0, the function returns the sorted version of `arr` in non-decreasing order, which may have been modified through a loop executed `n` times. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return it sorted in non-decreasing order or unchanged if it is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list arr and returns the sorted array in non-decreasing order if arr is not empty; if arr is empty, it returns an unchanged empty list.**
