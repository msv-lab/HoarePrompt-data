The code snippet reverses the sublist of `arr` from the start up to and including the element at `max_index`. This operation does not affect the other variables directly, but it modifies the contents of `arr`. 

Given that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, the length of the reversed sublist is `max_index + 1`, which will affect the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr`. The specific values of `arr`, `n`, `size`, and `max_index` were not provided, but we know that `n` is greater than 0 and `size` is `n - 1`.

The output will reflect the update to the list `arr`, while the values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` has the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`**.
