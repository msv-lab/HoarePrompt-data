Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` within the first `size` elements. If `max_index` is not 0, then the elements of `arr` up to and including the maximum element at index `max_index` are reversed.***
