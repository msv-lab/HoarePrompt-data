According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `size` will start at `n` and decrement down to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. At the beginning of the first iteration, `size` will equal `n`. 

To summarize, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `size` is initialized to `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
