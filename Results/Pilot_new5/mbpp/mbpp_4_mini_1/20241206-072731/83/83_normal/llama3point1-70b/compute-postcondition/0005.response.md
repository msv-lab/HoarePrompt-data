The code reverses the elements of `arr` from the start of the list up to the index `max_index`, inclusive. The original list `arr` is modified in such a way that the sublist from `arr[0]` to `arr[max_index]` is reversed. The value of `n`, `size`, and the current values of `max_index` remain unchanged, while the list `arr` is updated.

Output State: **`arr` is updated with the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `size` elements, and the current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1, and the current value of `max_index` is also not equal to 0.**
