Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `size` elements. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, then `arr` is updated with the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` reversed, while preserving the conditions that `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` or 0.***
