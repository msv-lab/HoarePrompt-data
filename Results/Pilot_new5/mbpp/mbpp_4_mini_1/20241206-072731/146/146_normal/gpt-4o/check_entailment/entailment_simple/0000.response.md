Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` intends to find the longest sublist within a list of lists and return its length and the sublist itself. However, the assertions provided in the annotation do not match the expected outputs.

For example:
- The first assertion `func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])` expects the output `(3, [13, 15, 17])`, but the longest sublist `[13, 15, 17]` has a length of 3, which is correct. However, this assertion is misleading because the output format appears to specify the length of the longest sublist incorrectly as 3, when it should be 3 (the length of the longest sublist) and the longest sublist itself `[13, 15, 17]`.

The second and third assertions follow the same incorrect format, indicating that the expected length is not matching the actual length of the longest sublists.

In summary, the function is correct in its logic to find the longest sublist and returns its length and the sublist, but the assertions in the annotated program do not correctly validate this, contributing to the overall incorrectness of the program concerning the problem description. Therefore, the function does not consistently produce the expected output as per the given problem description.
