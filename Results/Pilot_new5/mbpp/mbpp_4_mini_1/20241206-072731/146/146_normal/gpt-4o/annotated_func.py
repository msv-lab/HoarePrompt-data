#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` remains 0 and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and max_list, which is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then max_len is 0 and max_list is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sublists and returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list. The function effectively finds the longest sublist by comparing lengths, and it correctly handles the case of an empty input list, ensuring that it returns appropriate default values.
