The provided program is designed to find the maximum length of sublists in a list of lists and return the maximum length along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. Let's analyze the program step-by-step against the problem description.

1. **Finding Maximum Length**: The program correctly computes the maximum length of the sublists using `max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`. This aligns with the requirement to find the maximum length among the sublists.

2. **Finding Sublists with Maximum Length**: The program uses a list comprehension to collect sublists that match the maximum length calculated. This part is also aligned with the requirement as it seeks to gather those sublists that have the maximum length.

3. **Returning Results**: The function returns both the maximum length and the first sublist from the collected maximum length sublists. However, the return statement `return max_len, max_sublists[0]` means that it only provides the first sublist of maximum length and does not return the list of all maximum length sublists, which contradicts the problem description stating that a list of maximum length should be returned.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the input list is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to compute the maximum length. This is acceptable behavior and is in line with the expectations that there can be corner cases.

Given these points, the program does not fully comply with the problem description because it does not return the entire list of sublists that have the maximum length, only the first one.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The primary reason is that the program does not return all sublists of maximum length as required by the problem description, but only the first one.
