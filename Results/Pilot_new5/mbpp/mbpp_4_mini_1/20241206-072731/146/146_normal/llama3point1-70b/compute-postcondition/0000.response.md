The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists`. The length of each sublist is calculated using `len(sublist)`, and the maximum value is determined using the `max()` function. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.**
