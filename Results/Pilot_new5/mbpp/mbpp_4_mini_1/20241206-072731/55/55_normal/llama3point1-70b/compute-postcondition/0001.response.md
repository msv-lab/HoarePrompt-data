The code creates a new string `camel_case_str` by joining the capitalized versions of each word in the list `words`. The variable `words` is derived from the initial state of `snake_case_str`, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores. After this operation, `camel_case_str` will be a concatenation of the capitalized words without any underscores. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string that consists of lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `snake_case_str` by underscores; `camel_case_str` is a string that is the concatenation of the capitalized words from `words`.**
