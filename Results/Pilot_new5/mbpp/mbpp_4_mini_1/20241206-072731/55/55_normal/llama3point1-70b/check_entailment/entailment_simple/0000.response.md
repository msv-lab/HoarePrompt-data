Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the conversion from snake case to camel case. The issue is that while it capitalizes the first letter of each word, it does not handle the first word appropriately according to camel case conventions. In camel case, the first word should remain in lowercase. 

For example, if the input is `snake_case_string`, the expected output should be `snakeCaseString`, but the current implementation will return `SnakeCaseString`, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
