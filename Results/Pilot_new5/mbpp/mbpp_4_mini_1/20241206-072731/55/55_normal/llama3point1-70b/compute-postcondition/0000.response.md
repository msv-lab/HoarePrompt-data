The `words` variable is assigned the value of `snake_case_str.split('_')`, which splits the string at each underscore and creates a list of words. Since `snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, `words` will be a list containing the individual words derived from that string. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string that consists of lowercase letters and underscores, where words are separated by underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `snake_case_str` by underscores.**
