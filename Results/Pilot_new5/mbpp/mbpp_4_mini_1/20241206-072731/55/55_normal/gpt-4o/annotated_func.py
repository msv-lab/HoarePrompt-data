#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string consisting of lowercase letters, underscores, and may not be empty.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the components of 'snake_str', where each component is capitalized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `snake_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits the string into components at the underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a new string formed by joining these capitalized components without any spaces or underscores. If `snake_str` contains only underscores or is empty, the behavior may not be fully defined since the input should be non-empty according to the precondition.
