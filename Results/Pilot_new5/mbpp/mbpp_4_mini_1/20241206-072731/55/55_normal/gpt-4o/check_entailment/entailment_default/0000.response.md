The provided function `func_1` is designed to convert a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string at underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together.

### Initial Assessment:
Looking at the code and problem description, the function generally seems to follow the requirements. It correctly handles strings that are valid snake case by splitting the string on underscores and capitalizing each segment. The result is then joined into a single string without any underscores, which matches the definition of camel case.

However, there are potential edge cases that may not be explicitly handled:
1. An input string that is empty (although the precondition states non-empty).
2. An input string that has leading or trailing underscores, such as `_python_program` or `python_program_`.
3. An input string that contains multiple consecutive underscores, such as `python__program`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a non-empty string, which implies that the function should not handle empty strings. It also mentions that if there are only underscores or if the string is empty, behavior may not be defined. This aligns with the code since the function would fail or behave unexpectedly if it received such input.

### Conclusion:
Given that:
- The function does not handle the case of multiple consecutive underscores or leading/trailing underscores appropriately, which can lead to unintended capitalization and incorrect output (for example, `python__program` would yield `PythonProgram` instead of `PythonProgram`, essentially ignoring the empty string between underscores).
- The function does not check for empty input or input that consists solely of underscores.

Due to these issues, the function fails to meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle edge cases such as leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores correctly, resulting in potential output errors.
