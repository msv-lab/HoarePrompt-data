Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly convert snake case strings to camel case strings. While it capitalizes the first letter of each word, it does not handle the case where the first word should not be capitalized in camel case. In camel case, the first word should start with a lowercase letter, while subsequent words should start with an uppercase letter. For example, the input 'python_program' should yield 'pythonProgram', but the program incorrectly returns 'PythonProgram'.

The implementation of the function `func_1` incorrectly capitalizes the first letter of the first component. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description to convert the input string from snake case to camel case.

Thus, the program does not do what the problem description asks for all potential cases.
