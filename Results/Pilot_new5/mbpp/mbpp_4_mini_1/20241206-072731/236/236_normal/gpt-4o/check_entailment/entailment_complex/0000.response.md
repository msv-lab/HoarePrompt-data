The provided program is a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's analyze the program in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description
- The function must determine if a given list is sorted.

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function iterates through the list `lst` using a for loop and compares adjacent elements. 
   - If it finds any pair of elements where the first is greater than the second (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program implicitly handles empty lists and lists with a single element by returning `True`, as there are no adjacent elements to compare.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies:
     - An empty list as sorted (returns `True`).
     - A list with one element as sorted (returns `True`).
     - Lists that are sorted in non-decreasing order (returns `True`).
     - Lists that contain elements in a non-sorted order (returns `False`).

4. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided demonstrate that the function is expected to return `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted lists. 
   - The given examples in the assertions are consistent with the logic implemented in the function.

### Conclusion
The function correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It checks whether the specified list is sorted and returns the appropriate boolean value based on that check.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **True**
