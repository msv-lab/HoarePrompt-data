Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the original list `nums` to its sorted version obtained through the `sorted()` function. The equality check (`nums == sorted(nums)`) will return `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. This approach handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty list (which is considered sorted).
2. A list with one element (which is also considered sorted).
3. A list with elements in ascending order, descending order, and various combinations of elements.

Since I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not meet the requirement of determining if the list is sorted, I conclude that the program is correct.
