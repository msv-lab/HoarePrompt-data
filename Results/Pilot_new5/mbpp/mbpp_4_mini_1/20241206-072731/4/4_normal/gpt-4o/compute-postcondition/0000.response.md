The variable `xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`, which is the bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`. The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are integers, but the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the result of the XOR operation. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`**.
