To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. 

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation between two numbers results in a number that has bits set to `1` for each position where the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` differ.
2. **Power of Two Check**: The expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks whether `xor_result` is a power of two. This is true if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`, meaning that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function returns `True` if the result of the XOR operation between them is a power of two and not zero; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Checking for Edge Cases
The following cases should be examined:
- **Input with the same numbers**: For example, `func_1(0, 0)`. The result should be `False` since they do not differ at any bit position.
- **Input differing at more than one bit**: For example, `func_1(3, 1)` (which is `11` and `01` in binary, differing at two bit positions). The result should be `False`.
- **Input differing at exactly one bit**: For example, `func_1(2, 3)` (which is `10` and `11` in binary, differing at one bit position). The result should be `True`.

### Confirming Output Hints
The examples provided in the `assert` statements do seem to follow the expected logic:
- `func_1(13, 9)` results in `True` (differing at one bit).
- `func_1(15, 8)` results in `False` (differing at multiple bits).
- `func_1(2, 4)` results in `False` (differing at multiple bits).
- `func_1(2, 3)` results in `True` (differing at one bit).
- `func_1(5, 1)` results in `True` (differing at one bit).
- `func_1(1, 5)` results in `True` (differing at one bit).

### Conclusion
The program does follow the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles edge cases correctly. There is no scenario where it fails to meet the specification for the inputs examined.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately checks whether two integers differ at exactly one bit position using the XOR operation and the properties of binary numbers.
