#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating that they differ by exactly one power of two, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1 (indicating they differ by exactly one power of two); otherwise, it returns False. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation.
