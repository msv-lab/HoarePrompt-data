Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in that tuple. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function meets the description:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts a parameter `strings`, which is specified as a tuple of strings.
2. **Output Requirement**: The output is intended to be a list of the last characters from each string in the input tuple.
3. **Implementation**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and retrieves the last character `s[-1]`. This adheres to the requirement of extracting the rear index element.

The function does not encounter any cases where it would fail to meet the problem requirements, assuming that all strings in the tuple are non-empty. If there are empty strings in the tuple, an IndexError would occur, which is a limitation not addressed in the problem description. However, since the problem description does not specify constraints regarding empty strings, we can assume the context of valid input. Thus, overall, the implementation is correct given the stated requirements.
