The program provided is meant to extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. Here is the analysis of the code in relation to the problem description and the output hints provided.

### Initial Assessment:
The code:
```python
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
```
This code indeed attempts to extract the last character of each string in the provided tuple. However, it does not handle the case of empty strings. If any string in the tuple is empty, accessing `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. Hence, while the code attempts to fulfill the requirement, it fails to account for the possibility of empty strings, which is an important edge case.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
> The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will raise an IndexError since it attempts to access the last character of that string.

This statement agrees with the code as it accurately describes the behavior of the function, particularly in relation to empty strings.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when it encounters empty strings. Because of this flaw, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle empty strings appropriately and will raise an `IndexError`. For instance, if the input is `('', 'abc')`, the function will raise an error instead of returning a valid output.
