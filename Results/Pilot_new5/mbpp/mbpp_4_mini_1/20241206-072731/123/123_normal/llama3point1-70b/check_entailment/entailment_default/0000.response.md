The program provided is designed to split a list into two parts based on the given integer `L`, where the first part contains the first `L` elements and the second part contains the rest of the elements. 

Looking at the code:

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Basic functionality**: The code correctly slices the list into two parts using the slicing feature of Python. 
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is 0: The first part will be an empty list `[]`, and the second part will be the entire list `lst`. This is valid.
   - If `L` is equal to the length of the list: The first part will be the entire list `lst`, and the second part will be an empty list `[]`. This is also valid.
   - If `L` is greater than the length of the list: Python's slicing will not raise an error; it will return the entire list for the first part and an empty list for the second part. However, this situation may not be explicitly covered in the problem description.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that the function accepts a list and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple of the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list. The hints also mention that it handles the cases of `L` being 0 or equal to the length of the list correctly.

The hints imply that:
- For `L = 0`: Returns `([], lst)`
- For `L = len(lst)`: Returns `(lst, [])`
- For `L > len(lst)`: Returns `(lst, [])` (though this isn't explicitly stated).

### Conclusion:
Considering all cases, it can be seen that while the code functions correctly for `L` values of 0 and equal to length, the behavior for `L` greater than the length of the list is not described in the problem statement. However, Python slicing accommodates this case without an error, making the function robust for all potential cases.

Since the code correctly handles all specified inputs including edge cases as per Python's list slicing behavior, we conclude that the program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
