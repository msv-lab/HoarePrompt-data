The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and the parameter `L` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the elements from index `L` to the end of the list `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return a tuple containing the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list starting from index `L`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of `lst` and the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
