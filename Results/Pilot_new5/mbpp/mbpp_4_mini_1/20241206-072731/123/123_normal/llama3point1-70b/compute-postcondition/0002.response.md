Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of `lst` and the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. It correctly handles cases where `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list, returning an empty list for the first part or the entire list for the second part, respectively.**
