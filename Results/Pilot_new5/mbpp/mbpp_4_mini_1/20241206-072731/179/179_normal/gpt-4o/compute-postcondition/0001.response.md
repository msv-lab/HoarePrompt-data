The variable `cube_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the cubes of each element in the `even_numbers` list. The `even_numbers` list contains the first `n` even numbers, which can be expressed as [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]. Therefore, the elements of `even_numbers` are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n`, and we can calculate the cubes of these numbers.

The sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers can be calculated as follows:
- The cubes of the even numbers are: \(2^3, 4^3, 6^3, \ldots, (2n)^3\) or more generally \((2k)^3\) for \(k = 1\) to \(n\).
- Thus, the sum can be expressed as: 
\[ 
\text{cube\_sum} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k)^3 = 8 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 
\]
Using the formula for the sum of cubes, we know that 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 
\]
Therefore, 
\[
\text{cube\_sum} = 8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 
\]

In summary, `cube_sum` is derived from `even_numbers`, which is defined based on `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list of the first `n` even numbers: [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]; `cube_sum` is equal to \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\)**.
