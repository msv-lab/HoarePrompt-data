The provided problem description states that we need to write a function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The program does this by computing the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`.

Here's the analysis based on the code and the description:

1. The function `func_1(n)` uses a generator expression to iterate from 2 to `n * 2` in steps of 2 (thereby capturing all even numbers up to `n * 2`). It correctly computes the cube of each even number and sums them up.

2. For the case when `n = 0`, the generator expression will not produce any numbers, leading to `sum()` returning 0, which is correct as per the requirement that the result should be 0 when `n` is 0.

Now, let's check the output hints: 
- The output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`, which is indeed correctly represented in the code. 

The code follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases:
- For any non-negative integer `n`, it correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Since I cannot find any case where the function does not operate as expected and the output hints agree with the code, I conclude that the code is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers and handles the edge case of `n = 0` properly by returning 0. All conditions outlined in the problem description are met by the implementation.
