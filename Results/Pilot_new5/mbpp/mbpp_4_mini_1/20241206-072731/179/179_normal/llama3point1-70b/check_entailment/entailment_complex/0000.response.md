Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n. 

2. **Range in the Code**: The function `func_1` uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` to iterate over even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`. The `range` function here generates even numbers only, as it starts at 2 and increments by 2.

3. **Cubing the Even Numbers**: Inside the `sum()` function, the expression `i ** 3` calculates the cube of each even number in the specified range.

4. **Summation**: The `sum()` function then adds all these cubes together, fulfilling the requirement to find the cube sum.

5. **Edge Case**: When `n` is 0, the range becomes `range(2, 1, 2)`, which results in an empty range. The sum of an empty sequence is 0, which correctly matches the expectation that the cube sum for `n = 0` should be 0.

Overall, the function behaves as required in all described scenarios, thus confirming it meets the problem description's requirements.
