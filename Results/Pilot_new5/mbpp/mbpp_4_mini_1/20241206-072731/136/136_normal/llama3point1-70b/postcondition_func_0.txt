The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty, an empty dictionary is returned. The function does not handle any specific edge cases such as non-integer values or types for `d` other than a dictionary with comparable values.
