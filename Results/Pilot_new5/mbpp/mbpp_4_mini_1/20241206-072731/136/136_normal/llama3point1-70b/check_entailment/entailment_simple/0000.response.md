Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as arguments. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

- The condition `if v >= n` ensures that only entries with values satisfying the requirement are included in the result.
- The function will work correctly for any dictionary with comparable values (e.g., integers, floats) and any integer `n`, as stated in the problem description.

Thus, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description and behaves as expected for all potential cases.
