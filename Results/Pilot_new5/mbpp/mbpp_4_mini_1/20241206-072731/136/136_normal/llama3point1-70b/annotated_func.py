#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where values are comparable to integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 'd' where the values are greater than or equal to the integer 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty, an empty dictionary is returned. The function does not handle any specific edge cases such as non-integer values or types for `d` other than a dictionary with comparable values.
