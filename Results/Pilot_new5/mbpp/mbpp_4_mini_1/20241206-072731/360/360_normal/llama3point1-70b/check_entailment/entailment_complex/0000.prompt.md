You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the inner list from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numerical elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats) and returns the inner list with the maximum sum of its elements. If the input list is empty, the behavior is not defined, and it may raise a ValueError due to the use of `max()`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
