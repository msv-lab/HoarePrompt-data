Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list `lists` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, if `lists` is empty, calling `max(lists, key=sum)` will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to compare. 

The program's behavior in this scenario is not defined, which means it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it fails to be considered correct.
