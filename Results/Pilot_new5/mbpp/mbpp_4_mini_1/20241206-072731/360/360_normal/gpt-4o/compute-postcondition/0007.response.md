Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 inner list, and `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`.***
