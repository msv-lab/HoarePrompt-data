According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. The loop iterates over the inner lists within `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists. 

If the loop has executed for the first inner list, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the second inner list. Assuming that the loop has processed the first inner list already, the next sublist will be the second inner list.

To summarize:
- The loop will execute one more time for the second inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_sum` remains negative infinity until a larger sum is found.
- `max_list` remains an empty list until it is assigned to the current inner list when a larger sum is encountered.

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list**.
