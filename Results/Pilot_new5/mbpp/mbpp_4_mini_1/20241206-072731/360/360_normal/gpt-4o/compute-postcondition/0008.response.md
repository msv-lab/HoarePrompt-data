According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, which contains at least one inner list. The variable `sublist` is currently the first inner list in `list_of_lists`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, and `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sublist` must move to the next inner list. Given that `list_of_lists` contains at least one inner list, we should ensure that it contains at least two inner lists for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `sublist` is now the second inner list and `list_of_lists` must have at least two inner lists for the loop to continue.

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 inner lists, and `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`**.
