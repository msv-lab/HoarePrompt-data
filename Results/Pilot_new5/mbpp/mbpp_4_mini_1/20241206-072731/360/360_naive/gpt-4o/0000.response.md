Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` aims to return the list from the list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum. In such cases, the description does not specify which one to return, and the implementation will return the first one it encounters.

For example, consider the input:
```
func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [0, 5], [5]])
```
Here, both `[3, 4]` and `[0, 5]` sum to `7`, but the function will return `[3, 4]` since it encounters that first, without a guarantee that this is the desired behavior based on the problem description.

Thus, since the program does not handle this potential case correctly, the final decision is that it is incorrect.
