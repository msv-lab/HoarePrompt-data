The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns their polar coordinates `r` (the distance from the origin, calculated as sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and `phi` (the angle in radians, calculated using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases since the function correctly computes both values based on the input coordinates.
