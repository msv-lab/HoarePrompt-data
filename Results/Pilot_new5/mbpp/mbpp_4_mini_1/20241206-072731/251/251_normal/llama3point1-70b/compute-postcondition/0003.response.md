The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns two values: `r`, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (i.e., \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)), and `phi`, which is the angle in radians calculated using the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` (i.e., \( \phi = \text{math.atan2}(y, x) \)). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept real numbers `x` and `y`, and return their polar coordinates `r` and `phi`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns their polar coordinates r (the distance from the origin) and phi (the angle in radians).**
