#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns r and theta, where theta is equal to math.atan2(y, x) and r is the radial distance calculated from the coordinates (x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts real numbers x and y representing rectangular coordinates and returns r, the radial distance from the origin, and theta, the angle in radians calculated using the atan2 function. There are no edge cases; the function correctly computes the radial distance and angle for any real input values.
