The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. The function returns two values: `r`, which is the radial distance calculated from the coordinates (x, y), and `theta`, which is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)` (the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y)). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y` representing rectangular coordinates and return their polar coordinates `r` and `theta`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns r (the radial distance from the origin) and theta (the angle in radians calculated using atan2).**
