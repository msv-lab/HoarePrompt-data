The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings. 

In Case_1, if certain conditions are met, the function returns None, indicating that no value is returned from the function. 

In Case_2, the function returns three values: the `substring`, the index of the `substring` in the `string`, and the end index (calculated as the start index plus the length of the `substring` minus one). The start index is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`, and return either None or three values related to the `substring`'s position within the `string`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both non-empty strings. It returns None under certain conditions, or it returns the `substring`, its index in the `string`, and the end index of the substring.**
