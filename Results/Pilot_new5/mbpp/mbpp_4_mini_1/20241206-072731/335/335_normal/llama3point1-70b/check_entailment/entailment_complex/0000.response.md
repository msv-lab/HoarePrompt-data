Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly returns `None` if the substring is not found within the string, it only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring. The problem description specifies that the function should find the occurrences and positions of all substrings within the string, not just the first occurrence.

In cases where the substring appears multiple times in the string, the current implementation will only yield the starting and ending indices of the first occurrence, ignoring any subsequent occurrences. Therefore, the function does not satisfy the requirement to find all occurrences and their positions as outlined in the problem description. 

For example, if the input string is `"abcabc"` and the substring is `"abc"`, the function will only return information about the first occurrence, which does not align with the expectation of finding all occurrences. 

Hence, the function does not comply with the problem statement's complete requirements.
