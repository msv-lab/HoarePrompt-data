Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should extract elementwise tuples from the given two tuples, but the program performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples.

To clarify, the problem description implies that the function should return a new tuple that consists of pairs of corresponding elements from the two input tuples. For example, given two tuples (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6), the expected output should be a tuple of pairs: ((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)).

However, the implementation returns the result of a bitwise AND operation instead, which is not what is requested. For instance, the tuples (2, 3) and (4, 5) would yield (0, 3) when using the bitwise AND operation, which does not correspond to extracting the elements in pairs.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
