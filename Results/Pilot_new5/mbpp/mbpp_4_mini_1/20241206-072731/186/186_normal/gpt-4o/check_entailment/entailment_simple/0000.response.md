The provided problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. This suggests that the function should perform some operation that involves combining the elements of both tuples in a manner related to "elementwise" processing.

Examining the annotated program:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

The function `func_1` uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that it takes each element from both tuples, performs a bitwise AND, and returns a new tuple containing the results.

Now, let's analyze the correctness based on the problem description:

1. The problem description states to "extract the elementwise and tuples," which typically would imply performing an operation that combines elements rather than performing a bitwise operation.
2. The use of the bitwise AND operator may not align with what is typically understood as "elementwise" extraction in a general sense. Moreover, the results returned by `func_1` do not represent a straightforward combination or merging of the tuples in a way that reflects the standard arithmetic or logical operations.

To demonstrate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, consider the case of the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The expected behavior according to the problem description isn't clearly defined, but if we interpret it as requiring a simple elementwise operation like addition or multiplication, the actual output from the function won't align with any clear expectation derived from the problem description.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the program does not meet the requirements set by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
