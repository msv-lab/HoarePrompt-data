Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. The implementation uses the `count` method of Python strings, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring. 

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. Multiple occurrences ('letstdlenstdporstd' counts 3).
2. A single occurrence ('truststdsolensporsd' counts 1).
3. Two occurrences ('makestdsostdworthit' counts 2).
4. A single occurrence of 'std' in a string with no other content ('stds' counts 1).
5. An empty string, which correctly returns 0.

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested cases and the potential edge cases have been considered, there are no cases where it fails to meet the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
