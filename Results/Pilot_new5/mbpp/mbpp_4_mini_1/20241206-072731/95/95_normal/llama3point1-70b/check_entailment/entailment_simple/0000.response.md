Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as an argument and utilizes the built-in string method `count()` to determine the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within the string `s`. 

This approach directly aligns with the problem requirements. The method `s.count('std')` effectively counts how many times the substring appears, and since this operation is performed on the input string `s`, it will yield the correct result for any given input.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and will produce accurate results for all potential cases where the input is a string.
