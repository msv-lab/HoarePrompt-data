Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, returning the index of the last occurrence of the element `x`. 

The test cases provided confirm the correctness of the function:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]` and element `1`, the last position is `0`.
- For the input `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and element `1`, the last position is `2`.
- For the input `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and element `3`, the last position is `3`.

Additionally, if the element is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`. 

Overall, the function handles all specified cases, including arrays with duplicates and cases where the element is not present.
