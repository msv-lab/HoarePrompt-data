According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list. Since `arr` must have at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1, meaning `i` is currently at least 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrease `i` by 1, so `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, the loop should continue to check the previous elements. 

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now `len(arr) - 2` and `arr` still needs to maintain at least 1 element, which it does since we have at least 2 elements in the array (given that `i` was `len(arr) - 1`).

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.**
