Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Iteration from the End**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array `arr` starting from the last index down to the first index. This ensures that when the target element is found, it is the last occurrence in the array, due to the way the loop is structured.

2. **Comparison with Target**: During each iteration, the program checks if the current element (at index `i`) is equal to the `target`. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index `i`, which is the last position of the `target` in the sorted array.

3. **Return -1 for Not Found**: If the loop completes without returning an index (meaning the target was not found in the array), the function returns `-1`. This indicates that the `target` is not present in the array, which is consistent with the behavior expected from a search function.

4. **Handles All Cases**: The function handles all potential cases, including:
   - When the target is present multiple times in the array.
   - When the target is present only once.
   - When the target is not present at all.
   - When the input array is empty.

Overall, the program accurately fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description, reliably returning the last position of the specified element in a sorted array.
