According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `arr` list in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. The execution of the loop depends on the index `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `len(arr) - 2`. 

Given that `arr` has at least 1 integer, it must also have at least 2 integers for the loop to continue executing. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, and we are moving to the next element in the reverse order, the new `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`, and the element at this index will be `arr[len(arr) - 2]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.**
