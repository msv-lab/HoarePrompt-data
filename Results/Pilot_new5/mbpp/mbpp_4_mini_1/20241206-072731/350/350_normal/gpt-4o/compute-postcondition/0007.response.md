According to the code, the for loop iterates over the indices of the array `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index down to 0. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. This implies that the length of `arr` is at least 2. The variable `i` corresponds to the index being accessed in the current iteration.

To determine the state for the start of the next iteration:

1. The last value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration would be the current index being processed. Since the loop goes from `len(arr) - 1` to `0`, the next value for `i` will be decremented by 1.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. If it was `0` at the end of the last iteration, it will now be `-1`, which means the loop will exit.
3. The conditions about `arr` remain the same since we are not modifying the list in this part of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, i is length of `arr` - 2**
