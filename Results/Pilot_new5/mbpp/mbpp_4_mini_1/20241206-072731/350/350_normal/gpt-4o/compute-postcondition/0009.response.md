Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. If `arr[i]` equals `x`, then the function returns `i`, which indicates that `arr` has at least 2 elements. Otherwise, the function does not execute any return statement.***
