Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; if `x` is in `arr`, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence of `x`, otherwise the loop will have executed for all elements in `arr` without finding `x`. If `x` is not found, `i` will be -1 after the loop completes.**
