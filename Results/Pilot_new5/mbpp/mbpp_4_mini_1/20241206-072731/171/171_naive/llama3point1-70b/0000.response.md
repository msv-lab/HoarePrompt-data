Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator. If `n % 2` evaluates to 1, the number is odd (which means its parity is odd), and the function returns `True`. Conversely, if `n % 2` evaluates to 0, the number is even, and the function returns `False`. 

Since the function correctly handles all possible integer inputs (positive, negative, and zero), there are no cases where it would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
