To assess the correctness of the provided Python function based on the given problem description, let's analyze the function, its logic, and the output hints:

1. **Problem description**: The task is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The expected output is `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers.

2. **Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       return n % 2 != 0
   ```

3. **Output hints**: The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer; otherwise, it returns `False` if `n` is even.

### Initial Assessment:
- The function checks if `n` is odd by evaluating `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. This logic correctly implements the requirement to find out whether the given number is odd or not.

### Checking Edge Cases:
- The function should handle all integers, including negative numbers and zero:
  - `func_1(0)` should return `False` since 0 is even.
  - `func_1(-1)` should return `True` since -1 is odd.
  - `func_1(-2)` should return `False` since -2 is even.

The function correctly processes these edge cases, returning the expected values.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function should return `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns with the function's implementation. 

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly identifies the parity of integers, including the edge cases outlined, and the output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, we can conclude that the function adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it accurately identifies whether the given integer is odd for all integers, including edge cases such as zero and negative numbers.
