#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the value of degrees multiplied by (π / 180), converting the angle in degrees to radians.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric parameter `degrees` and returns the angle in radians by converting degrees using the formula degrees multiplied by (π / 180). It does not handle any errors related to invalid input types or values, assuming that the input is always a numeric value.
