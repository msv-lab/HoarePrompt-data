Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input is not a number (e.g., strings or None). For instance, if the function `func_1` is called with a string input like `func_1("90")`, the program will raise an error instead of returning a valid output. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs, which violates the problem requirement that it should convert degrees to radians for every possible case.
