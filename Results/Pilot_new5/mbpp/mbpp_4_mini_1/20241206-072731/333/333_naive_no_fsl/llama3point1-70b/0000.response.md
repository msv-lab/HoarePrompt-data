Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the brackets `()`, `{}`, and `[]`. Here's how the code works:

1. It initializes an empty list called `stack` to keep track of opening brackets.
2. It uses a dictionary `brackets` to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. It iterates through each character in the input `expression`:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, or `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, or `]`), the function checks whether the stack is empty (which would mean there's no corresponding opening bracket) or whether the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
4. Finally, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all opening brackets were matched with closing brackets), and `False` otherwise.

The function handles various cases:
- It correctly identifies balanced expressions like `"()[]"`, `"{[()]}"`, and returns `True`.
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions like `"([)]"` or `"((("`, returning `False`.
- It also handles edge cases, such as an empty string, which is considered balanced, returning `True`.

Since I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
