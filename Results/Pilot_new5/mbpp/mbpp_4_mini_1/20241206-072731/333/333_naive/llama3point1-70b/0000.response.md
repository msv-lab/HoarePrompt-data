To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its ability to check if the given expression is balanced in terms of brackets.

The program uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and checks for matching closing brackets as it iterates through the expression. The mapping of opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets is provided in the dictionary `brackets`. Here are the steps the program follows:

1. It initializes an empty stack.
2. It iterates through each character in the expression.
3. If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it pushes it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), it checks if the stack is empty (indicating there is no matching opening bracket) or if the last opening bracket does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Now let's consider edge cases and potential failures:

- The program does not handle cases where there are characters in the expression that are not brackets. However, since the problem description does not specify that the function should ignore non-bracket characters, we can assume that such cases should also return `False`. 
- If the input expression is completely empty, the program correctly returns `True` since there are no unmatched brackets.

However, we should check if the function can handle expressions with only closing brackets correctly. For example, for the input `))}`, the function should return `False`, which it does. 

Since the provided implementation handles the main cases for balanced brackets appropriately and does not have any glaring flaws, we conclude that it will work correctly for all inputs defined by the problem description.

Therefore, the analysis leads us to the conclusion:

Correctness: **True**.
