The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all opening symbols are matched correctly with their corresponding closing symbols. The function returns `True` if all symbols are properly matched and closed; otherwise, it returns `False`. Specifically, it returns `False` if there are unmatched closing symbols or if the string is incorrectly nested. If the input string contains no symbols, it also returns `True` since there are no unmatched symbols.
