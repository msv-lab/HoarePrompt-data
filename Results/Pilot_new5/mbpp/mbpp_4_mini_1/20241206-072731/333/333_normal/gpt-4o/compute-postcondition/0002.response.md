According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expr` variable. For the loop to execute, `expr` must contain at least one character. The `stack` starts as an empty list, so it does not require any adjustments at the start of the loop. 

To summarize, we need to ensure that `expr` has at least one character for the loop to execute. Thus, we will adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`expr` is a string consisting of characters that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list**
