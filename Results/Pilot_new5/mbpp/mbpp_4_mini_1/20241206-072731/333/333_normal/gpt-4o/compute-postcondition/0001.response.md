The value of `expr` remains a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and the `stack` remains an empty list because the code does not modify them. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
