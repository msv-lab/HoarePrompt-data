Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements a function that checks if the given expression of parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Use of Stack**: The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening symbols. This is a standard approach for checking balanced parentheses, as it allows for the correct matching and nesting of symbols.

2. **Matching Pairs**: The function defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that clearly maps closing symbols to their corresponding opening symbols. This enables the function to check for correct pairing efficiently.

3. **Iterating Through Characters**: The function iterates over each character in the input string `expr`. It checks if the character is an opening symbol (and if so, pushes it onto the stack) or a closing symbol (in which case it checks if there is a corresponding opening symbol on the stack).

4. **Condition Checks**: 
   - If a closing symbol is encountered and the stack is empty, it returns `False`, indicating an unmatched closing symbol.
   - If the top of the stack does not match the expected opening symbol for the closing symbol, it returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening symbols had matching closing symbols, thus the expression is balanced, and the function returns `True`. Conversely, a non-empty stack indicates unmatched opening symbols.

Given the assertions provided before the function definition, the function has been tested for various cases, including:
- An expression that is correctly balanced (`'{()}[{}]'`), which returns `True`.
- An expression that is not balanced (`'{()}[{]'`), which returns `False`.
- Another balanced expression (`'{()}[{}][]({})'`), which also returns `True`.

These tests confirm that the function performs as expected and adheres to the problem description's requirement to determine if the expression is balanced. Therefore, the program is correct.
