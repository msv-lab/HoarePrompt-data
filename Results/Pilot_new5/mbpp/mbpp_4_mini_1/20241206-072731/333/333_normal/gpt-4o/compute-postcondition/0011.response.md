Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of characters that has at least 1 character. If `char` is in the values of `matching_pairs`, then `stack` contains the character `char`. If `char` is not a value from the `matching_pairs` dictionary, and if `char` is a key in `matching_pairs` with a non-empty stack, the top element of the stack equals `matching_pairs[char]`. Otherwise, `stack` remains empty.***
