According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. The loop iterates over each character in the `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, which means it has at least 2 characters. 

If the loop has processed some characters (let's say it processed the first character), then for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the next character in the `expression`. If the loop has processed `n` characters, then `char` would be the `(n+1)`-th character of `expression` in the next iteration.

Since the `expression` is guaranteed to have at least one more character, we deduce that the number of characters processed so far is `n`, and the next character `char` will be the `(n+1)`-th character. Thus, `char` is updated to the next character in the string. 

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in the string**
