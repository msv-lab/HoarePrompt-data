Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. If `char` is in `brackets`, it is appended to `stack`. If `char` is in `brackets.values()`, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the character popped from the stack does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, in which case it returns False. If the stack is not empty and the popped character matches `char`, the function proceeds without any action taken.***
