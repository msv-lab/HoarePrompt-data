The code snippet `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char` to the `stack`. The `stack` variable is affected by this operation, while the `expression` variable remains unchanged. The initial state indicates that `expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `char` is the next character in that string.

The output state will reflect that `char` has been added to the `stack`.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `char` is the next character in the `expression`, and `char` has been appended to `stack`.**
