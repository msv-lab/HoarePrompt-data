Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, brackets, and braces, as required by the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression. It also defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through each character in the input string `expression`. 

3. **Handling Opening Brackets**: If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists as a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the `stack`.

4. **Handling Closing Brackets**: If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it exists as a value in the `brackets` dictionary):
   - The program checks if the `stack` is empty. If it is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket, and thus it returns `False`.
   - If the `stack` is not empty, the program pops the last opening bracket from the `stack` and checks if it matches the current closing bracket using the `brackets` dictionary. If they do not match, it returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the `stack` is empty. If it is empty, it means all opening brackets were matched with closing brackets, and it returns `True`. If there are unmatched opening brackets left in the `stack`, it returns `False`.

The program correctly handles all cases involving different types of brackets, including:
- Nested brackets (e.g., `[{()}]`)
- Unmatched brackets (e.g., `[({]})`)
- Excess closing brackets (e.g., `[()]}`)

Thus, the program accurately determines whether the expression is balanced according to the specifications in the problem description.
