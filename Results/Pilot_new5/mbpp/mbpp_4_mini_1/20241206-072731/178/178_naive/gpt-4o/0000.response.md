Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list. If `func_1([])` is called, it will attempt to compute `len(numbers)` which is 0, and then `total_sum * len(numbers)` would result in a multiplication by zero. This means the function would return 0, which is not a valid sum according to the problem description, as there are no numbers to round or sum. Thus, the function fails for this input case.
