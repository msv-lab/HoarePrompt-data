The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numeric values, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, referred to as `total_sum`. The function then returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the `numbers` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numeric values and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of those numbers and the count of the numbers in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of numeric values, and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values in numbers and the length of the list.**
