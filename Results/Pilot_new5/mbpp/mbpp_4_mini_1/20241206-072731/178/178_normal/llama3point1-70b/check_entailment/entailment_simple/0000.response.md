Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers`. It applies the `round()` function to each element, which is consistent with the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: After rounding the numbers, the program computes the total sum of the rounded values using the `sum()` function. This effectively captures the requirement to find the sum of the rounded numbers.

3. **Multiplying by Length of List**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the original list `numbers` using `len(numbers)`. This matches the requirement of the problem description to return the product of the total sum and the length of the list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated value, which is expected behavior based on the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately follows the specified instructions, handling all numbers correctly and producing the expected output. Therefore, it is correct as per the stated requirements.
