Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Rounding each number**: The program uses a list comprehension, `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`, to round each number in the input list `numbers` to the nearest integer. This aligns with the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating the total sum**: The program then calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`, which is consistent with the problem's request to compute the total sum of the rounded values.

3. **Multiplying by the length of the list**: Finally, the program multiplies the `total_sum` by `len(numbers)` to get the final result, `result = total_sum * len(numbers)`. This step fulfills the requirement to multiply the total sum by the length of the list.

4. **Handling of edge cases**: The explanation specifies that if the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as both the sum and the count would be 0. This is a logical behavior, ensuring that the function handles edge cases appropriately.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description by rounding the numbers, summing them, and multiplying by the length of the input list, thus producing the correct output for all specified cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
