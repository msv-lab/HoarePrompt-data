The value of `total_sum` is assigned the total sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`. The list `rounded_numbers` contains the rounded values of each element in `numbers`. The value of `total_sum` will depend on the specific rounded values in `rounded_numbers`, but we know it will be the sum of those values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of each element in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
