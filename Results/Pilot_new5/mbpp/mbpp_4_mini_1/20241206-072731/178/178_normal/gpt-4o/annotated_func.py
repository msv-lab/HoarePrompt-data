#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of the rounded values of each element in 'numbers', and len(numbers), which is the number of elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values (either integers or floats) and returns the product of the sum of these values rounded to the nearest integer and the count of elements in the list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the sum will be 0 and the count will be 0.
