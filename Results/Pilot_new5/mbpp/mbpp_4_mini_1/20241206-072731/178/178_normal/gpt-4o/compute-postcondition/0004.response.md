The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numerical values (either integers or floats). The function calculates the sum of the rounded values of each element in `numbers`, referred to as `total_sum`, and multiplies this sum by the number of elements in the list, denoted as `len(numbers)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numerical values `numbers` and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of its elements and the count of the elements in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numerical values `numbers` and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of its elements and the count of the elements in the list.**
