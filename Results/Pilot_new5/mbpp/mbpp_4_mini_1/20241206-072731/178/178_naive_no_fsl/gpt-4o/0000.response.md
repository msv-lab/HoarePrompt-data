Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

The problem requires a function that:
1. Rounds every number in a given list.
2. Computes the total sum of the rounded numbers.
3. Multiplies the total sum by the length of the list of numbers.
4. Returns this final result.

The provided code defines the function `func_1`, which performs the following steps:
1. Rounds each number using the `round()` function.
2. Calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. Multiplies this sum by the length of the input list.
4. Returns the final result.

Now, let's test the function with various inputs to see if it adheres to the problem description:

1. For the input `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`:
   - Rounded numbers: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`
   - Total sum: `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18 = 7`
   - Length of the list: `9`
   - Result: `7 * 9 = 63`
   - Expected: `243`
   - **This case fails.**

2. For the input `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`:
   - Rounded numbers: `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`
   - Total sum: `5 + 2 + 9 + 24 + 29 = 69`
   - Length of the list: `5`
   - Result: `69 * 5 = 345`
   - Expected: `345`
   - **This case passes.**

3. For the input `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`:
   - Rounded numbers: `[25, 57, 89]`
   - Total sum: `25 + 57 + 89 = 171`
   - Length of the list: `3`
   - Result: `171 * 3 = 513`
   - Expected: `513`
   - **This case passes.**

Based on the first test case, the function does not produce the expected output as per the problem description. The computed result does not match the expected result, which leads to the conclusion that the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails for the case of rounding the numbers and computing the final result, specifically in the first test case provided.
