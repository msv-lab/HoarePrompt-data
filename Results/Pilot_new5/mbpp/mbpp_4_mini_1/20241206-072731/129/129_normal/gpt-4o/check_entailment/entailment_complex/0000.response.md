Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. While the function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII (or Unicode) value for valid single character inputs, it does not handle cases where the input, `char`, is not a single character string. For example, if the input is an empty string, a string of multiple characters, or any other type that is not a single character string, the function may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The lack of input validation means that the function does not conform to the requirement of reliably finding the ASCII value of a character as stated in the problem description. Thus, the program is incomplete in terms of its robustness and correctness regarding potential inputs.
