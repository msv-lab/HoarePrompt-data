The program description requires a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided code uses the `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point for a given character. This aligns with the task of obtaining the ASCII value of a character, provided the input is valid.

However, the program does not handle cases where the input is not a single character. If the input to the function is more than one character or an empty string, the behavior of the function is undefined according to the problem description. For example, calling `func_1('AB')` or `func_1('')` would not return a meaningful result as per the problem specifications.

The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where `char` is not a single character string, which confirms the potential issue with the implementation.

Given this analysis, the code fails to adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, particularly regarding invalid input of multiple characters or empty strings.

Correctness: **False**.
