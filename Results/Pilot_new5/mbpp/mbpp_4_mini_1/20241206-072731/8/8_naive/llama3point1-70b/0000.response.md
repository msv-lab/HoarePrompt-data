Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case when the character to be removed is not present in the string. The description states that we need to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, if the character is not present, the program currently returns the original string without any modification. According to the problem description, if a character is not found, there should be no removal, but the code does not explicitly handle edge cases where the character doesn't exist in the string correctly.

For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character to remove is 'x', the expected output should simply be "hello", which is correct according to the description. However, the program also returns "hello", making it seem correct on this input. 

However, consider the input "aabbcc" with the character 'b'. The program should return "aacc" after removing the first 'b' at index 2 and the last 'b' at index 3. 

Also, for the input string "abcba" with the character 'a', the expected output should be "bcb" after removing the first 'a' at index 0 and the last 'a' at index 4. The program handles these cases correctly.

But if you input an empty string with any character (e.g., '', 'a'), the output will be '', which is acceptable. 

Thus, the program does not cover the edge case and could lead to confusion when the character is not present, hence it is deemed incorrect.

In conclusion, since the initial requirement states the need to remove occurrences, the expectations should align with all cases, and the implementation does not ensure correctness across all expected scenarios.
