Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. The values indicate that `char` appears at least once in `s`, and `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`, meaning `char` appears more than once in `s`.***
