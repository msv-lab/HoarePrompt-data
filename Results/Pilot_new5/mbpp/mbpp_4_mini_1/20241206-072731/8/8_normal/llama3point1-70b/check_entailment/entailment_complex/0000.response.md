Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description, which explicitly states to "remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string." 

Here are the issues:

1. **Single Occurrence Case**: The program replaces the character only if it appears exactly once using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which is not what the problem description specifies. The problem description requires both the first and last occurrences to be removed, even if they are the same. 

2. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The logic for handling cases where the character occurs more than twice is flawed. The program attempts to remove both the first and last occurrences, but it relies on slicing and does not handle cases where the same character appears at both the first and last indices correctly. For example, for `s = "abcda"` and `char = "a"`, the expected result should be `"bcd"` (removing both 'a's), but the current implementation would not handle this correctly.

3. **Not Removing Both Occurrences**: The program does not provide a clear mechanism to remove both the specified occurrences correctly if there are multiple instances of the character beyond just first and last (i.e., if the character appears in the middle, those characters would remain).

Due to these reasons, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
