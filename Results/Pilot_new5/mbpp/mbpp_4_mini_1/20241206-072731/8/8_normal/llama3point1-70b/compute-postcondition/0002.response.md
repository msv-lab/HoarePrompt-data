Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. The current values are such that `first_occurrence` is not -1 and `last_occurrence` is not -1, indicating that `char` appears at least once in `s`.***
