The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. After executing the function body, if `ch` is not found in `s` (indicated by an index of -1) or if it occurs only once, the function returns the string `s` unchanged. However, if `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns a new string that is formed by removing the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` from the string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the string `s` based on the occurrences of the character `ch` and return either the unchanged string `s` or a modified version of `s` without the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `s` and a single character string parameter `ch`. If `ch` is not found in `s` or occurs only once, it returns `s`. If `ch` occurs more than once, it returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed from `s`.**
