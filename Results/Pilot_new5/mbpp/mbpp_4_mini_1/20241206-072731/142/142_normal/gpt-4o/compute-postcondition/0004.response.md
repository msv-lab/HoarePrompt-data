According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list, and `item` is equal to `element`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `item` must be updated to the second element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the list.**
