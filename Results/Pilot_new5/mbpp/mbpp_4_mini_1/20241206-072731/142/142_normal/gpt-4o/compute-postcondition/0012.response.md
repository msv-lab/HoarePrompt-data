The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `element`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be of any type, and `element` can also be of any type. After executing the function body, the function checks each element in the list against `element`. If for any element in the list the value is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the function iterates through all elements in the list without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an `element`, and return `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`, or `False` if any element is not equal to `element`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returning `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and returning `False` if any element in `lst` is not equal to `element`.**
