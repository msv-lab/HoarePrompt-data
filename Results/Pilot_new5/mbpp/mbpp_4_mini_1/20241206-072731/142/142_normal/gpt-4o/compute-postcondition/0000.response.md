According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `item` will hold the last element of the list. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and initially, `item` is the first element of the list. 

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list**
