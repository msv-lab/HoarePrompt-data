Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Using a Set**: The function converts the input list into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered for finding the second smallest.

2. **Sorting**: It then sorts the unique numbers. This allows for straightforward indexing to find the second smallest number.

3. **Indexing**: The function checks if there are more than one unique numbers. If there are, it returns the second smallest (the element at index 1), otherwise, it returns `None`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case checks a list with both negative and positive numbers, and it returns `-2`, the correct second smallest.
   - The second test case involves a mix of positive and negative numbers with duplicates, and it correctly returns `-0.5`.
   - The third and fourth test cases involve lists where all elements are the same. In both cases, the function returns `None`, indicating there is no second smallest number, which is the correct behavior.

The function handles various scenarios correctly, including when all numbers are the same and when there are less than two unique numbers. Since no edge cases fail, the program is deemed correct.
