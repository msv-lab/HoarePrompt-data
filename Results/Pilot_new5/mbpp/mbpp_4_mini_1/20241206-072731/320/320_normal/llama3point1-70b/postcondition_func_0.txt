The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, and it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. If there are fewer than two unique integers after removing duplicates, the function returns None. The code assumes there are at least two distinct elements initially, as stated in the precondition, but does not explicitly handle cases where `nums` might still result in fewer than two unique elements after conversion to a set.
