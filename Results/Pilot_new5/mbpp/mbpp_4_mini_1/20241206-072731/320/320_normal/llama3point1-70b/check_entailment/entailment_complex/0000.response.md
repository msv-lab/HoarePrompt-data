The program verifies if it can find the second smallest number in a list of integers, given that the list contains at least two distinct elements. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Assumptions**: The function `func_1` is designed to work with a list of integers (`nums`) that is stated to have at least two distinct elements. This assumption is crucial because the code relies on this condition to function correctly.

2. **Conversion to Unique Values**: The function converts the list `nums` to a set and then back to a list (`unique_nums`). This effectively removes duplicates, ensuring that only distinct integers are considered.

3. **Length Check**: After creating `unique_nums`, there's a check to see if its length is less than 2. If true, the function returns `None`. However, according to the precondition, `nums` is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct integers. Therefore, this condition should theoretically never be triggered given the input assumptions.

4. **Finding the Second Smallest**: The program sorts the `unique_nums` list and returns the second element, which corresponds to the second smallest unique integer.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description because:
- It correctly identifies the second smallest unique integer from a list of integers that contains at least two distinct elements.
- The precondition states that `nums` will have at least two distinct elements, ensuring the function behaves as intended.

Since the function adheres to the requirements and behaves correctly under the given assumptions, we can conclude that it fulfills the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
