Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the nth Lucas number according to the problem description. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The implementation accurately reflects this definition. It handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1 correctly, returning 2 and 1, respectively. For n > 1, it uses an iterative approach to compute the nth Lucas number, which efficiently calculates the result without recursion.

The assertions provided at the beginning confirm that the function returns the expected results for the inputs 9, 4, and 3, matching the known Lucas numbers:

- L(9) = 76
- L(4) = 7
- L(3) = 4

Since the program handles the required cases and correctly implements the definition of Lucas numbers for all non-negative integers, I conclude that the program is correct.
