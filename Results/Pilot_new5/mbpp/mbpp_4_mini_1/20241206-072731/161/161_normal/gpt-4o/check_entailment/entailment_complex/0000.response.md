The program is supposed to find the n-th Lucas number, as defined in the problem description. However, the implementation provided in the annotated program returns the Fibonacci number F(n + 1) for given non-negative integers.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Lucas Numbers**: The n-th Lucas number is defined as:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns 2 when `n == 0` and 1 when `n == 1`, which matches the Lucas number definition.
   - For `n > 1`, the loop computes values using `a` and `b`, initialized to 2 and 1 respectively, which are the two Lucas numbers. The loop, however, computes `b` as the Fibonacci number F(n + 1) and not the Lucas number L(n).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The function does not return the n-th Lucas number for any n > 1. Instead, it incorrectly computes the Fibonacci sequence. This is a crucial deviation from the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
