The statement `a, b = b, a + b` performs a simultaneous assignment, where `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`, we can only represent the relationship between them after the assignment.

Since `_` is given as 2, and `n` is greater than 1, we do not have specific values for `a` and `b` but we know the relationship:

1. `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
2. `b` becomes the previous value of `a + b`, which can be expressed as `new_b = old_a + old_b`.

The initial state of `n` being greater than 1 and `_` being 2 suggests that the program may be part of a Fibonacci-like sequence or some iterative process, but those values do not affect the assignment directly as they are not included in the assignment.

Therefore, after the execution:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a + b`.**
