The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously assigns the values to `a` and `b`. The previous values of the variables are:

- `a` is the previous value of `b`
- `b` is the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `a + b`

After executing the code:

1. The new value of `a` is assigned the old value of `b`.
2. The new value of `b` is assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and the old value of `b`.

Let's denote the previous value of `b` as `b_old`. Thus:
- The new value of `a` becomes `b_old`.
- The new value of `b` becomes `a + b_old`.

The state of the variables after the assignment will be:
- `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- `b` becomes `b_old + b_old` (since `a` was the previous value of `b`).

This means `b` now is `2 * b_old`.

Putting this all together, we have:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `_` is 4; `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is `2 * (previous value of b)`**.
