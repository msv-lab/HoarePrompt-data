The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and returns the Fibonacci number F(n + 1) for any positive integer `n` greater than 1. If `n` is negative, the behavior of the function is not defined as it only handles non-negative integers; however, since `n` is stated to be a non-negative integer, this edge case is implicitly handled.
