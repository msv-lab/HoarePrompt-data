Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number, but it incorrectly calculates the n-th Fibonacci number instead. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

However, in the program:
- The program correctly handles the base cases for L(0) and L(1).
- But in the loop, it calculates the Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers. The correct recurrence relation for Lucas numbers should utilize the previous two Lucas numbers, not Fibonacci numbers.

In the loop:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
Here `a` and `b` are initialized to 2 and 1, which represent the values of L(0) and L(1), respectively. However, the next values calculated are based on the Fibonacci relationship (`a + b`), which is incorrect for generating Lucas numbers. 

Thus, the program fails to implement the correct logic for calculating the n-th Lucas number. It would give incorrect results for n > 1 by returning Fibonacci numbers instead. 

Therefore, the correct assessment is that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
