The values of `a` and `b` are assigned as follows: `a` is set to 2 and `b` is set to 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this code. The other conditions regarding `n` still hold true after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
