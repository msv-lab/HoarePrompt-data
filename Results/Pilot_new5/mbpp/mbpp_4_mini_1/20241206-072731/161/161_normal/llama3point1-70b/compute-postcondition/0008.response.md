The value of `a` and `b` is updated using tuple unpacking. The old value of `b` (which is 1) is assigned to `a`, and the new value for `b` is calculated as `a + b` (which is `2 + 1` or `3`). Therefore, after executing the code, `a` becomes `1`, and `b` becomes `3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, loop variable starts at 2**
