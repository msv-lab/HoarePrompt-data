According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate starting from 2 up to and including `n`. Since we know that `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop:
- The loop variable starts from 2 (the lower limit) and will proceed up to `n + 1`.
- The condition ensures that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, the minimum value for `n` that satisfies these conditions is 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the current state can be expressed as:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, loop variable starts at 2**
