The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration, where `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. Given that the initial values of `a` and `b` are 2 and 1 respectively, we can determine the final values based on the iterations.

After executing the loop:

- If `n = 2`, the loop executes once, resulting in `a` being 1 and `b` being 3.
- If `n = 3`, the loop executes twice, leading to `a` being 3 and `b` being 4.
- If `n = 4`, the loop executes three times, resulting in `a` being 4 and `b` being 7.
- For `n >= 2`, upon completion of the loop, `a` and `b` will represent the (n-1)th and nth Fibonacci numbers respectively, considering the Fibonacci sequence starts from 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.**
