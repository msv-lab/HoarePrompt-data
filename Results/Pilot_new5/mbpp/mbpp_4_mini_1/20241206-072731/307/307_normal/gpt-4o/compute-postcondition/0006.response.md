The variable `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is 1, so after the increment, `k` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
