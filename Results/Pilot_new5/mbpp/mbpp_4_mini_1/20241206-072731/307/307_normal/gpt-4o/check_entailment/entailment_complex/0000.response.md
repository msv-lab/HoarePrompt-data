Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, the given assertions check for specific values of `k` for `n = 2`, `3`, and `4`, but they do not guarantee that the function will find the correct index of the triangular number that specifically has `n` digits. 

The issue arises because the function does not handle cases where there may be no triangular numbers with exactly `n` digits or when `n` is larger than the number of digits in the triangular numbers being computed. The function loops indefinitely, incrementing `k`, which means it may never terminate if no triangular number with `n` digits is found, leading to a situation where the function does not fulfill the problem's requirements. 

For instance, if we were to call `func_1(1)`, the function would return `1`, which is indeed the index of the first triangular number (1), but if we call with a larger `n`, there is no validation to ensure the function can provide an answer or terminate appropriately.

Overall, the assertions may pass for the values tested, but the function lacks a proper termination condition and checks, meaning it does not meet the problem description's requirements reliably across all potential cases.
