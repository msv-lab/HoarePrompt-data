Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `triangular_number` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, the function returns `k`, which is 2. Since the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`, the function does not return anything.***
