#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`, `triangular_number` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`. The function will continue to compute triangular numbers and increment `k` indefinitely until it finds a match, which means it does not have a termination condition for n being too large.
