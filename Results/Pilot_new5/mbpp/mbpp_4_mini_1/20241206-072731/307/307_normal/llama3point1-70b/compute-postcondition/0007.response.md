According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute one more time regardless of the current program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states, as the loop is designed to continue indefinitely.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 1; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
