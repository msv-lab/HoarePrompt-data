Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, and `triangular_num` is 3 with its string representation having a length less than `n`. If the length of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns the value of `idx`, which is 2. Otherwise, no value is returned.***
