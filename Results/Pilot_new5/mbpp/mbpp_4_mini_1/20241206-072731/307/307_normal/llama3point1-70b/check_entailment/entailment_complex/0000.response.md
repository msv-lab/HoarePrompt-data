Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle the case where `n` is non-positive (i.e., zero or negative). If `n` is non-positive, the while loop will continue indefinitely since no triangular number can have zero or negative digits, leading to an infinite loop. 

The problem description specifically states that the function should find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The implementation assumes that `n` is always a positive integer, but does not check or raise an error for invalid input values of `n`. This oversight means that the function could fail to terminate properly for such cases, which violates the requirement for correctness.
