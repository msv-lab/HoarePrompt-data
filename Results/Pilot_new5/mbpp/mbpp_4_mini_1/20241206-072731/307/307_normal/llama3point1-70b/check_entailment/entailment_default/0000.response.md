The provided Python program aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. A triangular number for index `idx` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The program continuously generates triangular numbers until it finds one with a number of digits equal to or greater than `n`.

Upon initial assessment of the problem description, the code appears to correctly implement the requirement for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. However, there is a lack of input validation: the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0. 

If `n` is non-positive, the loop could theoretically run indefinitely since the condition for returning an index (`len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`) would always evaluate to `True` for any positive triangular number (since any number has more than zero digits). Thus, if a user inputs a negative number or zero, the function would not terminate, leading to an infinite loop.

Now, examining the output hints: they indicate that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to `idx` has at least `n` digits. This aligns with the code's intent but reiterates the concern about non-positive `n` inputs.

Given this assessment, the code does not account for all potential cases specified in the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where `n` is non-positive, which could result in an infinite loop.
