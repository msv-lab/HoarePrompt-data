To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the problem statement and the code implementation.

The problem description states: "Write a python function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits." 

The implementation provided is as follows:
```python
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**:
   - The code calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) correctly.

2. **Finding the Smallest Triangular Number with n Digits**:
   - The program uses a while loop to continually compute triangular numbers until it finds one that has exactly `n` digits. 
   - The check `if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:` ensures that it is looking for triangular numbers with exactly `n` digits.

3. **Returning the Index**:
   - If it finds the first triangular number with `n` digits, it returns `k`, which is the index of that triangular number.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **n = 1**: The function does not have a check for when `n` is 1. The first triangular number (1) is the only one with 1 digit. The function would output `1`, which is correct.
- **n = 5**: The smallest triangular number with 5 digits is 10010, which corresponds to \( k = 140 \). The current implementation should return the correct index.
- **Negative Input**: If `n` is negative or zero, the function will run indefinitely as there is no condition to exit for such cases. This is a critical flaw.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 properly, leading to infinite loops or incorrect behavior. This demonstrates that the program is not robust against all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
