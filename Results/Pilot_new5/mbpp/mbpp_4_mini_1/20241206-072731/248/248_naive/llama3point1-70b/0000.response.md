Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function which is designed to take an iterable (such as a list) and convert it into a tuple. This function handles all typical cases, including empty lists and lists with various data types. Therefore, no potential cases exist where the program does not meet the problem description.
