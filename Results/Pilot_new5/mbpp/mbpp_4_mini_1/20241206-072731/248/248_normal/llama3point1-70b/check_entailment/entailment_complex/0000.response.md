Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `input_list`, which is expected to be a list of elements. It then uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert this list into a tuple, effectively fulfilling the requirement.

The annotations in the program clarify that the function handles any list input without restrictions on the type of elements. This means it will work for lists containing integers, strings, or any other object types, aligning with the general behavior of Python's `tuple()` function.

Since the function accurately processes any list and converts it to the corresponding tuple, it meets the criteria set out in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in its implementation.
