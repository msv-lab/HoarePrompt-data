To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem description**: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.

**Program**:
```python
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: the real part (`real`) and the imaginary part (`imag`) of a complex number.
2. It constructs a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. It then returns the phase (angle) of the complex number using `cmath.phase`, which is correct for computing the angle of a complex number in radians.

Now, let's check the assertions in the program:
- For `func_1(0, 1j)`, it correctly computes the angle of the complex number `0 + 1j`, which is π/2 or approximately 1.5708.
- For `func_1(2, 1j)`, it computes the angle of the complex number `2 + 1j`, which should be approximately 0.4636, and the assertion checks this value.
- For `func_1(0, 2j)`, it computes the angle of `0 + 2j`, which is again π/2 or approximately 1.5708.

**Potential Cases**:
- The function should work correctly for all complex numbers, including those with negative real and imaginary parts.
- An edge case to check would be when both the real and imaginary parts are zero (i.e., `func_1(0, 0)`). The angle of a zero complex number is undefined and could lead to issues.

**Testing Edge Case**:
```python
func_1(0, 0)  # This should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating undefined.
```

This case demonstrates that the program does not handle the case of a zero complex number correctly, as the phase of `(0, 0)` is not defined mathematically.

Therefore, since there exists at least one case where the program does not work correctly, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
