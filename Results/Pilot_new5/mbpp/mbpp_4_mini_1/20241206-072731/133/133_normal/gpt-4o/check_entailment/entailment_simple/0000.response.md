Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and computes the difference of corresponding elements by iterating through both tuples in parallel using the `zip` function.

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` pairs up the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` based on their indices, allowing for accurate element-wise subtraction.

2. **Return Type**: The result of the subtraction is returned as a tuple, which is exactly what the problem description calls for.

3. **Handling Equal Length**: The problem states that `tup1` and `tup2` are of equal length, which avoids any potential index errors during the iteration.

4. **General Case**: The function will work for any numerical values contained in the tuples, including negative numbers and zeroes, as it follows the same logic for all cases.

Given the assertions provided in the annotated program, each case correctly computes the difference between corresponding elements, confirming that the implementation aligns with the problem requirements.

Thus, the function is correct and meets the requirements as stated in the problem description.
