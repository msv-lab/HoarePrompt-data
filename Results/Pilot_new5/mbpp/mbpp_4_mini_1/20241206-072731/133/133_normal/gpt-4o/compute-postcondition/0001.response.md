The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of equal length containing numerical values. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the difference of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of equal length containing numerical values and return a tuple of the differences between corresponding elements of those tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple with the differences of corresponding elements from the two tuples.**
