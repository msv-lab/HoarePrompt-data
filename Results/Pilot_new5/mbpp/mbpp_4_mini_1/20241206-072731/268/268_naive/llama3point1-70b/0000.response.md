To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function and see if it fulfills the requirement of returning the maximum value in the specified column of a given matrix.

### Program Analysis:

The program provided is:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Problem Description:

The description states that the function should return the maximum value of the `n`-th column in the given matrix.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Indexing Error**: 
   - The program uses `row[n - 1]`, which implies that it assumes `n` is always a valid index. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix, this will raise an `IndexError`.
   - For example, if we pass `n = 0` or `n` larger than the number of columns in the rows, the program will fail.

2. **Empty Matrix**:
   - If an empty matrix is passed (`matrix = []`), the program will also raise a `ValueError` since `max()` cannot operate on an empty iterable.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**:
   - If the matrix has rows of inconsistent lengths (some rows have fewer columns than `n`), this will lead to an `IndexError` for those specific rows.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, we can identify that the program does not correctly handle scenarios where `n` is invalid or where the matrix is empty or has inconsistent row lengths.

Therefore, the output for the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for cases where `n` is out of bounds or when the matrix is empty.
