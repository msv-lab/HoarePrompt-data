Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, while it correctly identifies the maximum value from the `n`th column of a non-empty matrix where `n` is within bounds, it does not properly handle cases where the input matrix is empty or where `n` is out of bounds. In such situations, the behavior of the function is undefined, and it will raise an error when trying to access an index that does not exist or compute the maximum of an empty list.

For example:
1. If the function is called with an empty matrix `func_1([], 0)`, it will raise an `IndexError` because there are no rows and thus no elements to access.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)`), it will also raise an `IndexError`.

Since the function does not account for these potential errors and thus does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description, it cannot be considered correct.
