Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Input Structure**: The function takes two inputs: `matrix`, which is a list of lists (representing a matrix), and `n`, which is a non-negative integer indicating the column index from which to find the maximum value.

2. **Column Extraction**: The line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly constructs a new list that contains all the elements from the `n`-th column of the `matrix`. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each row in the matrix and retrieves the element at index `n`.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: The function then uses the built-in `max()` function to determine the maximum value from the extracted `nth_column`. 

4. **Edge Cases**: The problem description implicitly assumes that `n` is always within the bounds of the matrix (i.e., `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`), which is also confirmed by the assert test cases. Hence, there are no cases of out-of-bounds errors due to invalid column indices.

5. **Returned Value**: The function returns the maximum value from the specified column, fulfilling the requirement stated in the problem description.

In summary, the function correctly implements the specified behavior of returning the maximum value from the `n`-th column of a matrix, and it adheres to the constraints set forth in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
