The code creates a new list `nth_column` that contains the elements from the nth column of the `matrix`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer within the bounds of the number of columns in the matrix. The existing states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists of numbers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), `nth_column` is a list containing the n-th column of `matrix`.**
