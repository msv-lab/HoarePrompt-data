Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists of numbers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the n-th column of `matrix`. It assumes that `n` is within the bounds of the number of columns in the matrix. If `matrix` is empty or `n` is out of bounds, the behavior is undefined as the maximum function will raise an error. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `matrix` is non-empty and that `n` is valid before calling this function. **
