#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in ascending order, derived from the original list_of_lists containing strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each sublist is expected to contain strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the strings sorted in ascending order. If any sublist is empty, it will remain empty in the output. Additionally, if `list_of_lists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.
