The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each sublist is expected to contain strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the strings sorted in ascending order. If any sublist is empty, it will remain empty in the output. Additionally, if `list_of_lists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.
