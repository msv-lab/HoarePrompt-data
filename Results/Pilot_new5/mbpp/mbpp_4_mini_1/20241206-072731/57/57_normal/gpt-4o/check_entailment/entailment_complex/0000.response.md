Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. The issue lies in the way the expected output is specified in the assertions. 

1. The expected output in the assert statements for the first test case is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is incorrect because the third sublist `['white', 'black', 'orange']` should be sorted as `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, not `['black', 'orange', 'white']` as indicated. 

2. The second test case's expected output is also incorrect. The sublist `[' blue ', ' black']` should be sorted to `[' black', ' blue ']`, but it is expected to return `[' black', 'blue ']` in the assertion, which implies incorrect sorting.

3. The output of the last test case is correctly given, but the incorrect assertions in the first two cases indicate that the program does not consistently adhere to the sorting logic as required.

Thus, the assertions themselves do not represent the correct expected behavior of the function, leading to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the problem description requirements correctly.
