The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, it returns a list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner using the strings from the original `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists containing strings and return a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists of strings, and returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.**
