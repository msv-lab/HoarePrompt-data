The function accepts non-negative float or integer parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the volume of a triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length. There are no checks for negative values or handling of unexpected inputs, but the mathematical calculation will succeed as long as the inputs are non-negative.
