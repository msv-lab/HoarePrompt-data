Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the volume of a prism, which is the area of the base (in this case, a triangle) multiplied by the height (length) of the prism. 

Here's how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Inputs**: The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, all of which are non-negative floats or integers. This matches the requirement to accept dimensions relevant to the triangular prism.

2. **Calculation**: The base area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, which is the correct formula for the area of a triangle. Subsequently, the volume is calculated as `base_area * length`, which correctly computes the volume of the prism.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed volume, which is exactly what the problem statement requires.

4. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function produces the expected results for various test cases, affirming its correctness.

Overall, the function accurately follows the problem description and calculates the volume of a triangular prism as intended.
