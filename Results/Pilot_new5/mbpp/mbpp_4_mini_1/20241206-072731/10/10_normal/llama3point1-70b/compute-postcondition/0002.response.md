Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. There are no checks for negative or zero values for `b`, `h`, or `l`, which could lead to incorrect or undefined volume calculations.**
