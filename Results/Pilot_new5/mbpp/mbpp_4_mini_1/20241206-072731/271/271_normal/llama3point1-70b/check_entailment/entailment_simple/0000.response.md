Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples as input and calculates the average of the corresponding values from each inner tuple.

Here's how the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The program assumes that the input `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculating Averages**: The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to unpack the inner tuples and create groups of corresponding elements across all tuples. For example, if the input is `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, `zip` will generate the groups `(1, 3, 5)` and `(2, 4, 6)`, which represent the first and second positions.

3. **Sum and Length**: For each group of corresponding elements, the program calculates the sum of the values and divides by the number of inner tuples (using `len(tuples)`) to compute the average. This is exactly what the problem description asks for: to compute the average for each position based on the values from all tuples.

4. **Output Structure**: The result is returned as a list of averages, which matches the requirement to return a list.

Thus, the function implements the required logic correctly for any valid input as per the problem description.
