The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. After executing the function body, it returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples in `tuples`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and return a list of averages computed from the corresponding elements of the inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, and returns a list of averages calculated from the corresponding elements of the inner tuples.**
