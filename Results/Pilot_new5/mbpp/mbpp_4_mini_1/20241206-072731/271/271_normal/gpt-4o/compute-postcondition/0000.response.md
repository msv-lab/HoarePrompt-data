`num_elements` is assigned the value of the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values, and `num_elements` is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values; `num_elements` is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`.**
