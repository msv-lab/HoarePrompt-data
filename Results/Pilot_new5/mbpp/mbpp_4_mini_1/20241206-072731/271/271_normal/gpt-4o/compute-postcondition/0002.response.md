According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. The loop will execute if `num_elements` is at least 1, as the range function requires a positive integer to iterate. The `tuples` variable must contain at least one tuple for `num_elements` to be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last index reached in the loop (which is `num_elements - 1`). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `tuples` must contain at least one tuple, and `num_elements` must be greater than 0. Initially, `i` must start at 0.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
