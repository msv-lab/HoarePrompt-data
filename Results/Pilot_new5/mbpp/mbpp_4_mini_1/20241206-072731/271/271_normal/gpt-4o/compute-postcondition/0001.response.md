The variable `averages` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `tuples` and `num_elements` are not affected by this operation. The length of the first inner tuple within `tuples` still defines `num_elements`, and `tuples` remains as a tuple of tuples with numeric values. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`, `averages` is an empty list.**
