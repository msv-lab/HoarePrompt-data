Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and calculates the average for each position across all inner tuples. It returns a list of these averages. If the inner tuples are empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the inner tuples have varying lengths, which could lead to an IndexError. Therefore, it is assumed that all inner tuples are of the same length. **
