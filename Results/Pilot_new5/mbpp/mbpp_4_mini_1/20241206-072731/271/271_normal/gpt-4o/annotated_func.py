#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` is the length of the first tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the averages of each position across all tuples in `tuples`. If `num_elements` is 0, then `averages` remains an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns the list of averages for each position across all tuples in 'tuples', which is determined by the numeric values contained in 'tuples'. If 'num_elements' is 0, then 'averages' is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and calculates the average for each position across all inner tuples. It returns a list of these averages. If the inner tuples are empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the inner tuples have varying lengths, which could lead to an IndexError. Therefore, it is assumed that all inner tuples are of the same length.
