The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a list containing the `i`-th element from each tuple in the `tuples`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 0, it confirms that there is at least one tuple in `tuples`, and `i` is initially 0, so the first element from each tuple will be extracted. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
