The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The value of `sum(elements_at_position)` is the sum of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `len(tuples)` returns the number of tuples present. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
