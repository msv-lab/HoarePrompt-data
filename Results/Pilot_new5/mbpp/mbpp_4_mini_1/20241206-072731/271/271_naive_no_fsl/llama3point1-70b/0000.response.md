To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. Specifically, for each index position across the tuples, it computes the average of the values found at that index.

### Provided Implementation:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analysis of the Implementation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single argument, `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples.
2. **Averaging Logic**: It uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the tuples, which means it groups all the first elements of the tuples together, all the second elements together, and so on. For each group of values, it calculates the sum and divides by the number of tuples to get the average.
3. **Return Type**: The function returns a list of averages, which is consistent with what the problem states.

### Edge Cases:
We need to consider potential edge cases such as:
1. **Empty Input**: If `tuples` is an empty tuple of tuples, `func_1(())` would lead to a division by zero error since `len(tuples)` would be zero.
2. **Single Tuple**: If `tuples` contains only one tuple (e.g., `((1, 2, 3),)`), it should correctly return a list of that single tupleâ€™s values as averages (e.g., `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`).
3. **Tuples of Different Lengths**: If the inner tuples are of different lengths, `zip(*tuples)` will only process up to the length of the shortest tuple, potentially ignoring valid data.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not handle the edge case of empty input and would throw a division error. Thus, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**

### Additional Note:
If we were to run `func_1(())`, it would lead to a ZeroDivisionError. Hence, the function does not correctly implement the requirements given the problem description for all possible inputs.
