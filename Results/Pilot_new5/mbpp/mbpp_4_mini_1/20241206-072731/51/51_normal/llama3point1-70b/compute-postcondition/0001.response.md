According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since it has at least one element, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. The loop will iterate over the elements in `numbers`, and during the first iteration, `num` will be assigned the first element of the list. Since `product` is initialized to 1 and is not affected by the loop's execution condition, no adjustments are needed for it.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 1 element, `product` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list `numbers`**
