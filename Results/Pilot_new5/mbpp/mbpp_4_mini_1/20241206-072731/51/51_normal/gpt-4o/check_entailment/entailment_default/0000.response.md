The provided program aims to multiply all numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list. 

Analyzing the code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

1. **Correctness of the Code**:
   - The code correctly calculates the product of all numbers in the list.
   - It then divides this product by the length of the list and returns the result.
   - However, it does not check for any non-numeric types in the input list, which could lead to a `TypeError` during multiplication if a non-numeric value is present in the list.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list contains a `0`, the product will indeed be `0`, and the final result will also be `0`, which is handled correctly.
   - If the list contains any non-numeric types (e.g., strings, None), the function will raise a `TypeError`, which is not handled in the program.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The hints confirm that the function is expected to handle numeric inputs and that it returns the product divided by the length of the list. They also point out that a zero in the list will result in a zero output.
   - The hints highlight that non-numeric types are not handled, which aligns with the potential problems in the code. 

Given that the program does not handle cases where non-numeric types might be present in the input list, this is a critical oversight. 

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program does not account for non-numeric types in the input list, which can lead to a `TypeError`. Thus, it fails to meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
