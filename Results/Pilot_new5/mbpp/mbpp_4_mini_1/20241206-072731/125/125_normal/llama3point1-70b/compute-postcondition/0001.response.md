The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, it returns a list of sublists from `lst`. Each sublist is created by taking elements from `lst` starting at index `i` and continuing in steps of `n`, for each `i` in the range from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of sublists where each sublist consists of elements from `lst` taken at intervals of `n`, starting from different indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements from `lst` starting at each index from 0 to n-1 and continuing in steps of `n`.**
