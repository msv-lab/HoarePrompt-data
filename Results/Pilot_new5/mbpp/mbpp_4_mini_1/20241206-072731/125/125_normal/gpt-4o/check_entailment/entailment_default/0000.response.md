Let's analyze the provided problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

**Problem Description:** The function should take a list and an integer `n`, then split the list for every `nth` element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The function initializes a list `result` with `n` empty sublists.
2. It iterates through the input list `lst` and places each element into one of the `n` sublists, based on the index of the element (`i % n`).
3. The function then returns the `result`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than or equal to zero, the function does not handle this situation and would raise an error when trying to create `result` with a negative or zero size.
- If the input list `lst` is empty, the output will be a list of `n` empty sublists, which may not be the expected behavior since there are no elements to distribute.
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, it correctly creates sublists, but we might have an expectation that it should return non-empty sublists.

**Output Hints:**
The hints confirm that the function distributes elements in a round-robin manner. They also mention that:
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the result will contain empty sublists for the remaining indices.
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero, nor does it validate whether `lst` is empty.

**Conclusion:**
The code does not handle the edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero and does not appropriately handle an empty list. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to address cases where `n` is zero or negative, which is a significant oversight given the problem description. For example, calling `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 0)` would result in an error instead of a meaningful result.
