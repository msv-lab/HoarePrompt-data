Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, the function is supposed to "split a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists." However, the implementation does not adhere to this requirement in the following way:

1. The function utilizes a round-robin approach to distribute the elements of the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, rather than splitting the list into chunks of size `n`. This means that the resulting lists are not contiguous sublists of size `n`, but rather contain elements that are distributed across the entire list.

2. For example, given the input `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n = 3`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i'], ['j', 'k', 'l'], ['m', 'n']]`, which is not what the current implementation produces.

3. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero, or where `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than `n`. If `n` were greater than the length of the list, the result would have empty sublists, which also does not align with the requirement of returning sublists based on splitting.

In summary, the function's method of grouping elements does not match the problem's requirement for splitting the list into chunks of size `n`, leading to an incorrect implementation.
