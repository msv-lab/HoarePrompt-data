To verify the program's state after the execution of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop over all iterations.

Initial State: `lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`, `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.

The loop distributes the elements of `lst` into `result` based on their indices, using the modulo operator to determine which sublist in `result` the current element should be appended to.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- Each element from `lst` will be appended to one of the `n` sublists in `result`.
- The index `i` will run from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`, which means it will execute a total of `len(lst)` times.

For every element at index `i` in `lst`, it will be appended to `result[i % n]`. This means:
- Every sublist in `result` will receive elements from `lst` in a round-robin fashion.
- The total number of elements in `result` will still be the same as the number of elements in `lst`.

If `len(lst)` is `m`, after all iterations:
- Each sublist `result[j]` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) will contain approximately `m // n` elements, with some sublists possibly containing one additional element if `m` is not divisible by `n`.

Output State: **`result` contains all elements from `lst` distributed across `n` sublists in a round-robin manner, with `len(result[j])` approximately equal to `len(lst) // n` for each `j`, and `lst` must have at least `n` elements.**
