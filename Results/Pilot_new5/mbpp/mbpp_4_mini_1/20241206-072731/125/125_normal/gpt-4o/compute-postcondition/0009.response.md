The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The function returns a list called `result`, which contains all elements from `lst` distributed across `n` sublists in a round-robin manner. Each sublist has a length approximately equal to `len(lst) // n`, and it is guaranteed that `lst` has at least `n` elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists created by distributing the elements of `lst` in a round-robin fashion. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n, and returns a list of n sublists created by distributing the elements of lst in a round-robin manner.**
