Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements from two lists. It converts both input lists to sets, computes their intersection using the `&` operator, and then returns a tuple of the sorted common elements. 

The assertions provided as test cases confirm that it returns the expected results for the given inputs:

1. For inputs `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, the common elements are `(4, 5)`.
2. For inputs `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)`, the common elements are `(3, 4)`.
3. For inputs `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)`, the common elements are `(13, 14)`.

Since all potential cases handled by this function produce the correct and expected output, the program is correct.
