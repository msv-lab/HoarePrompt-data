Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two input lists. It uses set operations to find the intersection of the two lists, which effectively gives the desired result. Since it handles all cases, including when one or both lists are empty, it adheres to the problem description accurately. For example, if one list is empty, the result will be an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
