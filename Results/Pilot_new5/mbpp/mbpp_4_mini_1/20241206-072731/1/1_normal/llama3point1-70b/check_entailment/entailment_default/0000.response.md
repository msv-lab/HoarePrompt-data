To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down both the description and the code:

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

### Initial Assessment

The code is using sets to find the intersection of the two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. This means that it should successfully identify the unique common elements between the two lists and return them as a tuple. The approach seems valid for finding shared elements.

### Edge Cases

1. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which aligns with the expectation of returning an empty tuple when there are no shared elements.
2. If one list is empty and the other has elements, it will also correctly return an empty tuple.
3. If both lists contain the same elements, it will return a tuple of those elements.
4. If there are duplicate elements within the lists (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 3, 4]`), it will also correctly return only the shared unique elements.

### Output Hints Verification

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the unique elements from the two lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.

The output hints align with the program's functionality as described. The hints correctly state that the function returns the intersection of unique elements and handles the case of returning an empty tuple when there are no shared elements.

### Conclusion

After analyzing both the problem description and the output hints, along with considering potential edge cases, it appears that the code does correctly implement the desired functionality. All cases mentioned seem to be handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function accurately identifies shared elements between the two lists and adheres to the problem description.
