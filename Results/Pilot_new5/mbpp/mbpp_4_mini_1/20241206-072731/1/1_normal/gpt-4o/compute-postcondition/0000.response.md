`common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection of `list1` and `list2`, which means it will contain only the elements that are present in both lists. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any data types, and `common_elements` is a set of elements common to both `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any data types; `common_elements` is a set of elements common to both `list1` and `list2`.**
