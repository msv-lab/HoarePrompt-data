Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because the function `func_1(a, b)` takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, which are numbers (either integers or floats), and it returns a tuple containing the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This directly aligns with the problem description that specifies the output should be a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. 

In Python, the return statement `return b, a` creates a tuple `(b, a)` implicitly, which is exactly what the problem requires. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the stated requirements, as it consistently places the second input first in the output tuple. Thus, the program satisfies the problem description fully.
