The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it returns the values of `b` and `a` in that order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two numbers, `a` and `b`, and return them in the order of `b` followed by `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the values of `b` and `a` in that order.**
