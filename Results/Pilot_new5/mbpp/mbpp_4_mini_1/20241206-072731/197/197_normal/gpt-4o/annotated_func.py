#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elements is a list of elements that may be present in tup.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total occurrences of elements from the list 'elements' in the tuple 'tup', represented by the non-negative integer 'count'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total count of how many times each element from `elements` appears in `tup`, represented as a non-negative integer. It correctly counts occurrences even if `elements` is empty or if none of the elements are found in `tup`, returning 0 in those cases.
