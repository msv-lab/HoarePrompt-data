You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns whether the integer 'month' between 1 and 12 is one of the months (April, June, September, November) that have 30 days, which are represented in 'months_with_30_days' as {4, 6, 9, 11}.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` between 1 and 12 and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional checks for invalid inputs, so if the input is outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will still return either `True` or `False` based solely on the membership of `month` in the defined set.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
