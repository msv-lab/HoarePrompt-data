Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `month` between 1 and 12 and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional checks for invalid inputs, so if the input is outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will still return either `True` or `False` based solely on the membership of `month` in the defined set. **
