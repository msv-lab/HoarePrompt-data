#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if 'month' is one of the months with thirty days (4, 6, 9, 11); otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11), which are the months with thirty days. For all other months, including those with thirty-one or twenty-eight days, it returns `False`. The function does not handle invalid inputs (months outside the range of 1 to 12).
