Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters and ignores lowercase characters entirely. This means that the output will not be the intended result of removing lowercase substrings; rather, it constructs a new string that only contains uppercase characters. For example, if the input is "HelloWorld", the output would be "HW", which does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings. The expected behavior would be to return a string with only non-lowercase substrings included, which the current implementation does not achieve.
