The variable `result` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is the third character of the non-empty string `s`. Since `s` has at least 3 characters, `char` will have a valid value. The initial value of `result` can either be an empty string or may contain uppercase characters, but it will definitely contain the `char` after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `result` now contains the previous value of `result` concatenated with `char`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `result` is the previous value of `result` concatenated with `char`.**
