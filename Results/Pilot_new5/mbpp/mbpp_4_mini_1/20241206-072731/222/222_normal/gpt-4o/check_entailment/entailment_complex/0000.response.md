The annotated program's purpose is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, as stated in the problem description. However, the implementation of the `func_1` function does not meet this requirement.

The function `func_1(s)` returns a string that contains only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`, filtering out all lowercase and non-uppercase characters. This means that while it effectively removes lowercase characters, it does not specifically focus on "removing lowercase substrings." A lowercase substring can be defined as a contiguous sequence of lowercase letters, and the function does not consider the context of substrings â€” it treats individual characters independently.

For example, consider the string `'abcDEFghi'`. The expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return `'DEF'`, which removes the lowercase substrings `'abc'` and `'ghi'`. However, the current function would return `'DEF'`, which seems correct in this example, but it fails to address cases where lowercase characters are part of the same segment with other characters.

Furthermore, the assert statements provided only test for cases where the output appears to be correct, but they do not validate the complete behavior of the function with all possible strings. 

Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings" as a defined segment, as it merely filters based on character case.

Correctness: **False**
