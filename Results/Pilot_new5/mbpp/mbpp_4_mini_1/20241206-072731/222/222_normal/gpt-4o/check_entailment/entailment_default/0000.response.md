The function `func_1` aims to remove all lowercase substrings from a given string based on the problem description. The implementation uses a list comprehension to filter out characters that are not uppercase, returning only uppercase characters as a new string. 

An initial assessment reveals that the function appears to correctly fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase characters from the string. It effectively constructs a new string comprised solely of uppercase characters by iterating over the characters in the input string and checking whether each character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method.

However, we must consider potential edge cases. For example, if the input string consists entirely of lowercase characters or if it is an empty string, the function should return an empty string, which it does, as there would be no uppercase characters to include.

Next, we analyze the output hints, which state: "The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`, filtering out all lowercase and non-uppercase characters." This accurately describes the behavior of the function as it aligns with the code implementation.

Considering all points, the code adheres to the problem description for all cases, and there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to operate correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
