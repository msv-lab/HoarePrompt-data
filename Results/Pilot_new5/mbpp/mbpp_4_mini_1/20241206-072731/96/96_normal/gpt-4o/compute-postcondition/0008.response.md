According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`. At the end of the last iteration, `element` holds the first element of `tup`, and since `tup` is a non-empty tuple, it has at least one element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to understand that `element` should be the next element in the tuple after the last one processed. If the `tup` has `n` elements, the loop would be executed `n` times, starting with the first element and ending with the last. Since we know that `element` is currently the first element, we need to set `element` to the second element in the tuple, and for the loop to be able to execute again, `tup` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple that must have at least 2 elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the second element of `tup`**
