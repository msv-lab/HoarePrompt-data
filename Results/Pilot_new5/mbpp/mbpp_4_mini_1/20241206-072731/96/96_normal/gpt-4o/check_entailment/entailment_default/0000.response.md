The given function `func_1` is designed to check whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements share the same type as the first element; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Let's analyze the code based on the provided problem description:

1. **Empty Tuple**: The function correctly handles the case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, as specified in the problem description. This is correctly implemented in the line `if not tup: return True`.

2. **Same Data Type Check**: The function assigns the type of the first element to `first_type`. It then iterates through each element of the tuple and compares its type to `first_type`. If any element's type does not match, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`.

3. **Non-Empty Tuples with Mixed Types**: The function seems to handle tuples with mixed types correctly. For example, for the input `(1, 2, '4')`, it would return `False` as expected because the types are `int` and `str`.

Now, evaluating the output hints:
- The hints state that the function returns `True` for an empty tuple and for tuples where all elements are of the same type. It also states that it returns `False` when the tuple contains elements of different types. This is consistent with the function's behavior.

4. **Edge Cases**: I will consider some additional edge cases:
   - A tuple with a single element, e.g., `(1,)`, should return `True` since there is only one element.
   - A tuple with multiple identical types, like `(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, should return `True` as all elements are of type `float`.
   - A tuple with mixed types, such as `(1.0, '2')`, should return `False`.

After reviewing the code against the problem description and output hints, I find that:
- The function behaves as described in all tested cases.
- It does not miss any cases regarding type checks.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type and handles edge cases as expected.
