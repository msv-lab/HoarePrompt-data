Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by creating a set of the types of each element in the tuple and then checking if the length of that set is `1`. If all elements are of the same type, the set will have only one unique type, leading to a length of `1`. If there are different types present, the length will be greater than `1`.

Here are a few example cases that confirm its correctness:

1. `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
2. `func_1((1, 2.0, 3))` returns `False` because there are both integers and floats.
3. `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'))` returns `True` because all elements are strings.
4. `func_1((None, None))` returns `True` since both elements are of type `NoneType`.

Since I couldn't find any input that causes the function to return an incorrect result, I conclude that the implementation is correct for all potential cases.
