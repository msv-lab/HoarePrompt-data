Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there are duplicate numbers in the list correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` if the list does not contain strictly consecutive numbers. However, the current implementation allows for duplicates, which means it will return `True` for lists like `[1, 2, 2, 3]` or `[1, 1, 2]`, even though these lists do not contain strictly consecutive numbers.

For example:
- For the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would return `True`, but according to the problem description, it should return `False` because of the duplicate `2`.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
