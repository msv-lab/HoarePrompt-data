Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Below is an explanation of how the program meets the requirements.

1. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function first checks if the list `lst` is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`, as an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers. This behavior is consistent with the requirement to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program then sorts the input list. Sorting is essential because it allows the program to easily check for consecutive numbers by comparing adjacent elements.

3. **Checking for Consecutiveness**: The function uses a loop to iterate through the sorted list. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the difference between them is exactly 1. If it finds any pair that does not satisfy this condition, it returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain only consecutive numbers.

4. **Returning True for Valid Cases**: If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`, which indicates that all elements in the list are indeed consecutive.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases for the function:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`, which is correct because the numbers are consecutive.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False`, which is correct because there is a gap between 3 and 5.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False`, which is correct because the number 1 is repeated and thus does not form a sequence of consecutive integers.

In summary, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement for all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
