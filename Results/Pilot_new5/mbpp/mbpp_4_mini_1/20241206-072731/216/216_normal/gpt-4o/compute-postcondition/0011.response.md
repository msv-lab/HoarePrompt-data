According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the length of `lst_sorted` must be at least 4 (since `i` can only go up to `len(lst_sorted) - 2` for the loop to execute).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 4 elements, and `i` is 2**
