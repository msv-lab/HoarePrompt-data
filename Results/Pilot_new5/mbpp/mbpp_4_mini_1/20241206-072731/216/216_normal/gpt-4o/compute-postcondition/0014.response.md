Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, and if the loop completes without returning False, then all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` differ by 1. If `lst_sorted` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` remains unchanged.**
