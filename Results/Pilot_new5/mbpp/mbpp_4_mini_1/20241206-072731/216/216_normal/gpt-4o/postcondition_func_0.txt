The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if the list is empty or if any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `lst` do not differ by 1. If all consecutive elements differ by 1, it returns `True`. However, if `lst` has fewer than 2 elements (which makes the check for consecutive differences irrelevant), the function will return `True` as well, because there are no pairs to compare.
