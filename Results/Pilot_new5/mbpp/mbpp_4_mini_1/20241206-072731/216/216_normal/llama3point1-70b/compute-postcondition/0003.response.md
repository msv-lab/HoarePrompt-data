Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if `lst` is a sorted list of consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`. It checks for consecutive integers by ensuring that the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1, and it verifies that there are no duplicate values by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list. Note that if `lst` is empty or contains only one element, the function will return `False` since there would be no consecutive integers. **
