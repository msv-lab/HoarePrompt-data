The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with a length of N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from the original tuple `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` of numbers and return a tuple with the products of adjacent elements from `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with length N+1 and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from `t`.**
