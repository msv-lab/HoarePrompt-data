Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and counts the number of elements in that list that are integers. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Counting Integers**: The expression `isinstance(x, int)` checks if each element `x` in the list is an integer. This is done for every element in the list using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function.

2. **Returning the Count**: The `sum()` function effectively counts the number of `True` values generated by the generator expression (where `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`). Therefore, the final output is the count of integer elements in the list.

3. **Empty or Non-Integer Lists**: If the list is empty or contains no integers, the generator expression will yield no `True` values, resulting in a return value of `0`. This behavior aligns with the expected behavior of counting integers, and it properly handles edge cases.

As a result, the program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description by accurately counting and returning the number of integer elements in the provided list.
