#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, which may include integers and non-integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` that may contain various types of elements and returns the count of elements in the list that are integers. It does not handle cases where the list is empty or when all elements are non-integer types, but it will simply return 0 in such cases, which is consistent with the expected behavior of counting integer elements.
