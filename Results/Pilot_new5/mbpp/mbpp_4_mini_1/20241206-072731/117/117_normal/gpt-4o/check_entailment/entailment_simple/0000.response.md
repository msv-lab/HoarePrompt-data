Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to count the number of integer elements in the list `lst`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the criteria of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a list `lst` as input, which is consistent with the requirement to analyze a list of elements.

2. **Counting Integers**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate through each element `x` in the list and checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. This ensures that only integer elements are counted.

3. **Correct Return Value**: The output of the function is the total count of integers, which matches the expectation set forth in the problem description (to return the number of integer elements in the list).

4. **Test Cases**: The included assertions serve as test cases to verify the correctness of the function:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, the result is correctly calculated as `2` (the integers are `1` and `2`).
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the result is `3`, as all elements are integers.
   - For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, the result is `2` (the integers are `1` and `4`).

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including lists with mixed types and lists with only integers.

In summary, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description by accurately counting integer elements in a list, thus confirming its correctness.
