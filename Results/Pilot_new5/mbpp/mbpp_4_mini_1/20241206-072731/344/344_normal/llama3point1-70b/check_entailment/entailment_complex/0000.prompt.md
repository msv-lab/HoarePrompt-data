You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer that may or may not be present in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and if `value` is not found in `sorted_list`, it is greater than the last element of `sorted_list`. If `value` is found, `i` would be the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If the list is empty, then `i` is 0.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list', which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function does not handle the case where the first element is less than the value, as there are no checks for returning 1 or 2 based on the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
