Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which accurately finds the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Here's why the implementation meets the requirements:

1. **Sorted List Handling**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Insertion Point**: It returns the index where the `value` can be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain the order. The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures that if `value` is equal to an existing element, it will be inserted to the right of the last occurrence of that element, thus maintaining the sorted order.

3. **Boundary Cases**:
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, `bisect.bisect_right` will return the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point at the end.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the first element, it will return 0, indicating the correct insertion point at the start.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code test various scenarios and confirm that the function behaves correctly according to the expected output.

Since the function correctly determines the right insertion point for any integer value in a sorted list, it adheres to the problem description's requirements in all potential cases. Thus, the program is correct.
