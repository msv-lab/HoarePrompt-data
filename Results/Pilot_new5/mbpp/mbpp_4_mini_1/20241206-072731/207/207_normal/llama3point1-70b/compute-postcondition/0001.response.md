The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated by multiplying `length` by `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integer parameters, `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle formed by these dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, both positive integers, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
