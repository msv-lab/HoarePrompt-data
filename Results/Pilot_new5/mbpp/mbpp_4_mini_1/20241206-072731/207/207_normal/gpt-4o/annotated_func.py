#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are positive real numbers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as length multiplied by width, where both length and width are positive real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive real numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as `length` multiplied by `width`. It assumes that both inputs are positive real numbers and does not handle cases where the inputs may be zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of area.
