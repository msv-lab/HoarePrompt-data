Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to calculate the area of a rectangle using the formula `length * width`. The assertions provided test the function with various pairs of length and width, and in each case, the function returns the expected area:

1. For `func_1(10, 20)`, it calculates `10 * 20`, which equals `200`.
2. For `func_1(10, 5)`, it calculates `10 * 5`, which equals `50`.
3. For `func_1(4, 2)`, it calculates `4 * 2`, which equals `8`.

The function handles positive integer inputs correctly, which are common for length and width measurements.

However, the program does not handle potential edge cases such as:
- Negative values for length or width, which would not make sense in this context.
- Zero values for length or width, which would also result in an area of zero, but technically still indicates the presence of a rectangle of zero area.

Despite these considerations, the function works properly and returns expected results for the tested cases. Since I could not find any instance where the function does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct for the given specifications.
