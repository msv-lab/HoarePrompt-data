Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 4, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 3, and the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to either `first_digit` or `second_digit`. If `i % 2 == 0` and `s[i]` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. If `i % 2` is not equal to 0 or `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`, there is no return value (None).***
