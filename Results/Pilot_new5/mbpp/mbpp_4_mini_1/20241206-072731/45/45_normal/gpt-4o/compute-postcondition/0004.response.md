The variable `first_digit` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`, which is the first digit of the integer `n`. Since `s` is a string representation of `n` and the length of `s` is 3 or more, the first digit will be the first character of that string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is 3 or more, `first_digit` is the first character of `s` (the first digit of `n`).**
