According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. The loop starts at `i = 2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 4 at the start of the next iteration.

Additionally, since `s` is a string of length at least 4, `len(s)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to be able to execute again with `i` equal to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 5, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4**
