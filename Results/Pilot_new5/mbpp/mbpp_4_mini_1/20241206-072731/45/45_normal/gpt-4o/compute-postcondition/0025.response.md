Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 5, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is an odd integer and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
