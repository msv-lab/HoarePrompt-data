The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer. The function evaluates various conditions and returns specific boolean values based on those evaluations. 

- If the value of `n` is represented as a string `s` with a length of less than 3, it returns `False`.
- If certain conditions are not met, it returns `False`.
- In multiple cases, it returns `False`, indicating that specific conditions are not satisfied.
- If the integer `i` is 3 (which is not even), the function returns `False` as well, without any restrictions on the return value in this case.
- Finally, if all conditions regarding the string `s` are satisfied, where all even indexed characters are equal to `first_digit` and all odd indexed characters are equal to `second_digit`, it returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and evaluate various conditions related to a string representation of `n`, returning `True` if specific conditions about the characters in the string are satisfied or `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, evaluates conditions related to its string representation, and returns True if specific conditions about the characters in the string are satisfied; otherwise, it returns False.**
