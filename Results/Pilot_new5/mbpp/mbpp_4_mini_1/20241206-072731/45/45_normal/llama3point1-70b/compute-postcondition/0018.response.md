Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100" and has a length of at least 4. If the digit at position `i` (which is 3) is either part of an increasing or decreasing sequence with its neighbors, the function proceeds as normal. Otherwise, the variable `undulating` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
