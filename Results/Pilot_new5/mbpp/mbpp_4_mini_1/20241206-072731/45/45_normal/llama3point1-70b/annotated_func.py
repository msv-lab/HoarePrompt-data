#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100", `undulating` is True if all digits in `n` form an undulating pattern, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #The program returns undulating, which is True if all digits in the positive integer string 'n' form an undulating pattern, otherwise it is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating pattern (i.e., each digit either increases and then decreases or decreases and then increases). It returns True if the digits form such a pattern, and False otherwise. The function assumes that `n` is at least 100, as it relies on the length of the string representation of `n`. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 100, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are provided.
