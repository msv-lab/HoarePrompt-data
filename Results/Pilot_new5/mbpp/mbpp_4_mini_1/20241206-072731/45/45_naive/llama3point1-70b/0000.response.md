To determine if the function correctly identifies undulating numbers, we need to analyze the provided program against potential cases of undulating numbers.

An undulating number is defined as a number where digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. For example, 121, 232, and 12121 are undulating, whereas 122 and 1234 are not. 

Let's examine the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Boundaries**: The loop iterates from index 1 to `len(n) - 2`. This means it does not check the first or the last digit. This could lead to incorrect results, especially for short numbers.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The function checks if the current digit `n[i]` is either higher than its predecessor and lower than its successor, or vice versa. However, it does not handle the case where two adjacent digits are the same (e.g., 1212). In this case, it should return `False` since undulating numbers should not have equal adjacent digits.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - A single-digit number (e.g., `5`) should return `True` since it trivially satisfies the undulating property.
   - Two-digit numbers should return `False` unless the digits are the same (e.g., `11`).

### Potential Failure Cases:

- Input: `121` should return `True`.
- Input: `122` should return `False` due to repeated adjacent digits.
- Input: `12121` should return `True`.
- Input: `5` should return `True`.
- Input: `11` should return `False`.

Given this analysis, we can see that the program does not correctly handle numbers with repeated digits or bounds checking of the first and last digits. 

### Conclusion:
Since there are cases where the program fails to identify undulating numbers correctly, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The program incorrectly handles cases with adjacent equal digits and does not check the first and last digits properly, leading to potential incorrect outputs for those cases.
