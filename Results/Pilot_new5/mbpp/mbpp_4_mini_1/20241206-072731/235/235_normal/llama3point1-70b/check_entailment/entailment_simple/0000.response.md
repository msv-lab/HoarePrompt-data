Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.

Here's why it works as intended:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an integer `n`, which is specified to be non-negative.
  
2. **Digit Extraction**: The expression `str(n)` converts the integer `n` to its string representation, allowing for easy iteration over each digit.

3. **Digit Summation**: The generator expression `int(digit) for digit in str(n)` iterates through each character in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and `sum()` calculates the total of these integers.

4. **Non-negativity**: The problem description specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, and the implementation does not attempt to handle negative values, which aligns with the problem's constraints.

Since the function correctly computes the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer input, it adheres to the problem description in all cases. Thus, the correctness status is True.
