The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `n % 10` to its previous value. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `n % 10` will yield a value between 0 and 9, depending on the last digit of `n`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, still greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10.**
