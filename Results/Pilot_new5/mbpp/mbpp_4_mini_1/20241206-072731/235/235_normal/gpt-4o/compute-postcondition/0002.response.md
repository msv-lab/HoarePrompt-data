The value of `total` is updated by adding the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`). Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 9. The initial value of `total` is 0, so after the operation, `total` will be equal to `n % 10`. The state of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is equal to `n % 10`**
