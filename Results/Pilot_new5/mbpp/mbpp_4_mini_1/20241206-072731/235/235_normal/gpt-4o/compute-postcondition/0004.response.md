According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and is now equal to `n // 10`. The operation `n // 10` means that `n` has been reduced by a factor of 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0 after this operation.

Since the only adjustment needed is to ensure that after the integer division by 10, `n` still remains greater than 0, it must have originally been at least 10. Thus, it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 before the division occurs.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `total` is equal to the remainder of the division of the original `n` by 10.**
