The value of `total` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10`. The operation `n //= 10` then takes place, which performs integer division on `n`, effectively removing the last digit from `n`. 

Since `n` is initially greater than or equal to 1, after this operation, `n` will still be non-negative, but it may decrease depending on its previous value. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `total` is equal to the previous `total` plus `n % 10; `n` is updated to `n // 10`.**
