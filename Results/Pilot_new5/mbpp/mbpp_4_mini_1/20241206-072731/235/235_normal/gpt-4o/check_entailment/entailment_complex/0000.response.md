Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n`. The assertion at the beginning ensures that the function is tested with valid non-negative integers: `345`, `12`, and `97`.

2. **Digit Extraction**: The function employs a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than zero. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and adds this digit to the `total`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `n` using integer division `n //= 10`.

3. **Final Output**: Once all digits have been processed (when `n` becomes 0), the function returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is initially `0`, returning `0`, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions validate the correctness of the implementation against known inputs:
   - For `345`, the sum of digits is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
   - For `12`, the sum of digits is `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For `97`, the sum of digits is `9 + 7 = 16`.

Since the function accurately computes the sum of digits for all non-negative integers and handles the edge case of `0` correctly, it adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated as true.
