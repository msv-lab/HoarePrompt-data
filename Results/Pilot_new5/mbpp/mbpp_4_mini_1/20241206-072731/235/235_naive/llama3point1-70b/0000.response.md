Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts it back to an integer, and uses the built-in `sum` function to obtain the total. 

This implementation handles all non-negative integers correctly, including:
- Single-digit numbers (e.g., `5` returns `5`)
- Multi-digit numbers (e.g., `123` returns `6`)
- The edge case of `0` (which returns `0`).

Since the program adheres to the problem description and successfully handles all potential cases, it is correct.
