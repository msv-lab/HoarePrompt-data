Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a three-digit number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1` performs the following steps:

1. Converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Calculates the number of digits in the number.
3. Computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Compares the computed sum with the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise returns `False`.

The assertions provided check the function against three cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` (as 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` (as 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 ≠ 259).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` (as 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 ≠ 4458).

The function handles any positive integer input correctly as there are no constraints mentioned for negative numbers or non-integer types. Since all test cases provided and the logic implemented are working correctly for the definition of an Armstrong number, I cannot find any case where the program would fail.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
