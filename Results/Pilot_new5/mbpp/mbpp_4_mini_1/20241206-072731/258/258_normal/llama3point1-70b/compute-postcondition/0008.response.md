To analyze the code snippet provided, let's first establish the impact of the code on the variables involved:

1. `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to its previous value.
2. `num_len` is equal to `num_len + 1`, which suggests the value of `num_len` will increment by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is equal to `num_len + 1` (implying that `num_len` was already defined before, thus it effectively results in an increase of value of `num_len` by 1).
- `sum` is updated to include the computed value of `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Now, let’s consider the variables involved:
- Let’s denote the previous value of `num_len` as `previous_num_len`.
- The new value of `num_len` will therefore be `previous_num_len + 1`.
- The value of `sum` will now be `previous_sum + int(digit) ** (previous_num_len + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code will be:
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `num_str` remains unchanged.
- `num_len` is now `previous_num_len + 1`.
- `sum` is updated to `previous_sum + int(digit) ** (previous_num_len + 1)`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to previous_num_len + 1, `sum` is updated to previous_sum + int(digit) ** (previous_num_len + 1)**.
