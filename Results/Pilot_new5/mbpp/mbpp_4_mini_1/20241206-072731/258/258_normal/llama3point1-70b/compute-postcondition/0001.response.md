The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be a string representation of that integer, which means `num_len` will hold the number of digits in `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`**.
