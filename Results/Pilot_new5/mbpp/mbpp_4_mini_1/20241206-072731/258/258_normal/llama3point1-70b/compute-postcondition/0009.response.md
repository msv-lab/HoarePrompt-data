The loop computes the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, each raised to the power of the length of the string. The loop will execute a number of times equal to the number of digits in `num_str`. If `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will have at least one character if `num` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning the loop will execute at least once for any non-negative integer.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is equal to the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
