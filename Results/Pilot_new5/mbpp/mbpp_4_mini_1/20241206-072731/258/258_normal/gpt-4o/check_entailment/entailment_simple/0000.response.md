Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

### Explanation:
1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is an integer such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. For example, `153` is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

2. **Code Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` begins by converting the number `n` to a string to easily access each digit.
   - `num_len` captures the length of this string representation, which corresponds to the number of digits in `n`.
   - The `armstrong_sum` is calculated using a generator expression that iterates over each digit in the string, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and sums these values.
   - Finally, the function checks if `armstrong_sum` is equal to `n` and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions included in the program test specific cases:
   - For `153`, the function returns `True` as expected.
   - For `259`, the function returns `False`, which is correct since 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 != 259.
   - For `4458`, the function also returns `False`, as it is not an Armstrong number.

The program correctly handles the logic for checking Armstrong numbers for any non-negative integer input, fulfilling the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
