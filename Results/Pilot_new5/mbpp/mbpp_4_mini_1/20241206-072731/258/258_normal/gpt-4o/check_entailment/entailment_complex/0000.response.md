The given annotated program correctly implements the logic to check whether a number is an Armstrong number according to the problem description. 

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, for the number 153:
   - It has three digits (1, 5, and 3).
   - Calculating \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which is equal to the original number.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` converts the input number `n` into a string representation to easily iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the number of digits and then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
   - Finally, it checks if this computed sum equals the original number `n` and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program check the function against known Armstrong numbers:
   - `func_1(153)` returns `True` as 153 is indeed an Armstrong number.
   - `func_1(259)` and `func_1(4458)` return `False`, confirming that neither are Armstrong numbers.

4. **Input Handling**: While the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer types, the problem description specifies only to check non-negative integers, implying that the function's behavior on invalid input types is not a concern based on the given specification.

### Conclusion:
Since the function meets the criteria set out in the problem description for non-negative integers and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers, we can say that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
