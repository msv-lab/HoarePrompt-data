To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the program itself, and the output hints.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to check whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

**Output Hints:** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is an Armstrong number, returning True if it is and False otherwise. The function does not handle any input validation, so passing negative integers or non-integer types would lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Initial Assessment:**
- The function appears to compute the sum of the digits of the number `n`, each raised to the power equal to the number of digits.
- It returns True if this sum equals `n`, thus effectively checking for Armstrong numbers.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- The program does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, as mentioned in the output hints. This means if `n` is negative or not an integer, the program may not behave as intended.
- The function is expected to return incorrect results or raise errors when given invalid inputs (negative numbers, non-integers).

**Reviewing the Output Hints:**
The output hints indicate that the function does not perform input validation, and this aligns with the function's logic since there is no guard against negative or non-integer values. This could result in unintended behavior, as Armstrong numbers are only defined for non-negative integers.

**Conclusion:**
Since the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically by not validating the input), it fails to handle inputs that are negative or non-integer types correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not account for potential invalid inputs and without proper validation, it can produce errors or incorrect behavior for these cases.
