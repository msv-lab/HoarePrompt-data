To determine the correctness of the provided program for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number, I will analyze the logic implemented in the code. 

The definition of an Armstrong number states that a number is an Armstrong number if the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

Here is the program provided:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the number (i.e., the number of digits).
3. It initializes a sum variable, which is incremented by each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. It checks if this sum equals the original number and returns the result.

**Potential Issues:**
- The function does not handle negative numbers or zero properly. An Armstrong number is traditionally defined only for non-negative integers. Since the problem description does not specify that the input can be negative or that zero should be explicitly handled, the program might yield false results for these cases.
- For example, if we input -153, the function will return `False`, which is appropriate, but it does not indicate that negative numbers are not considered. Similarly, an input of `0` would return `True`, which aligns with the definition, but the description does not clarify this.

Given that the program passes for all positive integers that are Armstrong numbers but doesn't explicitly handle the cases of negative numbers or provide clarification about zero, it can be considered incorrect in a broader context.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle negative numbers correctly, and it lacks clarity on whether zero is considered an Armstrong number within the context of the problem description.
