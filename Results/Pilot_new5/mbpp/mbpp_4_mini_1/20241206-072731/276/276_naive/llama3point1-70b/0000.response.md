Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has several issues related to calculating the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

1. The variable `middle_index` is initialized incorrectly. For a list of size `size`, the middle index should be calculated as `size // 2` rather than `size - 1`. This impacts the median value calculation.
   
2. The conditional check for whether the size is even is incorrect. If `size` is even, the median should be calculated as the average of the two middle elements at indices `middle_index - 1` and `middle_index`. However, the current implementation uses `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`, which would access out of bounds for the list.

3. The function assumes that the two lists are of the same size but doesn't handle cases where they might be empty or `size` is zero.

For example, if `list1` and `list2` are both empty, this would lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access elements in `merged_list`. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
