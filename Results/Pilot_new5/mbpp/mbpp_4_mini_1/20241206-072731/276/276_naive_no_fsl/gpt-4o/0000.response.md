Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases. Although the examples provided in the assertions work correctly, there are issues with the implementation that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the implementation assumes that the two lists are of the same size, as stated in the problem description, but does not enforce this condition within the function.

For instance, if we test the function with two sorted lists of the same size, the program may function correctly. However, if we test the function with two sorted lists that are not of the same size:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], 3)  # Example with different sizes
```

In this case, the first list has 3 elements, and the second list has only 2 elements. The function will still execute but will return a median that is not representative of the median of two sorted lists of equal size. This violates the problem description, which specifies that the two lists must be of the same size.

Thus, the code does not handle the requirement that both lists must be of the same size, leading to potential incorrect outputs for such cases.
