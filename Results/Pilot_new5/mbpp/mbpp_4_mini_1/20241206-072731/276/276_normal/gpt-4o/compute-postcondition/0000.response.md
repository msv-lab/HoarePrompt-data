`merged_list` is assigned the sorted value of the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. The size of both lists is `n`, which means `list1` and `list2` each contain `n` integers. The output state will reflect the fact that `merged_list` is now a single sorted list containing all elements from both lists. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers of size `n`, `list2` is a list of integers of size `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
