Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The primary issue lies in how the `middle_index` is defined and used. 

1. The `middle_index` is defined as `size - 1`, which is incorrect when trying to find the median for a merged sorted list of two lists of the same size. If the size of both lists is `n`, then the merged list will contain `2n` elements, and the middle indices should be `n - 1` and `n` for even-sized merged lists.

2. The median calculation in the case of even size uses `merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which incorrectly references the merged list indices. For two lists each of size `n`, the correct indices to find the median would be `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]` (or simply `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`).

3. The function does not handle the scenario where the two input lists are not sorted, which is a critical requirement for correctly calculating the median of two lists.

Therefore, the program fails to fulfill the problem description, particularly for even-sized lists, and thus does not always compute the median correctly based on its input requirements.
