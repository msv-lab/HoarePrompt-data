The variable `median` is assigned the value calculated as the average of two middle elements from `merged_list`. The `middle_index` is `size - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the first half of `merged_list`, and `middle_index + 1` is the index of the first element in the second half. Since `size` is even, this means there are two middle elements that contribute to the calculation of `median`.

The values of `merged_list` are not specified, but it's stated to be sorted and composed of integers from `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, `median` will be the average of `merged_list[size // 2 - 1]` and `merged_list[size // 2]`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `size` is even, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size // 2 - 1] + merged_list[size // 2]) / 2.**
