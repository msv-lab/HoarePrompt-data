The provided program aims to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, it does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the median for two sorted lists.

**Explanation of the issues:**

1. **Incorrect Middle Index Calculation:**
   The calculation for `middle_index` is done as `size - 1`. This is incorrect when determining the median. The correct middle indices should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` for even sizes, and `size // 2` for odd sizes. The current program assumes that the last element can be used directly for the median calculation, which is not the case.

2. **Wrong Handling of Even-sized Lists:**
   The program is meant to handle both even and odd-sized lists. In the case of even sizes, the median should be calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. However, the current logic retrieves the element at `middle_index` and the next element (which was incorrectly calculated), leading to incorrect results.

3. **Merging of Lists:**
   While the merging of two lists and then sorting them is correct, it is inefficient for finding a median from two sorted lists. A more optimal approach exists which can find the median in O(log(min(n, m))) time complexity using binary search, rather than merging and sorting.

Given these concerns, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **False**
