The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, and `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists. After executing the function body, it calculates the median value from the sorted merged list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, returning that median value based on whether `size` is even or odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers and a size, and return the median value of the merged list formed by those two lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`. It returns the median value calculated from the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`.**
