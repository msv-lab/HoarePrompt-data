To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic used to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

### Definition Check
The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes (NSW primes) are defined as the primes that can be expressed in the form \(6k \pm 1\) for some integer \(k\) and which are also prime numbers. The first few NSW primes are: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function checks whether a number \(n\) is prime. This implementation appears correct. It correctly identifies primes using trial division up to the square root of \(n\).

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function is supposed to find the nth NSW prime.
   - It correctly returns 7 when \(n = 1\).
   - It initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of NSW primes found so far, starting from 1 (since it includes 7).
   - It uses a while loop to check each subsequent integer to see if it is both prime (using `func_1`) and satisfies the `num % 6 in [1, 5]` condition.

### Potential Issues
Upon reviewing the implementation of `func_2`, it seems to miss some critical checks:
- The program currently begins checking from the number 7. It correctly counts the first NSW prime but does not take into account whether or not it accounts for all the NSW primes appropriately. 
- For \(n = 2\), the next prime number after 7 that is also of the form \(6k \pm 1\) is 11, which is correctly found. However, when counting for large \(n\), there may be an instance where it skips over a potential NSW prime due to how it increments `num`. For instance, after checking a number, if it is not prime or does not meet the NSW condition, it simply goes to the next number without ensuring that it covers all NSW primes.

### Test Case Analysis
- If we run `func_2(10)`, we expect to see the 10th NSW prime, which should be 31. However, if the logic doesn't cover the entire range correctly, it may skip some valid primes.

Based on this detailed analysis, the code logic does not guarantee that it will correctly find all the NSW primes due to the potential oversight in checking only consecutive numbers without skipping any candidates, which can yield incorrect output for certain `n`.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee correctness for every potential case, such as potentially missing some NSW primes for larger values of \(n\). Thus, it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
