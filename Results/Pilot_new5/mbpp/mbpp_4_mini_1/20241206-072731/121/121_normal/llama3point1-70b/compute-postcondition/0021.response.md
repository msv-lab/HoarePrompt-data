Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`. If `func_1(num)` returns true, and since `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, then `count` is incremented to 3. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 8. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
