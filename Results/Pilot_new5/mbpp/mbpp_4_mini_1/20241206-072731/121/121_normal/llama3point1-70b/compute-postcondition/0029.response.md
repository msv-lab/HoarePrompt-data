The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing it from 9 to 10. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 4, and `num` is now 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 4, and `num` is 10.**
