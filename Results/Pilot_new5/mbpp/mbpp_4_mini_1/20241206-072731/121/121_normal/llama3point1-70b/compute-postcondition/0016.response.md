According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to make any adjustments to the program state to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
