The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1`. The function has multiple cases for its return values: 

- Case 1: The program returns the value 7.
- Case 2: The program returns the value of `num`, which is 7.
- Case 3: The program returns the value of `num`, which is 8.
- Case 4: The program returns the value of `num`, which is 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific values based on the internal logic of the function, with the values being 7, 8, or 9 depending on the conditions met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns specific values (7, 8, or 9) based on certain conditions.**
