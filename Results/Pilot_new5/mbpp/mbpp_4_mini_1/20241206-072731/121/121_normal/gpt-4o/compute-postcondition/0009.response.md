After executing the code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next`, the values of `S0` and `S1` will be updated. Specifically, `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is `3`, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is `7`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial conditions were:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `S0` is 1
- `S1` is 3
- `i` is 3
- `S_next` is 7

After the execution:
- `S0` becomes `3`
- `S1` becomes `7`

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `S_next`) are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
