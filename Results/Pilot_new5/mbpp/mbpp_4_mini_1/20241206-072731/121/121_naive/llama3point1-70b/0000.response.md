Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as follows:

1. `func_1(n)` accurately checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n`, which is the standard method for prime checking.
2. `func_2(n)` starts with the first known Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7, and correctly counts subsequent primes (that are either 1 or 5 modulo 6) until it reaches the nth prime.

Since there are no apparent edge cases or issues with the logic in the provided program, it works correctly for all valid inputs of `n`.
