Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input string is empty correctly according to the problem description. According to the assertion, an empty string should return `True` because there are no differing characters, which aligns with the assertion. However, based on the problem description, it's ambiguous whether an empty string should be considered as having all identical characters or not. 

If we follow a strict interpretation that "all characters are the same" implies there must be at least one character in the string, then the function's return of `True` for an empty string is not logically consistent. Hence, the program's behavior is potentially incorrect based on this interpretation. 

Furthermore, there are no tests for this specific edge case in the assertions.
