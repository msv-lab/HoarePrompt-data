According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string containing at least 2 characters, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is equal to `first_char`, the loop will proceed to the next character. 

If `s` has at least 2 characters and `char` has already been one of the characters in the string, we need to ensure that thereâ€™s at least one more character left in `s` for the loop to execute again. If `char` was the first character in `s` during that iteration, then for the loop to be executed one more time, the next `char` will be the second character of `s`.

Therefore, if `s` has at least 2 characters and we are currently on the first character, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be set to the second character of the string, and `s` must still contain at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `s`**
