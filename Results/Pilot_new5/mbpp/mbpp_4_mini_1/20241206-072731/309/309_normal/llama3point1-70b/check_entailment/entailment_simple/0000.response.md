Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. 

Here's how it works:
1. The function converts the string `s` into a set using `set(s)`. A set automatically filters out duplicate characters, so if all characters in `s` are the same, the resulting set will contain only one unique character.
2. It then checks the length of this set with `len(set(s)) == 1`. If the length is 1, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether all characters in the string are the same. The function handles different cases such as:
- An empty string (returns `True`, as there are no different characters),
- A string with one character (returns `True`),
- A string with multiple identical characters (returns `True`),
- A string with different characters (returns `False`).

Since the function covers all potential cases as described in the problem, it is correct.
