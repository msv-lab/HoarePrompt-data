Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in the string are the same or not. However, the program returns `True` for an empty string (`s`), implying that all characters are the same (since there are no characters), which does not align with the usual expectations of such a function. 

In particular, the empty string (`''`) should logically return `False` because there are no characters to compare. Hence, the output for `func_1('')` would incorrectly return `True`, demonstrating that the program does not work as intended for this edge case.
