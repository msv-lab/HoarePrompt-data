Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as arguments. The function uses the `index()` method to check if the element is present in the array:

1. If the element is found, it captures the index and returns a tuple `(True, index)`.
2. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns `(False, -1)`.

This behavior is consistent with the problem statement, as it properly indicates whether the element is in the array and provides the appropriate index or -1 if not found.

All potential cases have been considered, including:
- The element being present in the array (returning `True` and the index).
- The element not being present (returning `False` and -1).
- The function will also correctly handle empty arrays.

Thus, the function works as intended for all specified inputs.
