Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an `element`, iterating through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found after checking all items, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The assertions provided in the program confirm its correctness for the tested cases:

1. For the input `[11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19]` and the element `31`, the function returns `(True, 3)`, which is correct since `31` is at index `3`.

2. For the input `[12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61]` and the element `61`, the function returns `(True, 7)`, which is also correct as `61` is at index `7`.

3. For the input `[9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56]` and the element `48`, the function returns `(True, 6)`, which is accurate since `48` is at index `6`.

The function handles the case where the element is not present by returning `(False, -1)`, as required. No edge cases are overlooked, such as empty arrays or elements that do not exist in the array.

Thus, the program works correctly for all potential cases considered.
