The code `frequency[digit] += 1` increments the value at the index `digit` in the `frequency` list (or array) by 1. Given that `index` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, this implies that there are multiple characters in `digit_str`, and thus `digit` can be derived from `digit_str` based on the current `index`. 

As `n` is a non-negative integer, it does not directly affect the frequency update itself. The impact of the code is solely on the `frequency` array. The previous value of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in the `frequency` array.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` must have at least one more character, `index` is incremented by 1, and `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.**
