According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digit_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. The loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`. Since the loop processes each character in `digit_str` one at a time, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` must be the next character in `digit_str`.

If `digit_str` has a length greater than the current index of `digit`, then the loop can execute again. If the current `digit` is the last character in `digit_str`, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, if `digit_str` has `m` characters and we are currently processing the first `m-1` characters, the next `digit` will be the `m`th character, which is not processed yet. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` must be incremented or set to 1 if it is not present.**
