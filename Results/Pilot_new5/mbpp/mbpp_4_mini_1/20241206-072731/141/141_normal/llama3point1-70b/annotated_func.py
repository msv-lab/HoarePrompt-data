#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n`, the count of each digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit, and the loop has checked all digits in `str_n`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that the count of each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer 'n' is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. It returns False if any digit's count exceeds its integer value, and True otherwise. The function does not handle cases for negative integers or non-integer inputs since it expects `n` to be a non-negative integer.
