The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. It returns False if any digit's count exceeds its integer value, and True otherwise. The function does not handle cases for negative integers or non-integer inputs since it expects `n` to be a non-negative integer.
