To determine the correctness of the given program, we will analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` according to the provided problem description. The goal is to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Here is a step-by-step examination of the code:

1. **Input Conversion**: The input integer `n` is converted to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. **Frequency Counting**: A dictionary `frequency` is used to count occurrences of each digit.
3. **Frequency Comparison**: The program checks if the frequency of each digit exceeds the numerical value of the digit.

**Test Cases Provided in the Code:**
- `func_1(1234)`: The digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4, each appearing once, which is less than or equal to their respective values. Expected result: `True`. The code returns `True`.
- `func_1(51241)`: The digit '1' appears twice, but its value is 1. Expected result: `False`. The code returns `False`.
- `func_1(321)`: The digits are 3, 2, and 1, each appearing once. Expected result: `True`. The code returns `True`.

These cases appear to be handled correctly. However, we need to consider additional edge cases to test the robustness of the implementation:

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
- Single digit numbers: `func_1(0)`, `func_1(5)`, `func_1(9)`.
- Numbers with repeated digits like `func_1(111)`, `func_1(222)`, `func_1(999)`.
- Edge case with `func_1(22)` where the digit '2' appears twice.

**Testing Edge Cases:**
- `func_1(0)`: Frequency of '0' is 1, compared to 0. Should return `False` (1 > 0).
- `func_1(5)`: Frequency of '5' is 1, compared to 5. Should return `True` (1 <= 5).
- `func_1(111)`: Frequency of '1' is 3, compared to 1. Should return `False` (3 > 1).
  
Based on these additional tests:
- For `func_1(0)`, the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For `func_1(5)`, the function will return `True`, which is correct.
- For `func_1(111)`, the function will return `False`, which is correct.

However, the failure for `func_1(0)` (in terms of meeting the constraints) and `func_1(111)` shows that the code does not handle all cases correctly according to the problem description. In particular, the issue arises with single-digit cases where the digit is `0`, and cases where digits exceed their count.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
