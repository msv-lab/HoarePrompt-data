To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function should check if the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function converts the integer `n` to a string to analyze each digit. It counts the occurrences of each digit in the string and compares it to the integer value of the digit.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Digit '0':** The program does not correctly handle the digit '0'. Since the frequency of '0' can never be less than or equal to 0 (it cannot appear), the function may return `False` when it should return `True` if '0' does not appear at all.
   - For example, for `n = 120`, '1' appears once (which is ≤ 1), '2' appears once (which is ≤ 2), but '0' appears once (which is not ≤ 0). The function would return `False`, though it should return `True` because the frequency of '0' is valid as it does not appear.

2. **Multiple occurrences of a digit equal to the digit itself:** The function does not account for cases where a digit appears exactly as many times as its value. For instance, for `n = 111`, '1' appears three times, and since 3 is greater than 1, it should return `False` (which it does correctly), but if we test with `n = 222`, '2' appears three times, which is also greater than 2 so it should return `False` (which it does correctly).

### Conclusion:
The program fails for inputs that contain the digit '0' or where the frequency of a digit is more than its value. The function does not handle the absence of '0' properly because it should return `True` if '0' is absent, yet the check could mistakenly return `False`.

Therefore, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
