According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `n`, which means it will execute `n + 1` times (including 0). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Since `i` is currently 0, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Thus, to execute the loop again, `n` must remain a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
