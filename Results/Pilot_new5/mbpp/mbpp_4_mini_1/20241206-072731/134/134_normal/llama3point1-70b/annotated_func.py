#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` is equal to the sum of all binomial coefficients \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) for even `i` from 0 to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of all binomial coefficients \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) for even `i` from 0 to `n`, which is stored in the variable `sum`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all binomial coefficients \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) for even indices `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.
