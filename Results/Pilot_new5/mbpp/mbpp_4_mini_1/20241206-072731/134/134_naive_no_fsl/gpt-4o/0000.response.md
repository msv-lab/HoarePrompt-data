To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the problem description and the implementation to see if it meets the requirements.

The problem description states that the function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficients for a given `n` are represented as `C(n, k)` where `k` ranges from `0` to `n`.

For even indices, the coefficients we should sum are: 
- `C(n, 0)`
- `C(n, 2)`
- `C(n, 4)`
- ... (up to the maximum even index that is â‰¤ n)

The sum of even index binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{1}{2} \left( (1 + 1)^n + (1 - 1)^n \right) \]
Which simplifies to:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 2^n + 0 \right) = 2^{n-1} \]
This formula coincidentally results in the same output as the function `func_1(n)`, which is defined as `2 ** (n - 1)`.

Now, let's verify the outputs for the provided assertions:
- For `n = 4`, the even index coefficients are `C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) + C(4, 4) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8`. The assertion `func_1(4) == 8` holds true.
- For `n = 6`, the even index coefficients are `C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) + C(6, 6) = 1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32`. The assertion `func_1(6) == 32` holds true.
- For `n = 2`, the even index coefficients are `C(2, 0) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`. The assertion `func_1(2) == 2` holds true.

Since the function correctly computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the inputs provided and adheres to the mathematical derivation, I cannot find any case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
