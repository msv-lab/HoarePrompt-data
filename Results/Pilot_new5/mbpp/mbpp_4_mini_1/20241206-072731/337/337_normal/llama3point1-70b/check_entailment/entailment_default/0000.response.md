Let's analyze the provided program and its corresponding description and output hints.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once in the list. If all integers appear more than once, it will return 0 as the sum of an empty list is 0. Note that the function does not account for the case where `lst` is empty, but it will return 0 in that case as well.

### Initial Assessment:

1. **Functionality:** 
   - The function iterates through each element in the list `lst`.
   - It checks if the count of each element `i` in the list is exactly 1.
   - If so, it includes that element in the sum.
   - This aligns with the problem description to find the sum of non-repeated elements.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty list should return 0, which is correctly handled by the program since there are no elements to sum.
   - If all elements are repeated, the return value should also be 0, which is handled since no elements will be counted.
   - However, the method `lst.count(i)` is called inside the loop, which has a time complexity of O(n). This could be inefficient for large lists, but it does not affect correctness.

### Output Hints Verification:

The output hints state that:
- The function returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once in the list.
- It will return 0 if all integers appear more than once.
- It will also return 0 for an empty list.

This aligns with the function's behavior, as confirmed by the analysis of the code.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, we see that the function correctly implements the requirement to sum non-repeated elements. It handles empty lists correctly and returns 0 when appropriate.

Since we found no case where the function fails to meet the problem description:

Correctness: **True**.
