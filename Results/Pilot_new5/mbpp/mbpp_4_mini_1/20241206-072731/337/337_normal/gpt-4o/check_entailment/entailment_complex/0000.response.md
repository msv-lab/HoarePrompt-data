Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` which returns the unique elements in the list, meaning that it sums all elements that appear at least once, regardless of whether they are repeated or not.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. According to the problem description, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. However, the `func_1` function would return `21` by summing `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which includes the repeated `1` when it should not.

This discrepancy demonstrates that the function does not correctly identify and sum only the non-repeated elements, thus failing to meet the problem description.
