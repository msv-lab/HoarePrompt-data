To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(lst)` and see if it meets the requirements to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Problem description:
The goal is to find the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the list.

### Program analysis:
The program uses the following code:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

### Evaluation of the logic:
- The function `set(lst)` converts the list `lst` into a set, which inherently removes any duplicate elements. 
- Then, `sum(set(lst))` calculates the sum of these unique elements.

### Cases to test:
1. **Example case**: 
   - For `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`: The unique elements are `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`. The sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`. This matches the assertion.
   
2. **Another case**:
   - For `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`: The unique elements are `{1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 45}`. The sum is `1 + 2 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 45 = 71`. This matches the assertion.
   
3. **One more case**:
   - For `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`: The unique elements are `{2, 9, 10, 12, 45}`. The sum is `2 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 45 = 78`. This matches the assertion.

### Identifying edge cases:
- Consider the input where there are no non-repeated elements.
   - For example, with the input `[1, 1, 1]`: The unique elements are `{1}`. The sum is `1`, but since 1 is repeated, the expected sum of non-repeated elements should be `0`.
   
- Input with all elements being the same:
   - For `[3, 3, 3]`: The unique elements are `{3}`, and the expected output should also be `0` since 3 is repeated.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for cases where the only elements are repeated, which means it does not correctly sum only the non-repeated elements. Thus, it does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not correctly return the sum of non-repeated elements when all elements in the list are the same, which should yield a sum of `0`.
