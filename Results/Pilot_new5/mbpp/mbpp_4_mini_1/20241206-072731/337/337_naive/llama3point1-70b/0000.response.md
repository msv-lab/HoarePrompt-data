Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element and sums only those elements whose count in the list is equal to one. 

For example:
- For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, the elements that are non-repeated are `1`, `3`, and `4`, and their sum is `8`.
- For the input list `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, the result is `0` since there are no non-repeated elements.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as an empty list, which results in a sum of `0`, and lists where all elements are repeated.

Since the logic aligns with the problem description and there are no identified cases where it fails, the program is correct.
