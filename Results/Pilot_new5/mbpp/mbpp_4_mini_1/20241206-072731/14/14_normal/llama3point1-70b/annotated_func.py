#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list 'arr', and False if all integers in 'arr' are unique.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False` if all integers in `arr` are unique. The function does not handle cases where `arr` might be empty, as this would result in `False`, indicating no duplicates, which is still a valid output.
