According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` contains at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `seen` is an empty set, which does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `arr` must have at least 1 integer, and `num` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `seen` is an empty set**
