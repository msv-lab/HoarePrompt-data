Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks for duplicates in an array of integers but does not return a boolean value indicating whether duplicates are present. Instead, it returns `True` if there are duplicates (meaning the lengths are different) and `False` if there are no duplicates. The problem description requires a function that should ideally return `True` if duplicates are present and `False` if they are not. 

A key case where the function does not work as expected is when an array with no duplicates is passed, such as `arr = [1, 2, 3]`. In this case, the function would return `False`, indicating no duplicates, which is correct, but the requirement to return a boolean indicating the presence of duplicates is not clearly fulfilled since the function's logic is inverted compared to standard expectations. 

Thus, due to this inconsistency in interpretation of the output, and the lack of a clear indication of duplicate presence, the program does not fully meet the expectations defined in the problem description.
