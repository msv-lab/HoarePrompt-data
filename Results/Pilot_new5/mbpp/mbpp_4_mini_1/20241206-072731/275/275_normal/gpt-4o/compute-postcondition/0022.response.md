According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop has already executed for `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, meaning that `j` can take values from `0` to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, allowing `j` to reach the new value at `i`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1 more than its current value, making it at least 2, to ensure that the range accommodates the new value of `j`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` must be at least 2.**
