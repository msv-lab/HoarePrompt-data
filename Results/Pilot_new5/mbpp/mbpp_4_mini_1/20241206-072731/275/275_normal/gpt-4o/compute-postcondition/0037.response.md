According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will run for all indices `j` from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is at least 2, meaning that `j` has taken values 0 and 1 in the previous iteration. 

To execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 3 so that `j` can take on the value of 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` must be at least 3.**
