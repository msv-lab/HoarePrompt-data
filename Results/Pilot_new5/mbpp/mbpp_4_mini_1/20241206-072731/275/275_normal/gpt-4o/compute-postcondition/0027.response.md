Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` is updated to reflect the new lengths of the longest divisible subsets.***
