To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` step by step and see if it indeed finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

1. **Understanding the Function**:
    - The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct since an empty list does not contain any subsets.
    - If the list is not empty, it sorts the list of integers.
    - Then, it initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where `dp[i]` keeps track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
    - It uses two nested loops to populate the `dp` list. For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
    - Finally, the function returns the maximum value from `dp`, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

2. **Correctness Check**:
    - The problem description states that we need to find the size of the largest subset such that every pair within that subset is divisible. The implementation in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts these pairs through the nested loop checks for divisibility.
    - The assertions at the beginning of the program test the function with various lists and expect outputs that match the criteria of the largest divisible subset.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
    - The function handles the case of an empty list properly by returning 0.
    - It also handles cases where all numbers in the list are the same correctly as per the problem requirement, since all elements would be divisible by each other.
    - The function assumes that all elements are integers, as mentioned in the comments. If non-integer types were to be passed, it wouldn't handle those cases, but this is not a requirement specified in the problem description.

Upon review, the implementation of `func_1` consistently fulfills the requirements set by the problem description. It appropriately finds the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **True**
