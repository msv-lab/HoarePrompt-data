Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is at least 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[0]` or `nums[1]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value or `dp[0] + 1` or `dp[1] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[0]` or `nums[1]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is at least 3. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for any `j` where `0 <= j < 3`.

Output State after the loop executes all times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `dp[i]` will be the length of the longest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`, determined by checking all previous elements in `nums` for divisibility. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the longest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`.**
