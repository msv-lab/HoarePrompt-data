According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop is set to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`. This means that for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. 

Since `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, it needs to be incremented before the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to potentially execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(nums) + 1`. 

Thus, the values of `nums` and `dp` do not need to change, as they are already in a valid state for the next iteration, but `i` must be 0 (the start of the loop) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is 0**
