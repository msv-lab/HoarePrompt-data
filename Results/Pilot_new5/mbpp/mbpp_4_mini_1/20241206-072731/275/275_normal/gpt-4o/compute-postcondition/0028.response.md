Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. If `i` is the index of the last element processed, then `dp` reflects the lengths for all elements up to `i - 1`, where `dp[j]` is the length for `nums[j]` and `j` is less than `i`.**
