The variable `dp` is assigned a list where each element is initialized to 1, and the length of this list is equal to the length of `nums`. The original state of `nums` is unchanged but now a new list `dp` is created. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` with all elements initialized to 1**.
