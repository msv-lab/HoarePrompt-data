To analyze the code snippet given the initial state:

Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is `i`, and `i` remains unchanged.

The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` evaluates the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, and assigns the result back to `dp[i]`. 

Since `j` is equal to `i`, the expression simplifies to `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i] + 1)`. This means that `dp[i]` will be assigned the maximum between its current value and `dp[i] + 1`. 

This implies that `dp[i]` will always be incremented by 1, as `dp[i] + 1` will always be greater than `dp[i]`, if `dp[i]` is not already at its maximum possible value allowed by the context (which isn't specified in this state).

The affected variable here is `dp[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State becomes:
Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is `i`, `i` remains unchanged, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[i] + 1)` which results in `dp[i]` being incremented by 1.**
