According to the code, the loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from 1 up to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `nums` must be at least 2 (i.e., `len(nums)` must be greater than 1). At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last value in the range, which is `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to reflect that `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's, `i` is 1**
