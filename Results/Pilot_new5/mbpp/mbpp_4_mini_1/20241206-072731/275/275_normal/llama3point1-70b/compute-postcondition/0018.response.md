According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `i`, which is equal to `len(nums)`. Since it is stated that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` will be at least 2. Therefore, the loop can execute because the range will produce values for `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`.

At the beginning of the loop:
- `j` will start at 0 and will be assigned the subsequent values in the range up to `i-1`.
- `dp` is initialized with 1's, which is essential for calculating the maximum length of divisible subsequences within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 0, and `i` is indeed at least 2. The state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**
