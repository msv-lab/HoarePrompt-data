The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between the current `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 1, respectively, meaning we are comparing `dp[2]` with `dp[1] + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[2]` is max(`dp[2]`, `dp[1] + 1`)**
