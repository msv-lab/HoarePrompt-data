To analyze the code snippet, we first note the initial values of the variables:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, filled with 1's.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 1.

The code executes the following operation:

```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

We will replace the variables with their specific values:

1. At the start, `dp[i]` is `dp[2]`, and since `dp` is initialized with 1's, `dp[2]` is 1.
2. The value of `dp[j]` is `dp[1]`, which is also 1. 
3. The expression `dp[j] + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1 = 2`.
4. The `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` operation becomes `max(1, 2)`, which evaluates to 2.

Now we update `dp[i]`:

- `dp[2]` is updated from 1 to 2.

No other variables are affected in this operation.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's except `dp[2]` which is now 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**.
