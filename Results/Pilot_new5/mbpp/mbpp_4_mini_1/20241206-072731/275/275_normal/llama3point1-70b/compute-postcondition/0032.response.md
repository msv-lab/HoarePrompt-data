The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, this means that a subsequence can be extended, allowing the length of the subsequence ending at `i` to be increased by 1 from the length of the subsequence ending at `j`. 

The previous value of `dp[i]` is retained, and the value of `dp[j] + 1` will effectively provide a count of the divisible subsequence. Thus, we can determine that `dp[i]` will hold the new maximum length of divisible subsequences that include the element at index `i`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` becomes `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
