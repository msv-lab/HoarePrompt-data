According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate `i` times, which means that `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `i` is currently set to 1, the loop will indeed execute once.

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `j` will be 0 (the first iteration). Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to `nums`, `dp`, or `i` for the loop to execute, but we must note that `j` will start from 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
