The code provided is intended to add a tuple to a list by converting the tuple into a list and concatenating it with the original list. Let's analyze the code and the description.

The code is as follows:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
```

The problem description states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list. 

1. **Initial Assessment**: The code takes two inputs, `input_list` and `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that results from concatenating `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple`. This seems to align with the requirement of the problem description. The function should handle empty inputs properly as well since adding an empty tuple to a list should return the original list.

2. **Edge Cases**: The following edge cases are worth considering:
   - If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is non-empty, the result should be equal to the contents of the tuple.
   - If `input_tuple` is empty and `input_list` is non-empty, the result should be the original list.
   - If both inputs are empty, the result should be an empty list.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the function should handle cases where either the list or the tuple is empty. They mention that the function should return a new list that reflects the contents of the non-empty input, and if both inputs are empty, it returns an empty list. 

4. **Agreement with Output Hints**: The output hints are consistent with the behavior of the code. The code correctly handles the cases of empty inputs as described in the hints. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases that the code fails to address based on the problem description and the output hints.

After evaluating the code against the problem description and output hints, it is clear that the implementation meets all necessary criteria.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, handling all known edge cases, including both empty inputs and mixed empty and non-empty inputs. The behavior matches the expected behavior outlined in the output hints.
