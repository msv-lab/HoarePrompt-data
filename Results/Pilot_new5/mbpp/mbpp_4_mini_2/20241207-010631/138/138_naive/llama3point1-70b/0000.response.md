Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array, and the second element is the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The use of the `index()` method and exception handling for `ValueError` appropriately handles all cases where the element may be in the array or not. 

I cannot find any potential cases where the code does not perform as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct in all scenarios.
