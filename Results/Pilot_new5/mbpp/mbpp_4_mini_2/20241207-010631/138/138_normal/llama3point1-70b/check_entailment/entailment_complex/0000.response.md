Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it always meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes an array (list) and an element as its parameters, which aligns with the problem's requirement of taking in an array and an element.

2. **Element Search**: The function uses the `index()` method of the list to find the index of the element. If the element is present in the array, `array.index(element)` will return the index where it is found.

3. **Return Value when Element is Found**: If the element is found in the array, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. This matches the requirement to return a tuple indicating that the element is in the array along with its index.

4. **Handling Element Not Found**: If the element is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, which fulfills the requirement of indicating that the element is not in the array.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The program handles both possible scenarios (element found and not found) and returns the appropriate tuples in each case. There are no edge cases or scenarios that the program fails to address as per the description provided.

Overall, the program correctly implements the described functionality and adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description.
