The problem description requires a function that takes an array and an element, returning a tuple indicating if the element is in the array and its index (or -1 if not found). 

Looking at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

The function iterates through the entire list and checks for the element. If found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

Initial assessment based on the code and problem description:
- The function correctly checks the entire array for the element.
- It returns the correct tuple format as required by the problem description.
- The function can handle an empty array by returning `(False, -1)` as expected.

Now, examining the output hints: 
The hints indicate that the function searches the entire list and correctly identifies the first occurrence of the element, returning `True` and its index, or returning `False` and -1 if the element is not found.

Both the code and the output hints agree with the problem description. There do not appear to be any edge cases that the function does not handle correctly, given the checks performed in the loop.

Since I cannot find any examples indicating the program does not work as expected, I will conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function accurately searches the entire array for the specified element and returns the expected results in all defined cases, including handling empty arrays. The output hints support the correctness of the implementation.
