Output State: **`arr` is a list, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if it exists, otherwise `index` is the length of `arr`, and `value` is the element at that index if `element` is found, otherwise `value` is not defined. If `element` is not present in `arr`, the loop executes for every element in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `index` is 0.**
