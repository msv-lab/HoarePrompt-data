The program description states that the task is to remove characters that have odd index values from a given string. The provided code does this by using a list comprehension to select every second character, starting from index 0 (which is an even index). 

Let's analyze the code:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join((s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)))
```

This code correctly constructs a new string by taking characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which indeed corresponds to removing characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). 

Now, let's consider any potential edge cases:
1. **Empty String**: The function handles this correctly since if `s` is empty, `len(s)` is 0, and the range will be empty as well, resulting in an empty string being returned.
2. **String of Length 1**: The function will return the same string, as the only character is at index 0 (even).
3. **String of Length 2**: The function will return the first character, as the character at index 1 (odd) will be excluded.
4. **Larger Strings**: The function will continue to remove characters from odd indices correctly.

Now let's consider the output hints:
The hints state that the function "returns a new string formed by joining every second character from `s`, starting from the first character." This aligns with the implementation of the code and confirms that it behaves as intended.

There are no discrepancies between the output hints and the code, and the logic correctly follows the problem description for all possible cases.

Thus, after considering the provided problem description, the behavior of the code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
