To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

**Problem Description Analysis**:
The task is to write a Python function that removes characters from a string that have odd index values, which means it should return characters located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

**Code Examination**:
The provided function is:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s`, checking if the index is even (`i % 2 == 0`). If it is, the character at that index is included in the resulting string. This should return the expected output based on the problem description.

**Test Cases Assessment**:
The assert statements provided:
```python
assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'  # Correct
assert func_1('python') == 'pto'   # Correct
assert func_1('data') == 'dt'       # Correct
assert func_1('lambs') == 'lms'     # Correct
```
These test cases confirm that the function behaves correctly for the given examples.

**Edge Cases Consideration**:
1. **Empty String**: If an empty string is passed (`func_1('')`), the function should return an empty string, which is indeed the case since there are no indices to process.
2. **Single Character String**: If a single character string is passed (`func_1('a')`), the function should return 'a', as the only character is at index 0 (even index).
3. **String of length 2**: If a string with two characters is passed (`func_1('ab')`), it should return 'a', as character at index 0 is included and character at index 1 is excluded.

Since the function handles these edge cases appropriately, it appears to be robust.

**Output Hints Validation**:
The output hints state that the function "accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are located at even indices" and that it returns an empty string if the input is empty. This matches the behavior of the code exactly.

Given that the function works correctly for the provided examples and edge cases, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly implements the requirement to return characters at even indices from the input string, handles edge cases properly, and matches the expectations set forth in the problem description and output hints.
