Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should remove characters with odd index values from the given string. However, the implementation does the opposite by returning a new string formed by joining characters located at even indices. 

For example:
- Given the input 'abcdef', the expected output based on the problem description should be 'bdf', but the function actually returns 'ace'.
- Similarly, for the input 'python', the expected output should be 'h', while the function returns 'pto'.

Thus, the function does not correctly follow the instruction of removing characters at odd indices, resulting in incorrect behavior as described in the problem statement.
