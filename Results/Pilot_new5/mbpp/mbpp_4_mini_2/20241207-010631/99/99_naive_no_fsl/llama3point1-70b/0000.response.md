Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of removing characters from a string that have odd index values. 

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the string, specifically selecting only those that are even (`range(0, len(s), 2)`).
3. It constructs a new string by joining together the characters located at these even indices.

This means that the characters at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are retained, while those at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., are omitted, which aligns perfectly with the requirement stated in the problem description.

Additionally, the function works correctly for all edge cases:
- If the input string is empty, it returns an empty string, which is the expected behavior.
- If the input string contains only one character, it returns that character, as it is at index 0 (an even index).
- For strings of any length, it accurately removes all characters at odd indices.

Therefore, after considering all potential input cases, the program performs as required and is correct.
