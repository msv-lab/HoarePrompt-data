To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the provided problem description.

Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.

Program:
```python
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Understanding XOR operation**: The function uses the XOR (`^`) operation to find differing bits between `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, the result of `a ^ b` will be a number that is a power of two. This is because a power of two has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation.

2. **Checking the Result**:
   - `xor_result != 0` checks if `a` and `b` are not the same.
   - `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of two, indicating that there is only one bit difference.

### Testing against provided assertions:
- For `(13, 9)`, the binary representation of 13 is `1101` and 9 is `1001`. They differ in one bit, which returns `True`.
- For `(15, 8)`, 15 is `1111` and 8 is `1000`. They differ in multiple bits, which returns `False`.
- For `(2, 4)`, 2 is `10` and 4 is `100`. They differ in multiple bits, which returns `False`.
- For `(2, 3)`, 2 is `10` and 3 is `11`. They differ in one bit, which returns `True`.
- For `(5, 1)`, 5 is `101` and 1 is `001`. They differ in one bit, which returns `True`.
- For `(1, 5)`, the same as above, they differ in one bit, which returns `True`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
Now let's think about edge cases:
- If we input `(1, 0)`, the binary representations are `1` and `0`. They differ in one bit, so it should return `True`.
- If we input `(0, 0)`, they are the same, so it should return `False`.
- If we input two numbers that are equal but larger than zero (e.g., `(10, 10)`), it should return `False`.
- If we input numbers that differ in two bits, for example `(6, 2)` where `6` is `110` and `2` is `010`, it should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether the two numbers differ at one bit position. Given that it successfully passes the assertions and handles the expected cases, including edge cases, I find no instance where the implementation fails.

Correctness: **True**.
