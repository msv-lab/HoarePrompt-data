The variable `xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`, which computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `xor_result` will be a non-negative integer as it is the result of the XOR operation between two non-negative integers.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `xor_result` is the result of `a ^ b`, a non-negative integer.**
