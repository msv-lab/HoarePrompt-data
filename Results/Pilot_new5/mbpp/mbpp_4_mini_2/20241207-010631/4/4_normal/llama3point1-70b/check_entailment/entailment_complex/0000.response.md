Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if two integers differ at only one bit position. In binary terms, this means that their bitwise XOR should yield a number that has exactly one bit set to 1.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers, `num1` and `num2`.
   - It computes the bitwise XOR using `num1 ^ num2`. The result of this operation will have bits set to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
   - The function then converts the resulting integer to its binary representation using `bin()`, and counts the number of '1's using `count('1')`.
   - Finally, it checks if this count is equal to 1, which indicates that exactly one bit differs between `num1` and `num2`.

3. **Correctness of Logic**: 
   - If `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit, the XOR operation will produce a number like `0b0001`, `0b0010`, etc., which all have exactly one '1' bit.
   - If they differ by more than one bit or if they are the same, the count of '1's will not equal 1, and the function will return `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If both integers are identical, the function will return `False` (as expected).
   - If they differ in exactly one bit, the function will return `True`.

Overall, the implementation accurately fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
