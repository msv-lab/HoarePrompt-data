The function accepts two integers `num1` and `num2`, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating that they differ by exactly one power of two. Otherwise, it returns False. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionality in the implementation.
