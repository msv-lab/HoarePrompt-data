Correctness: **False**.

The program does not properly handle leading and trailing spaces in the strings. For example, the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` is expected to return `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, but it will return `[[' red ', 'green'], [' blue ', ' black'], [' brown', 'orange']]` after sorting. The spaces affect the sorting order, and thus the output is not correct according to the problem description.
