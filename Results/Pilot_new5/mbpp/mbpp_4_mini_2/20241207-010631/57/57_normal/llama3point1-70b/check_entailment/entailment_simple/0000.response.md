Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function, `func_1`, which takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as its parameter. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist within `list_of_lists`, applying the `sorted()` function to each sublist.

The `sorted()` function sorts the strings in each sublist in a case-insensitive manner by using `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is not affected by the case of the strings. This behavior adheres to the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings.

Overall, the function returns a new list of lists, where each sublist is sorted as specified, fulfilling the problem description's criteria perfectly. Therefore, the program is correct.
