Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the expected output of the assertions compared to the actual behavior of the `func_1` function.

1. The `func_1` function is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It correctly uses the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist alphabetically.

2. However, the expected outputs in the assertions are incorrect. For example:
   - The expected result for `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but the correct sorted order of the last sublist would be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, making the correct output `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which matches but the above expected output is wrong in terms of sorting.
   - In the second assertion, the expected result has leading and trailing spaces which is not a proper string sorting behavior.

Due to these discrepancies in the expected output of the assertions, the program cannot be deemed correct. The function does sort the sublists correctly, but the assertions do not reflect the correct, sorted outputs, which means the overall correctness fails.
