Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly compute the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Let's analyze the function `func_1(n)`:
- The function creates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers, which is correct.
- However, the assertion tests do not cover all edge cases, especially when `n` is `0` or negative. 

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the expected output should be `0` because the sum of cubes of no numbers is `0`.
- If `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the behavior is undefined, but it should return `0` or raise an error.

Thus, the function does not handle these scenarios properly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the code cannot be deemed correct.
