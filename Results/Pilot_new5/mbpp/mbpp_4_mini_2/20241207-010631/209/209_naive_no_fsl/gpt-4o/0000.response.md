Correctness: **False**

The given program `func_1` is supposed to return the first element of each sublist from a list of lists. However, it does not handle the case where a sublist may be empty. For example, if the input is `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3]])`, the code will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty sublist. This indicates that there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, leading to an overall determination of incorrectness.
