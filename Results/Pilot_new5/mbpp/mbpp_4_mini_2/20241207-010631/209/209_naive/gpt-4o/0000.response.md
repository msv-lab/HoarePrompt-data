Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If any of the sublists in the input list are empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError` since there is no first element to retrieve. For example, if the input is `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3]])`, it will raise an error. This means the program does not meet the requirement in the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
