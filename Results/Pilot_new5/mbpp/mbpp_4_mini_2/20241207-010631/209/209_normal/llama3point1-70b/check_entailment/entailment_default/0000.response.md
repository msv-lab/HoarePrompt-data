The provided program is designed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of lists. The code utilizes a list comprehension to achieve this:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Initial Assessment**: The program attempts to iterate through each `sublist` in `sublists` and return the first element. However, if any `sublist` is empty, accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. Thus, it does not account for the case where any of the sublists might be empty.

**Output Hints**: The output hints state that the function will raise an `IndexError` if any sublist is empty. This aligns with my initial assessment that the code does not handle empty sublists properly.

Since the code fails to meet the requirement of handling all potential cases, specifically when encountering an empty sublist, the program does not fulfill the problem description completely.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program does not handle empty sublists, leading to an `IndexError`. For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, it will raise an error because it attempts to access the first element of the empty sublist.
