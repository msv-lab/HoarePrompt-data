Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists and return a new list containing the first element of each sublist. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each `sublist` in the provided list `lst`.
2. For each `sublist`, it accesses the first element (using `sublist[0]`) and constructs a new list with these first elements.
3. The assertions provided check the function against various test cases to ensure that it produces the expected outputs.

The test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for the following scenarios:
- For the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, it returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which correctly lists the first elements of the sublists.
- For `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, it returns `[1, 4]`.
- For `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]`, it returns `[9, 1]`.

The function does not have any checks for empty sublists or an empty main list, which could lead to an IndexError if an empty sublist is present. However, based on the problem description, it does not specify how to handle such cases, and the provided assertions assume valid input. Therefore, it satisfies the problem description with the inputs provided in the assertions.

In summary, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and consistently produces the correct output for the specified test cases.
