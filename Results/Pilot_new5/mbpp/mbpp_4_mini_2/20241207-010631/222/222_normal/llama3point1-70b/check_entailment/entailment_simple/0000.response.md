Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function must remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the annotated program only extracts and returns uppercase letters from the input string, leaving lowercase letters unchanged. 

For example, if the input string `s` is "Hello World", the function would return "HW" instead of removing the lowercase substrings ("ello" and "orld"). This indicates that the program does not perform the required operation of removing lowercase substrings. Thus, it fails to fulfill the stated problem requirements.
