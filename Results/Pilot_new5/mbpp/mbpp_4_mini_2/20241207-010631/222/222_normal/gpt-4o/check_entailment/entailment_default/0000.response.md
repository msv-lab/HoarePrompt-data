To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem Description:** The task is to create a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```
The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the string `s` and constructs a new string that includes only those characters that are uppercase. This effectively removes all lowercase characters, which aligns with the problem description.

**Checking Edge Cases:**
1. An input string that contains only lowercase characters (e.g., `'abcde'`) would result in an empty string, which is compliant with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings.
2. An input string with no lowercase characters (e.g., `'ABCDE'`) would return the original string, which is also correct.
3. An input string with mixed case characters (e.g., `'HelloWorld'`) will return `'HW'`, which is correct.
4. An empty string (`''`) would return an empty string, which is correct.

Given these edge cases, the function seems to handle all potential scenarios correctly.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints state that the function returns a new string containing only uppercase characters from `s`, and if there are no uppercase characters, it returns an empty string. This aligns with the logic of the code.

No contradictions or missed cases were identified between the program logic and the output hints. The function effectively fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
Since the function correctly removes lowercase substrings from a given string and handles all edge cases appropriately as per the problem description and output hints, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
