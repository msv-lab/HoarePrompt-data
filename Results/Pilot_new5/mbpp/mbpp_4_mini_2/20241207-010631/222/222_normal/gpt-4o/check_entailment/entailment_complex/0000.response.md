Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implementation of `func_1` only retains uppercase characters from the input string.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input `'abcDef'`. According to the problem description, the expected output should be `'DEF'`, as lowercase substrings should be removed. However, the implementation would return `'D'`, which does not fulfill the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings and retaining only uppercase letters.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the stated problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
