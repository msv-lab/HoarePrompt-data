Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully removes all lowercase substrings from the given string, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string `s`.
3. The condition `char.isupper()` checks if the character is uppercase.
4. Only uppercase characters are included in the new string that is constructed by `''.join(...)`.
5. As a result, all lowercase characters (which are not uppercase) are effectively removed from the original string.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs:
- For the input 'PYTHon', the output is 'PYTH', removing the lowercase 'on'.
- For the input 'FInD', the output is 'FID', removing the lowercase 'n'.
- For the input 'STRinG', the output is 'STRG', removing the lowercase 'in'.

Since the function correctly removes all lowercase substrings as required, it aligns with the problem description throughout various test cases.
