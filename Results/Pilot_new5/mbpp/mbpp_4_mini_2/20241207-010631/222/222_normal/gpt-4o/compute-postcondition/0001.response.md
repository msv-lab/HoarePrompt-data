The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string that may contain lowercase substrings. After executing the function body, since `s` may contain only lowercase substrings and no uppercase characters are present to join, the function returns an empty string. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` and return an empty string because it contains only lowercase substrings without any uppercase characters to join. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string that may contain only lowercase substrings, and returns an empty string as there are no uppercase characters to join.**
