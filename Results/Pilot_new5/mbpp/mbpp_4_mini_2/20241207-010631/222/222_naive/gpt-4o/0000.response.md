Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by using a list comprehension that only includes characters that are uppercase (`char.isupper()`). The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:

1. `func_1('PYTHon')` results in `'PYTH'`, which is correct as it removes the lowercase 'o' and 'n'.
2. `func_1('FInD')` results in `'FID'`, correctly removing the lowercase 'n'.
3. `func_1('STRinG')` results in `'STRG'`, correctly removing the lowercase 'i' and 'n'.

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and accurately implements the requirement to remove lowercase letters, it is considered correct. There are no identified edge cases that cause the function to fail the problem description.
