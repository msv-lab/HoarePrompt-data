Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the task as described in the problem statement. The problem requires rounding every number in the list and then printing the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, the assertion tests have incorrect expected results based on the function's logic.

For example, let's consider the input `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`.

1. Rounding the numbers gives: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`
2. The total sum of these rounded numbers is: `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18 = 7`
3. The length of the list is `9`.
4. Therefore, the expected result should be `7 * 9 = 63`, not `243` as indicated in the assertion.

Similarly, other assertions also yield incorrect expected values.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for these test cases.
