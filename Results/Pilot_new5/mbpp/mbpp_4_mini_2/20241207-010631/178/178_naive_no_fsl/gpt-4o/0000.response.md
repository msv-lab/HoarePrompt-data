Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the original list. 

The code works as follows:
1. It uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers`.
2. It sums the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
3. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list using `len(numbers)`.
4. It returns the result.

The assertions provided in the program test various cases, and they correctly check the expected output. Moreover, no edge cases or scenarios seem to be overlooked, as rounding behavior is defined in Python, and the function handles both positive and negative numbers.

Since all basic cases and edge cases have been accounted for and the outputs are as expected, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
