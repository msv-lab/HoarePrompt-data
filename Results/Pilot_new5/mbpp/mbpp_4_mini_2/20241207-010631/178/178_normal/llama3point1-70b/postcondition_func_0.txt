The function accepts a list of numbers (which can be integers or floats), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list. If the list is empty, the function will return 0, since the length of an empty list is 0 and the total sum will also be 0.
