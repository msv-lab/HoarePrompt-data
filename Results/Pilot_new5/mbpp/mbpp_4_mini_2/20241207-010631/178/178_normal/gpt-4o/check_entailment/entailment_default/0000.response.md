To assess the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description**: 
The task is to write a function that rounds every number in a given list, sums the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the list.

**Program Code**: 
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
```

**Initial Assessment**:
1. The code rounds each number using the `round()` function, which is correct.
2. It calculates the total sum of these rounded values correctly using `sum()`.
3. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list, which is also aligned with the problem description.

Next, we will consider potential edge cases:
- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be `0`, and thus `total_sum * 0` will yield `0`. The expected behavior is to return `0`, which the code handles correctly.
- **Negative Numbers**: The code rounds negative numbers correctly and includes them in the total sum.
- **Mixed Floating Point and Integer List**: The rounding and summation logic would work correctly regardless of whether the numbers are of type integer or float.

**Output Hints**: 
The hints state the function rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the total sum of these rounded integers, and then returns the product of this total sum and the length of the original list. They also mention that if the input list is empty, the function will return `0`.

**Validation Against Output Hints**:
The hints do align with the code. The rounding mechanism, summation, and multiplication by the length of the list are all accurately implemented, and the handling of an empty list to return `0` is confirmed.

**Conclusion**:
After thorough examination of the code against the problem description and output hints, I find no discrepancies or edge cases that would cause the code to fail. The logic is solid, and it addresses all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
