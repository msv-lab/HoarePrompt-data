The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `rounded_numbers`, which is derived from rounding the elements of the list `numbers`. The initial state of `numbers` is a list of real numbers, and `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers rounded from these numbers. Since `total_sum` is calculated from `rounded_numbers`, it will be a specific numerical value based on the contents of `rounded_numbers`. 

The values of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` remain unaffected, but `total_sum` now holds the total of the rounded integers. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers rounded from `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
