The function accepts a list of real numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the total sum of these rounded integers, and then returns the product of this total sum and the length of the original list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 because the length of `numbers` will be zero, resulting in a product of 0 regardless of the sum.
