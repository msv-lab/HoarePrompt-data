Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle edge cases properly. Specifically, if the input array has fewer than two elements, the function will attempt to compute a minimum difference without sufficient elements to compare, leading to an incorrect return value. 

For example, consider the input `arr = [5]`. The function will not find any pairs of elements to compare and thus will return `min_diff` as `float('inf')`, which does not represent a valid minimum difference between two elements. The problem description requires finding the minimum difference between any two elements, which cannot be done with fewer than two elements.

In summary, the function fails to handle cases where the input array contains fewer than two elements, making the program incorrect.
