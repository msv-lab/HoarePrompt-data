According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(arr) - 2`, which means that for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. The variables `i` will start at `0` and increment by `1` with each iteration. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can run, we need to specify that `arr` must have at least 2 elements and set `i` to `0` at the start.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
