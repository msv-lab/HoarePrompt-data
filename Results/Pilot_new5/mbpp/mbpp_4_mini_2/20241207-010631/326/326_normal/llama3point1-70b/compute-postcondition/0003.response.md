`diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are valid and defined. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])**
