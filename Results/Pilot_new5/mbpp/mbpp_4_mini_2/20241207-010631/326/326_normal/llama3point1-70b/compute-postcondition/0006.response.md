Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`. If the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` will be updated to the value of `diff`.***
