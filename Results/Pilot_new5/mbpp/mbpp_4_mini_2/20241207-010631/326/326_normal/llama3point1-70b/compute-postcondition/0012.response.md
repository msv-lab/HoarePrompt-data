The variable `diff` is assigned the value `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to `diff = abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
