Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array, it does not consider the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, regardless of their positions. 

For example, if the input array is `[1, 5, 3]`, the correct minimum difference between any two elements should be `1` (between `1` and `3`), but the program would only check the differences between consecutive elements after sorting, which would yield a minimum difference of `2` (between `3` and `5`). 

Thus, the program fails to account for all possible pairs of elements, breaking the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
