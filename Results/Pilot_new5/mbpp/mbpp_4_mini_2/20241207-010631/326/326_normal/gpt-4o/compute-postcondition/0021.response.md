Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2, it returns the difference between the two elements in `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function does not handle cases where `arr` may contain duplicate elements, as it will still calculate the minimum difference, which could be zero.**
