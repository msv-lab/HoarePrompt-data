The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is already defined as `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`; `min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`; `min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
