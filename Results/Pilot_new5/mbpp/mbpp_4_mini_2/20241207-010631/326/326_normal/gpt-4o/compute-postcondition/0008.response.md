The value of `min_diff` is updated to be equal to the current value of `diff`, which is `arr[1] - arr[0]`. Since `diff` is less than `min_diff` before the assignment, it implies that `min_diff` was previously set to a value greater than `diff`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to len(arr), `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and `min_diff` is now equal to `diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to len(arr), `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
