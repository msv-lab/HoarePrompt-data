According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr` and is stated to be greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2), this ensures that the loop will have at least one valid iteration (from 0 to n-2). At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

So, for the loop to be executed, the conditions are already satisfied. Specifically, `arr` must be a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The state of `min_diff` being positive infinity does not affect the loop execution but implies that it will be modified during the loop's execution.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to len(arr), `i` is 0**
