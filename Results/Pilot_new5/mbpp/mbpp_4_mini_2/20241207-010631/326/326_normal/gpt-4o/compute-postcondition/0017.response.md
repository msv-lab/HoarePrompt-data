Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
