#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in arr such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since the value of n, which represents the number of elements in arr, is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2) and n == len(arr).
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If `n` is 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `n` is greater than 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'. If 'n' is 2, min_diff is equal to arr[1] - arr[0]. If 'n' is greater than 2, min_diff is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2, it returns the difference between the two elements in `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function does not handle cases where `arr` may contain duplicate elements, as it will still calculate the minimum difference, which could be zero.
