Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array contains duplicate elements correctly. For example, if the input array is `(5, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)`, the minimum difference should be `0` (between the two `5`s), but the current implementation will ignore this and return `1` instead. Thus, it fails to meet the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
