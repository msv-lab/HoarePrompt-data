Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not handle cases where the input snake case string starts or ends with underscores, or contains consecutive underscores. For example, consider the input string `'_python_program_'`. The output would be `PythonProgram`, which does not match the expected camel case conversion of the string since leading and trailing underscores should be ignored. Additionally, the input string `'python__program'` would produce `PythonProgram`, but the correct camel case conversion should account for the extra underscore and the result should not include an empty component or should handle such cases differently.

Therefore, the function fails to cover all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
