Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input string has leading or trailing underscores, or multiple consecutive underscores. For example, if the input is `'python__program'`, the expected output should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the current implementation would output `'PythonProgram'` without any issue, since the consecutive underscores are not handled properly, and it would incorrectly treat them as separate components. 

Moreover, if the input is an empty string `''`, the expected output is also an empty string, but the current implementation would cause an issue when trying to capitalize an empty component. 

Thus, the function does not cover all potential cases as described.
