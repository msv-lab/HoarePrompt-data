Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the conversion from snake_case to camelCase as specified in the problem description. The key issue lies in how the first word is treated:

1. In camelCase, the first word should remain in lowercase. For example, the snake_case string "my_variable_name" should be converted to "myVariableName", but the program provided with the function `func_1` capitalizes the first word, resulting in "MyVariableName".

2. The `capitalize()` method in the line `word.capitalize()` capitalizes the first letter of each word, which is not the desired behavior for the first word in the camelCase format.

In summary, the program incorrectly handles the first word of the input string by capitalizing it, which violates the camelCase convention. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
