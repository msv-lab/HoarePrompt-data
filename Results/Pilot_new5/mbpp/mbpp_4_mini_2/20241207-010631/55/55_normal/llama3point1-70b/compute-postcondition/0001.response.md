The variable `camel_case_str` is assigned the value created by joining the capitalized versions of each word in the `words` list, which is obtained by splitting the `snake_case_str` at underscores. The `snake_case_str` remains unchanged, and the list `words` is derived from it. The capitalization of each word occurs as per Python's `capitalize()` method, which means the first letter of each substring becomes uppercase, while the rest remain unchanged.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, underscores, and possibly empty; `words` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at underscores; `camel_case_str` is a string formed by joining the capitalized words from `words`.**
