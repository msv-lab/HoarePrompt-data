To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the code and the problem description.

**Problem description:** The task is to convert a snake case string to camel case. 

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**:
   - The program splits the input string `snake_case_str` by underscores into a list of words.
   - It then capitalizes each word and joins them together without spaces to form a camelCase string.
   - However, the camelCase convention specifies that the first word should start with a lowercase letter. The provided code capitalizes the first word as well, which is not correct for camelCase format.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string should return an empty string, which is handled correctly.
   - A string without underscores should return the entire string capitalized, which is also handled correctly.
   - If the input string starts or ends with underscores, or has consecutive underscores, the output may not be as expected because the code does not account for these cases. It will lead to empty words being capitalized (which would just return 'Camelcase' for '_' or 'camelCase' for 'hello__world').

### Output Hints:
- The hints state: "The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores. It returns a camelCase string formed by capitalizing each word separated by underscores in the input string."
- They also mention the handling of an empty string and capitalization of a single word without underscores.

### Conclusion:
The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the code, but they do not highlight the issues regarding the camelCase format where the first word should not be capitalized. Furthermore, they fail to address the potential issues with leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the output.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- Input: `_example_input` would yield `ExampleInput` instead of `exampleInput`.
- Input: `__hello__world` would yield `HelloWorld` instead of `helloWorld`.

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
