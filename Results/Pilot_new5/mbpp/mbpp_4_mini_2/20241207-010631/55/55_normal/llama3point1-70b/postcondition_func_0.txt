The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores. It returns a camelCase string formed by capitalizing each word separated by underscores in the input string. The function will also correctly handle an empty string by returning an empty string. If the input string does not contain underscores, it capitalizes the entire string as a single word.
