Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert a snake_case string to a camelCase string. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Format**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_case_str` that consists of lowercase letters and underscores, which is exactly what the problem description stipulates.

2. **Splitting Words**: The function uses the `split('_')` method to separate the input string by underscores, resulting in a list of words. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to identify the individual words in the snake_case format.

3. **Capitalization**: The function then capitalizes each word using the `capitalize()` method inside a generator expression. This ensures that the first letter of each word becomes uppercase, which is necessary for forming camelCase.

4. **Joining Words**: Finally, the `join()` method is used to concatenate the capitalized words into a single string. This results in the correct camelCase format, where all the words are combined without spaces or underscores.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles an empty string by returning an empty string, as splitting an empty string yields an empty list, and joining an empty list results in an empty string. 

6. **No Underscores Case**: If there are no underscores in the input string, the `split('_')` method will return a list with the entire string as the sole element. The `capitalize()` method will then handle it correctly by capitalizing the first character of the string.

Since the function adheres to all the outlined requirements in the problem description and correctly handles various edge cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
