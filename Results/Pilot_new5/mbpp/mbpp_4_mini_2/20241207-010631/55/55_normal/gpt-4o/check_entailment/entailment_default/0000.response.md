To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the program itself:

### Problem Description:
The task is to convert a snake case string (e.g., 'python_program') to a camel case string (e.g., 'PythonProgram').

### Program:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components))
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a string `snake_str` containing lowercase letters and underscores, and returns a string formed by joining the capitalized segments of `snake_str` split by underscores, effectively converting it into camel case.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function splits the input string on underscores (`_`).
   - It capitalizes each component (the segments formed by splitting).
   - Finally, it joins these capitalized components together.

2. **Examples Provided**:
   - `func_1('python_program')` should return `'PythonProgram'`, which matches the expected output.
   - `func_1('python_language')` should return `'PythonLanguage'`, which also matches.
   - `func_1('programming_language')` should return `'ProgrammingLanguage'`, which again matches.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty String**: What should happen if the input string is an empty string (`''`)?
   - Expected behavior: It should return an empty string because there are no components to capitalize.

2. **Leading or Trailing Underscores**: What happens if there are leading or trailing underscores, e.g., `'_python'` or `'python_'`?
   - Expected behavior: 
     - For `'_python'`, it should return `'Python'`.
     - For `'python_'`, it should return `'Python'`.

3. **Multiple Consecutive Underscores**: How does the function handle input like `'python__program'`?
   - Expected behavior: There should be a check for consecutive underscores. The expected result should be `'PythonProgram'`, treating them as separate components.

### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hints verify that the function is supposed to take care of lowercase letters and underscores. However, they do not provide explicit mentions of the edge cases that have been considered above.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the code, the provided function does not account for edge cases like empty strings, leading/trailing underscores, or multiple consecutive underscores. In these cases, the function could provide incorrect outputs or potentially raise an error.

Thus, since the code does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reasons for Incorrectness:
- The function does not handle edge cases such as empty strings, leading/trailing underscores, or consecutive underscores correctly. For example, an input of `'_python'` would return `'Python'` (correct), but `python__program` would result in `['Python', 'Program']` which is still correct, yet no handling of empty strings or error scenarios is considered.
