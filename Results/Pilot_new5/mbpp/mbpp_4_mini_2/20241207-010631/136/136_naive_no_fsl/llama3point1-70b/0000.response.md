Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it correctly filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Key points:
- The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates through all key-value pairs in the dictionary.
- It checks the condition `v >= n` for each value `v`.
- If the condition is true, it includes the key-value pair in the resulting dictionary.

The program handles various potential cases, including:
- An empty dictionary, which correctly returns an empty dictionary since there are no entries to check.
- A dictionary with all values less than `n`, which will also return an empty dictionary.
- A dictionary with some values greater than or equal to `n`, which will return only those entries.

Since I cannot think of any input that would cause the function to not meet the problem description, the program is correct.
