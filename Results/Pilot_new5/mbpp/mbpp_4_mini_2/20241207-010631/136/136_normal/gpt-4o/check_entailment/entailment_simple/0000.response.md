Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the corresponding value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a dictionary where values are integers and an integer `n`, which is compliant with the problem's constraints.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` effectively iterates through each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`, checking if the value `v` meets the condition of being greater than or equal to `n`. If it does, that key-value pair is included in the new dictionary.

3. **Correctness Against Test Cases**: The assertions provided confirm that the function produces the expected outputs when tested with various inputs:
   - For `n = 170`, it correctly retains 'Cierra Vega', 'Alden Cantrell', and 'Pierre Cox'.
   - For `n = 180`, it retains 'Alden Cantrell' and 'Pierre Cox'.
   - For `n = 190`, it retains only 'Pierre Cox'.
   All expected outputs match the actual outputs of the function.

Since it correctly filters the dictionary according to the defined criteria for all tested cases, the function adheres to the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
