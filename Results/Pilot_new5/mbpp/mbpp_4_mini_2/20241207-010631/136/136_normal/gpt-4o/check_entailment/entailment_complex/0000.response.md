Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it filters the dictionary to include only entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's how the program satisfies the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function expects a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`, which is consistent with the problem description.
   
2. **Filtering Logic**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to generate a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This directly aligns with the filtering requirement specified in the problem.

3. **Return Value**: If there are no values that meet the condition, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary, which is also acceptable according to the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions are examples that check the correctness of the function against specific cases, confirming that it produces the expected output.

Overall, the function correctly implements the specified behavior of filtering the dictionary based on the integer `n`, ensuring its correctness in all specified scenarios.
