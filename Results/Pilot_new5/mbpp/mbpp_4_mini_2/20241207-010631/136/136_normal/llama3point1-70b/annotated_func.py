#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with values that are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary with keys from 'd' and values that are integers, where the values are greater than or equal to the integer 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If no values meet this condition, it returns an empty dictionary.
