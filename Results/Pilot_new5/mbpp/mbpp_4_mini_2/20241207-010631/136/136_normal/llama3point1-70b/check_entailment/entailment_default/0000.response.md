The code provided defines a function `func_1` that filters a dictionary based on the given integer value `n`. Specifically, it creates a new dictionary including only those entries from the original dictionary where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Upon reviewing the code and problem description, it appears to correctly implement the intended functionality. The dictionary comprehension iterates through all key-value pairs in the dictionary and checks if the value meets the condition specified (i.e., `v >= n`). If the condition is satisfied, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary; otherwise, it is omitted.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Dictionary**: If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the output should also be an empty dictionary, which the code handles correctly.
2. **All Values Less Than `n`**: If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the output will be an empty dictionary, which is also correctly handled by the code.
3. **Negative Values**: If the dictionary contains negative values and `n` is negative, the code should correctly include those values that are greater than or equal to `n`.
4. **Integer and Non-integer Values**: The problem specifies that the dictionary contains integer values. The code assumes this and should behave correctly as specified.

Next, we check the output hints, which state that the function returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. It also mentions that if no values meet this condition, it returns an empty dictionary.

Both the function's implementation and the output hints agree, and there are no contradictions present. The hints accurately reflect the behavior of the function.

Since the function meets the problem's requirements and handles edge cases appropriately without any discrepancies:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly filters the dictionary based on the specified condition, returning the expected results for all valid inputs, including edge cases.
