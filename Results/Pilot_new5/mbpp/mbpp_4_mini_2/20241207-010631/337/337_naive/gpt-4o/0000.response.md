Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1`, which is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, does not adhere to the problem description. The use of `set(lst)` removes all duplicates, resulting in the sum of all unique elements rather than the sum of non-repeated elements.

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements should be `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. However, the function will return `21`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements.
