The function `func_1` is designed to compute the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a given list. The approach used in the code is to convert the list to a set, which inherently removes duplicates, and then calculate the sum of the elements in that set.

### Initial Assessment
The code appears to correctly follow the problem description, as converting a list to a set successfully filters out non-repeated elements. The sum function then adds up these unique values. 

However, there are potential edge cases not explicitly handled:
1. **Non-integer values**: The output hints mention that a `TypeError` may occur if the list contains non-integer values. This means the function does not account for input validation, which is a crucial aspect of robustness in general programming practices.
2. **Empty list**: The function will return `0` for an empty list, which is consistent with the concept of summing elements but should be explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

### Evaluation Against Output Hints
The output hints state that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of unique integers, and also mention the potential for a `TypeError`. This aligns with the code's functionality, as the set operation will throw a `TypeError` if non-integer values are present.

### Conclusion
While the logic of summing unique elements is correctly implemented, the lack of input validation for non-integer types and the implications of handling an empty list could be considered as not fully adhering to the problem description's intent. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically regarding input validation).

Correctness: **False**. 

This conclusion is based on the potential for a `TypeError` with non-integer inputs, which indicates that the function is not robust against all valid inputs as implied by the problem description.
