The program is not correct according to the problem description. 

The problem description states that the function should find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the provided implementation of the function `func_1` calculates the sum of unique integers by using `set(lst)`, which removes all duplicates and sums the remaining elements, regardless of whether they were repeated in the original list. 

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the repeated elements (1) are included in the sum because they are omitted by the conversion to a set. This results in a sum of `21`, which includes repeated elements treated as unique, but it does not reflect the sum of non-repeated elements as specified in the problem description.

The expected behavior, based on the problem description, would be that for the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the function should only sum the elements that appear exactly once. In this case, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which would sum to `20`. 

Therefore, the implementation fails to satisfy the specified requirement.

Correctness: **False**
