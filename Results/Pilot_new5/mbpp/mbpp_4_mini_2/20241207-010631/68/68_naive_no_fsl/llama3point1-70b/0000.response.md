Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to compute the angle (phase) of a complex number. The function `func_1` takes two arguments (`real` and `imag`), constructs a complex number using the `complex()` function, and then returns the phase of that complex number using `cmath.phase()`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of possible test cases:

1. **Case (1, 1)**: The complex number is \(1 + 1i\). The angle should be \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) (approximately 0.785398).
2. **Case (0, 1)**: The complex number is \(0 + 1i\). The angle should be \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) (approximately 1.570796).
3. **Case (0, -1)**: The complex number is \(0 - 1i\). The angle should be \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) (approximately -1.570796).
4. **Case (1, 0)**: The complex number is \(1 + 0i\). The angle should be \(0\).
5. **Case (-1, 0)**: The complex number is \(-1 + 0i\). The angle should be \(\pi\) (approximately 3.141593).
6. **Case (0, 0)**: The complex number is \(0 + 0i\). The phase is undefined, but traditionally, it can return 0 (or raise an exception based on context).

In each of these cases, the computed angle is as expected according to mathematical definitions. The use of Python's `cmath` library ensures that edge cases (like quadrants of the complex plane) are handled correctly.

Since I can't find any input or edge case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
