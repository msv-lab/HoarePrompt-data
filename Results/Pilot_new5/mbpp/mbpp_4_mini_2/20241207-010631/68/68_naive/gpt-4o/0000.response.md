Correctness: **False**. 

The function `func_1` is intended to return the angle (phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts. However, the provided assertions are incorrect because they are testing against hardcoded values that may not be correct for all scenarios.

For example, if we consider the input `func_1(1, 1)` representing the complex number `1 + 1j`, the correct angle should be `Ï€/4` (or approximately `0.7853981633974483`). This case is not covered in the assertions, and thus the function does not guarantee correctness for this input.

Furthermore, if the imaginary part is negative (e.g., `func_1(1, -1)`), the expected angle should reflect the correct quadrant of the complex plane, which is not tested in the assertions.

Since the program fails to handle all potential cases correctly, it is incorrect.
