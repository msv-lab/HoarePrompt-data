#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase angle of the complex number represented by `complex_num`, which is created from `real` and `imag`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number formed by these parts. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this function, as it directly computes the phase angle from the provided parameters.
