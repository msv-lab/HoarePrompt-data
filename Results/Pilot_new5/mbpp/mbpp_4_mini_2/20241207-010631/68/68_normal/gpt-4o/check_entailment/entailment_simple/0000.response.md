The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. Inside the function, a complex number is created using the `complex()` constructor.
3. The `cmath.phase()` function is then called with the constructed complex number, which computes the phase angle of the complex number in radians.
4. The assertions provided check if the function returns the expected angle for various complex numbers, indicating that the function behaves as expected.

The use of `cmath.phase()` is appropriate for finding the angle of complex numbers, which ensures the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Since all parts of the program align with the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that it is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
