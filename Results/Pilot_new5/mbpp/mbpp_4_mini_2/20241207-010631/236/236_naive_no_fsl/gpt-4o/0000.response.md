Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether a specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it finishes the iteration without finding such a case, it returns `True`, signifying that the list is sorted.

The provided test cases confirm this behavior:
- For the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, the function returns `True`.
- For the unsorted list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`, it returns `False`, as expected.
- For another unsorted list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, it also returns `False`.

Additionally, the function will handle edge cases correctly:
- An empty list will return `True`, as there are no elements to violate the sorted condition.
- A list with a single element will also return `True`, since a single element is trivially sorted.

Since I cannot identify any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
