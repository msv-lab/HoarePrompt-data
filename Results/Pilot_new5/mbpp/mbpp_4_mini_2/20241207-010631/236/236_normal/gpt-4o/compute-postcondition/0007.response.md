According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `lst`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the current value of `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1` since `lst` has at least 3 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. Therefore, `len(lst)` must be at least 4 for the loop to run again since `i` is 2.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 2**
