Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Iterative Comparison**: The function `func_1` iterates through the list `lst` using a for loop that goes from the first element to the second-to-last element (index `len(lst) - 2`). For each element, it compares it with the next element (i.e., `lst[i]` and `lst[i + 1]`).

2. **Condition for Non-Decreasing Order**: The condition `if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If this condition is met at any point, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Return True for Sorted Lists**: If the loop completes without finding any instance where `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `True`. This indicates that all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test various scenarios:
   - The first assertion checks a sorted list and expects `True`, which the function correctly returns.
   - The second assertion checks a list that is not sorted (due to `17` being less than `20`), and the function returns `False`, as expected.
   - The third assertion also checks a list that is not sorted and again returns `False`, as it should.

Overall, the logic of the program fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description, ensuring that it correctly identifies whether a list is sorted or not for all potential cases. Thus, the program is correct.
