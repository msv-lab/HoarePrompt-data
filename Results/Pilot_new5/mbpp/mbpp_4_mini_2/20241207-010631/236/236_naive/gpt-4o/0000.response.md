Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted. 

The provided assertions test various scenarios, including lists that are sorted and those that are not, and they all pass as expected. The function handles edge cases, such as single-element lists (which are considered sorted) and lists with duplicate values correctly. Hence, the program meets the problem description requirements.
