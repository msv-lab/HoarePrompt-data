The function `func_1` is designed to accept a list of lists and return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements. The use of the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument suggests that it will evaluate the sum of each inner list and return the one with the highest sum.

Initially, based on the problem description, the code appears to perform the required task of finding the inner list with the highest sum. However, an important edge case is not addressed: if the input list `lists` is empty, the `max` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot operate on an empty iterable. This means that the code does not handle the situation where there are no inner lists to evaluate.

Now, checking the output hints, they state that the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined for an empty input list and that it may raise a `ValueError`. This aligns with the edge case identified in the previous analysis.

Since the program does not cover the edge case of an empty input list, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
