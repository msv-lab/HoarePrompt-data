Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input, where each inner list contains numerical elements (either integers or floats). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function operates:

1. It uses the `max()` function, which is designed to return the maximum element from an iterable.
2. The `key=sum` argument instructs `max()` to consider the sum of the elements in each inner list when determining which list is "maximum."
3. Therefore, the function effectively retrieves the inner list with the highest sum of its numerical elements.

Thus, it correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description: returning the inner list that has the highest sum. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements as described. 

In summary, the function accurately fulfills the problem requirements, confirming that it behaves as intended.
