The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. Initially, `max_sum` was negative infinity, and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than this initial value. After executing the code, `max_sum` will now hold the value of `current_sum`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is an empty list; `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist and is greater than the original `max_sum`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is an empty list; `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist and is greater than the original `max_sum`.**
