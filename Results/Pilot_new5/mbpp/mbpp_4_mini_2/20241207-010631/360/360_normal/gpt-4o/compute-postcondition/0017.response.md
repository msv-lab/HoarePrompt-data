Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists; `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`; if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to `sublist`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
