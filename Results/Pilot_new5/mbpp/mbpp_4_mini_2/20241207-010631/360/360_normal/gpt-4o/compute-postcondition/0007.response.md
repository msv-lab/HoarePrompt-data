Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least one sublist. If the sum of the first sublist (`current_sum`) is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is set to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
