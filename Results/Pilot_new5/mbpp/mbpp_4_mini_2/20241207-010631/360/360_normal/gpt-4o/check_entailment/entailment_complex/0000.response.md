Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists as input and return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that any valid sum from the inner lists will be greater than the initial value of `max_sum`.

3. **Iterating through Lists**: The function iterates over each sublist in the provided list of lists. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements.

4. **Updating Maximums**: If the computed sum of a sublist is greater than the current `max_sum`, the function updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.

5. **Return Value**: After checking all the sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which contains the sublist with the highest sum. If the input list is empty, it correctly returns an empty list.

6. **Test Cases**: The provided assert statements serve as test cases to confirm that the function behaves correctly for given scenarios, such as:
   - When there are multiple lists with different sums.
   - When there is only one list.
   - The function returns the correct list based on the maximum sum of its elements.

The function handles all specified cases correctly and adheres to the problem description by ensuring it returns the list with the highest sum of its elements. Thus, the program is verified to be correct.
