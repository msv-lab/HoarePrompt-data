`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` will be the total of the elements within that sublist. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist; `max_sum` is negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list; `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist.**
