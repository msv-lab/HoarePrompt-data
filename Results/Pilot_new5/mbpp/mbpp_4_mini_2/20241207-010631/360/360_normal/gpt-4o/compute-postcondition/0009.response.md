The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `sum(sublist)`, where `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is well-defined and will contain its own set of values. The `sum` function computes the total of the elements within `sublist`, resulting in a specific numeric value for `current_sum`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
