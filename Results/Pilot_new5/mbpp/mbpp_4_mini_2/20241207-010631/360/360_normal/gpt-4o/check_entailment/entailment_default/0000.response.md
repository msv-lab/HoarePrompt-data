To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and output hints, we start by analyzing both closely.

### Problem Description:
The objective is to write a function that returns the list within a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. If the input list of lists is empty, the function should return an empty list.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(list_of_lists)` is designed to:
1. Initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`).
4. If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
5. After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**: The function does not directly handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. As it stands, if the input is `[]`, the function will return an empty list; however, it would be beneficial to explicitly check for this case.
2. **Multiple Sublists with the Same Maximum Sum**: The program will return the first sublist with the maximum sum encountered during iteration, which is consistent with the problem description but may not be expected behavior if the user anticipates a different handling of ties.
3. **Negative Numbers**: The function should correctly handle cases where sublists contain negative values. The logic seems sound since it computes the sum correctly regardless of the values.
4. **Single Element Sublists**: The function seems to handle this correctly, returning the only element's list when it is the only sublist.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function should return the inner list with the maximum sum and that it should return an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty. This matches the code's intended behavior.

### Conclusion:
The code is generally correct in that it finds the sublist with the maximum sum based on the examples provided in the problem description. However, it does not explicitly check for the empty input case, which is a requirement of the problem description.

Considering the potential edge cases and the absence of handling for an empty input:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not explicitly handle the edge case where `list_of_lists` is empty as required by the problem description.
