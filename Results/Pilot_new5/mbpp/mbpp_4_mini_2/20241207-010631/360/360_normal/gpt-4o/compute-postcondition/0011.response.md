The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The state of `list_of_lists`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.**
