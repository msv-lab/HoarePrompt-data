Correctness: **True**

The function provided, `func_1`, takes a list of lists and returns the list whose sum of elements is the highest. It uses the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which effectively evaluates the sum of each sublist to determine which one is the largest.

Here are a few scenarios to confirm the correctness of the function:

1. If the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 1], [0]]`, the function will return `[3, 1]` because it has the highest sum of `4`.
2. If the input is `[[1], [2, 3, 4], [5]]`, the function will return `[2, 3, 4]` as it has the highest sum of `9`.
3. If the input is an empty list of lists, `func_1([])`, it will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, the function cannot be deemed incorrect based solely on this case.

Given that the function works as expected for all typical cases and there is no defined specification for edge cases like an empty list, we conclude that the function is correct.
