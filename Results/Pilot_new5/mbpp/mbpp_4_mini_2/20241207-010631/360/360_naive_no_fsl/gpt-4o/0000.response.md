Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist from the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

### Explanation:
1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and computes the sum of the current sublist.
3. If the current sum is greater than the `max_sum`, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list` to reflect the new maximum sum and the corresponding sublist.
4. Finally, it returns `max_list`, which contains the elements of the sublist with the highest sum.

### Test Cases:
The test cases provided in the assertions confirm its correctness:
- For `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the sublist `[10, 11, 12]` has the highest sum of 33.
- For `[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]`, the sublist `[12, 11, 10]` has the highest sum of 33.
- For `[[2, 3, 1]]`, the only sublist `[2, 3, 1]` is returned as it is the only option.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and accurately adheres to the problem description without missing any potential edge cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
