Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to account for the possibility of multiple sublists having the same maximum sum. In such cases, the program will only return the first sublist encountered with that maximum sum, which is not necessarily what the problem description requires. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]`, the program would return `[10, 11, 12]`, which is correct in this case. However, if we have `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [4, 3]]`, both `[3, 4]` and `[4, 3]` sum to `7`, but the program will only return the first one it encounters, which may not represent the requirement appropriately in cases where distinct lists exist with the same maximum sum. 

Thus, it doesn't meet the problem description for all potential inputs.
