Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. It will handle any valid input list, including:

1. An empty list: `[]` will be converted to `()`.
2. A list with elements: e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` will be converted to `(1, 2, 3)`.
3. A list with mixed data types: e.g., `[1, 'a', 3.14]` will be converted to `(1, 'a', 3.14)`.

Since the program produces the expected tuple for all potential cases of input lists, it meets the problem requirements accurately. There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for any valid input, thus confirming its correctness.
