Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that it must convert a list to a tuple. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `lst`, which is intended to be a list.

2. **Tuple Conversion**: The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list `lst` into a tuple. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with different lists and check if the output is the expected tuple. In all cases, the output of `func_1` matches the expected tuple, demonstrating that the function behaves correctly.

4. **General Case**: Since the function simply converts any list passed to it into a tuple using Python's built-in functionality, it will work for any list, regardless of its contents (as long as the contents are valid for a tuple).

Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
