Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, and returns the index at which the value can be inserted into the list without disrupting its sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module. This index returned can be used for various situations, such as inserting the value to maintain order in the sorted list.**
