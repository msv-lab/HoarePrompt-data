Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description by providing a function, `func_1`, that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The key aspects of the implementation are as follows:

1. **Functionality**: The function utilizes `bisect.bisect_right`, which is specifically designed to find the appropriate index in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. This directly aligns with the objective of the problem description.

2. **Correctness**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various scenarios:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4` correctly identifies that 6 should be inserted at index 4 (end of the list).
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2` correctly identifies that 3 should be inserted at index 2, maintaining the order.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4` correctly identifies that 7 should also be inserted at index 4 (end of the list).

3. **Sorted Input**: The program assumes (as stated in the comments) that the input list `sorted_list` is always sorted. This is crucial for the correctness of the `bisect_right` function. As the problem description does not mention handling unsorted lists, the function operates under the assumption that it will always receive a sorted list, which is appropriate.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description by implementing the correct logic to find the insertion point in a sorted list, thereby fulfilling its intended purpose.
