Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted, `i` is the index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining sorted order, or `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list` if `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`. If the loop does not execute, then `i` is 0 and `sorted_list` is unchanged, meaning it has at least 0 elements.**
