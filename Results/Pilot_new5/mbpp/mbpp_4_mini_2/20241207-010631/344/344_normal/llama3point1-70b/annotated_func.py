#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted, `i` is the index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining sorted order, or `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list` if `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`. If the loop does not execute, then `i` is 0 and `sorted_list` is unchanged, meaning it has at least 0 elements.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is the number of integers it contains in sorted order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index at which the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is less than or equal to any of the integers in the list, it returns the index of the first such integer. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be appended at the end of the list.
