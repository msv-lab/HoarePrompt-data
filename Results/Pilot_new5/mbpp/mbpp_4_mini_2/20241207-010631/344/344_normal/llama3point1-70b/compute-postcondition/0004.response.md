According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `sorted_list`. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`, the loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1, and the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`.

Since `sorted_list` has at least one element (the first one being less than `value`), the length of `sorted_list` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time with `i` being 1.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order that must have at least 2 elements, `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted, `i` is 1**
