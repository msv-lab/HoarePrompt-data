Correctness: **False**.

The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. However, the `assert` statements provided in the program do not correctly validate the output for all potential cases.

For instance, if we consider the following inputs:
1. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the expected insertion point should be `2`, which is correct.
2. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the expected insertion point is `4`, indicating that `6` should be inserted at the end of the list, which is also correct. 
3. However, for `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the expected insertion point should indeed be `4`, which is again correct. 

Despite these assertions passing, the logic of the function does not fully comply with the requirement of "locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order" since it does not handle cases where the value is equal to a list element effectively. 

For example, when the value `5` is passed into `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 5)`, the expected insertion point should be `3` (to the left of the existing `5`), but it would incorrectly return `4` because `bisect_right` gives the position to insert it after all existing `5`s. This demonstrates that the program does not handle every potential case as required by the problem description.
