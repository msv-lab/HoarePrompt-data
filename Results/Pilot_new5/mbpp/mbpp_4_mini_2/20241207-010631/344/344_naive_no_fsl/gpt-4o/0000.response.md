Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. While the function appears to work for the given assertions, it does not handle cases where the list contains duplicate values correctly.

For example, consider the input:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 2, 4, 5], 2) == 3
```

According to the problem description, the insertion point for `2` in the list `[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]` should be `2`, which is the index at which `2` can be inserted without changing the order. However, `bisect.bisect_right` returns `3`, which is not the correct insertion point for the specified value.

Since there exists at least one input case where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is determined to be false.
