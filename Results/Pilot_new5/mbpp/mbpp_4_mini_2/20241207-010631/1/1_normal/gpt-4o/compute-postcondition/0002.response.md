The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any type of elements. After executing the function, it returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements of `list1` and `list2`, represented by the set `common_elements`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a tuple of the sorted common elements found in both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements of list1 and list2.**
