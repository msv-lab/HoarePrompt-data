Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. While it correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two lists as a sorted tuple, it fails to account for the scenario where either of the input lists (`list1` or `list2`) is `None`. In such cases, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert `None` to a set, which is not addressed in the annotations. 

Additionally, the function does not specify how to handle when one or both lists are empty, although the current implementation will return an empty tuple in those cases, which aligns with the problem description. However, the lack of handling for `None` inputs means the function does not robustly satisfy all the requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, while it performs correctly for valid inputs, the failure to handle potential `None` inputs leads to the conclusion that the program does not fully satisfy the problem description.
