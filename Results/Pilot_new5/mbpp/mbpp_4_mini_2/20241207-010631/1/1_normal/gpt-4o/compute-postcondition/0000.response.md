The variable `common_elements` is assigned the set of common elements found in both `list1` and `list2`. The other variables `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, but `common_elements` will now hold the intersection of those two lists as a set. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any type of elements; `common_elements` is a set containing the common elements of `list1` and `list2`.**
