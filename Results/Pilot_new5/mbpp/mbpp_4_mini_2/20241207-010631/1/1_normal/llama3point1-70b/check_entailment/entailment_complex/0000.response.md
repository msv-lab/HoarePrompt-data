Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that finds the shared elements from two given lists, and the program achieves this by following these steps:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, both of which are lists as specified in the provided annotations.

2. **Set Intersection**: The function converts both lists into sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`. This is crucial because sets in Python automatically handle duplicate elements and allow for efficient intersection operations.

3. **Returning the Result**: The intersection of the two sets is calculated using the `&` operator, which gives the common elements. The result of this intersection is then converted back into a tuple, fulfilling the requirement to return a tuple containing the shared elements.

4. **Handling No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements between the two lists, the intersection will result in an empty set. When converted to a tuple, this will return an empty tuple, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

Overall, the function effectively identifies shared elements between the two lists and returns them in the correct format, thus adhering fully to the requirements outlined in the problem description.
