In the provided code snippet, `end` is assigned the value `start + len(substring)`. The variable `len(substring)` will yield a positive integer since `substring` is a non-empty string. Thus, `end` will be calculated by adding the length of the `substring` to the value of `start`, which is a non-negative integer. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but we will update the value of `end` based on the calculation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is a non-negative integer, `end` is `start + len(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is a non-negative integer, `end` is `start + len(substring)`**.
