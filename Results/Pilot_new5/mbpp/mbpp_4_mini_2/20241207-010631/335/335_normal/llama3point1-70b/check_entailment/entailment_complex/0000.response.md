Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accomplishes the following:

1. **Check for Substring Presence**: The program uses the `find()` method to check if the `substring` exists within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, it returns `None`, which aligns with the behavior described in the problem statement.

2. **Return Substring and Positions**: When the `substring` is found, the program calculates the starting and ending indices of the substring within the string. It returns a tuple consisting of the `substring`, the starting index, and the inclusive ending index, which is consistent with the requirement to report the occurrence and position of the substring.

3. **Handling of Non-empty Inputs**: The annotations specify that both `string` and `substring` are non-empty, which simplifies the checks that need to be made and prevents edge cases like empty strings from affecting the logic of the program.

The program covers all necessary conditions outlined in the problem description, including returning `None` when there are no matches and returning the required position information when a match is found. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem's requirements in all cases.
