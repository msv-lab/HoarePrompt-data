The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where `lst` is empty, which will return `True` because all (zero) elements trivially equal `element`. There are no exceptions or errors accounted for in the implementation, making it straightforward and robust for the purpose described.
