Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(lst, element)` that checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function takes a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`). The comments clearly state that `lst` can contain elements of any type, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

2. **Equality Check**: The code uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check if each item in the list is equal to `element`. This correctly implements the logic of checking equality for every item in the list.

3. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles the edge case where `lst` is empty. According to the definition of the `all()` function, it will return `True` when called on an empty iterable, which aligns with the statement that "all (zero) elements trivially equal `element`."

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if all items are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise, which directly matches the requirements outlined in the problem description.

In conclusion, the function performs the exact task described in the problem statement and thus is correct in its implementation.
