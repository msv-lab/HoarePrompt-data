Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(lst, element)` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs. It checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. **Return Values**:
   - If any item in the list is not equal to the `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. This aligns with the requirement that if any element differs from the specified value, the result should reflect that not all items are equal.
   - If the loop completes without finding any differences (which means all elements are equal to the `element`), it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the list are indeed equal to the given value.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program correctly handles the case where the input list is empty. In Python, the function will return `True` because the loop will not execute and it will reach the return statement that returns `True`. This behavior is consistent with the logical interpretation that an empty list satisfies the condition of all elements being equal to the `element`, as there are no elements to contradict this.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, including:
   - A case where not all elements match (returns `False`).
   - A case where all elements match (returns `True`).
   - A case with different types (ensures type flexibility).

Overall, the program accurately fulfills the problem's requirements across all described scenarios, thus validating its correctness.
