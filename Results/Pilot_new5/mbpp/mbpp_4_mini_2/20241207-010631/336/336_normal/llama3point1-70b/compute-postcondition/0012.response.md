The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function checks the elements of the list at odd indices and returns different values based on certain conditions. 

- If the current index is odd and the value at that index is even, the function returns `False`.
- There are additional conditions that also result in returning `False`.
- If none of the conditions for returning `False` are met (i.e., there are no even elements at odd indices), the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if there are no even elements at odd indices; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if there are no even elements at odd indices in the list; otherwise, it returns False.**
