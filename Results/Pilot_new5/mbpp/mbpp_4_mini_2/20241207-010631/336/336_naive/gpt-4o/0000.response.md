Correctness: **False**.

The program states that it should check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, it does not handle the case correctly when the list is empty or has no odd indexed elements. For instance, if we test the function with an empty list `[]`, the function would return `True`, which does not align with the problem description, as there are no odd indexed elements to evaluate. This indicates that the program does not correctly adhere to the requirements for all potential cases.
