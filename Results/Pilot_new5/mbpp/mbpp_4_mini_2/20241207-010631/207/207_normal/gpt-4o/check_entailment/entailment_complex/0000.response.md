Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`, it does not handle the potential case of negative values or ensure that the inputs are valid numbers. The problem description states that the function must find the area of a rectangle, but it can only be considered correct if it handles all scenarios, including invalid inputs. 

For instance, if the user were to input a negative value or a non-numeric type (like a string), the program would not return a valid area and may even raise an error. This lack of input validation and error handling means that the program cannot be considered correct in all potential cases, which is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
