Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality to find the area of a rectangle based on the problem description. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(length, width)` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`. According to the problem description, these parameters are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. The function computes the area of the rectangle using the formula `length * width`, which is exactly how the area of a rectangle is defined.

3. The annotated assertions test various cases of the function. Each assertion checks that the function returns the expected area for given dimensions:
   - `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which is correct.

4. The function will work correctly for all non-negative integer or float inputs, as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, consistently calculating the area of a rectangle for valid inputs.
