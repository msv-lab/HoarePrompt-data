Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description in all potential cases. While the function does calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` and `width`, it does not handle negative input values or check for invalid data types. According to the problem description, the parameters `length` and `width` are expected to be non-negative integers or floats. 

If negative values are provided as inputs, the function will still execute and return a negative area, which is not valid for the area of a rectangle. For example, calling `func_1(-5, 10)` would return `-50`, which contradicts the expectation of calculating a valid area. Additionally, if non-numeric types are passed, such as strings or lists, the function would raise a TypeError.

Therefore, the function's lack of input validation means that it does not always fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
