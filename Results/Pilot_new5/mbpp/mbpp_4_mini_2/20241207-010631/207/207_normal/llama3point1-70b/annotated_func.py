#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as length multiplied by width, where length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. However, the function does not handle negative input values or check for invalid data types, so if negative values or non-numeric types are passed, it may lead to erroneous results or exceptions.
