To find the volume of a triangular prism, the formula used is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Area of base} \times \text{Height} \]

The area of the triangular base can be calculated using:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Thus, the formula for the volume of a triangular prism becomes:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\right) \times l \]

In the provided program, the function `func_1` calculates the volume as follows:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

This implementation is mathematically accurate. It properly follows the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. 

**Testing for edge cases:**

1. **Zero dimensions**: If any of the dimensions (base `b`, height `h`, or length `l`) is zero, the volume should be zero. For example:
   - `func_1(0, 5, 10)` should return `0`.
   - `func_1(5, 0, 10)` should return `0`.
   - `func_1(5, 5, 0)` should return `0`.

2. **Negative dimensions**: The volume should not be calculated for negative dimensions; however, the function does not handle this explicitly. For example:
   - `func_1(-5, 5, 10)` could return a negative volume, which does not make sense in the context of physical dimensions.

Since the function does not account for negative dimensions, it can produce incorrect results in those cases.

Correctness: **False**.
