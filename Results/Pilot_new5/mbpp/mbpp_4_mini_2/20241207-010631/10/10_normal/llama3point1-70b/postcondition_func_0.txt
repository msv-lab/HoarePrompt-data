The function accepts three positive numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base length, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (base length * height / 2) * length. There are no checks for negative or zero values for the input parameters, so the function assumes they are always positive.
