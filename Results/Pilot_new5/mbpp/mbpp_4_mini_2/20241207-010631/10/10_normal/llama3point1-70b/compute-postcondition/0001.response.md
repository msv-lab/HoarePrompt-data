The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All three parameters are positive numbers representing the base length, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. The function calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((\text{base length} \times \text{height} / 2) \times \text{length}\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, and return the volume of the triangular prism based on these dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters b, h, and l, which are positive numbers, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base length * height / 2) * length.**
