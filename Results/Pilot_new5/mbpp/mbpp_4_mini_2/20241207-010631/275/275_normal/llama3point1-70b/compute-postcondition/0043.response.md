The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. If `nums` is an empty list, the function returns 0. If `nums` is not empty, the function returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of 1's. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return 0 if the list is empty, or the length of the longest divisible subsequence if it is not empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums (a list of integers) and returns 0 if nums is empty. If nums is not empty, it returns the length of the longest subsequence where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements.**
