Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, for `j` taking values 0 and 1. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
