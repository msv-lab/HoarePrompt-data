The variable `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `j` can take values 0 and 1, this means that we are comparing the current length of the longest subsequence at index `i` with the length of the subsequence at indices `j` (either 0 or 1) plus 1.

Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we can say that `dp[j] + 1` represents a valid extension of the subsequence at index `j`. The exact values of `dp[i]`, `dp[0]`, and `dp[1]` are not specified, but the operation guarantees that `dp[i]` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` can take values 0 and 1; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
