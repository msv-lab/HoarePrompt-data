The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the conditions, we know that `i` is greater than `j + 1`, and `j` is equal to `i - 1`. This implies that `dp[j]` corresponds to `dp[i - 1]`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but `dp[i]` is updated based on its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements; `i` must be greater than `j + 1`, where `j` is now equal to `i - 1; dp[i]` is max(`dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1] + 1`).**
