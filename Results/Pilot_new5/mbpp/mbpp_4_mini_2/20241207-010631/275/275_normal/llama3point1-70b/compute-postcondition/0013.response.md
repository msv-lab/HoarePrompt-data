According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates through the range of `i`, meaning it will execute for each value of `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented to `j + 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `i`. 

Since `j` has been incremented to `j + 1`, and the previous value of `j` was `j`, it must now equal `i - 1` to allow for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `j + 1`, which is now `i`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` must be greater than `j + 1`, where `j` is now equal to `i - 1`.**
