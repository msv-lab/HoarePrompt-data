You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the current value of 'nums' is an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by any of the previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the values of `dp` may vary depending on the divisibility relationships among elements of `nums`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of `1`s.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which represents the length of the longest subsequence of 'nums' where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements. If the loop does not execute, 'dp' remains a list of 1's.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
