According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1, meaning the range of `j` needs to be valid. Since `i` is given as 1, the loop will run exactly once. The state of `nums` and `dp` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the overall program context. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be 0, as it is initialized at 0 in the loop range. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `j` is 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
