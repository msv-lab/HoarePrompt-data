The `sort()` method is called on the `nums` list, which rearranges the elements of the list in ascending order. Since `nums` is not empty, it will contain at least one element, and its order will change based on its current values. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
