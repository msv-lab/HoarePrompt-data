According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts at index 1 and continues until the last index of the list, which is `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` corresponds to the last element processed in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, and thus must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, it implies that the next value of `i` should be equal to 2, which corresponds to the third element in the `nums` list.

State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2**
