Output State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by any of the previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the values of `dp` may vary depending on the divisibility relationships among elements of `nums`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of `1`s.**
