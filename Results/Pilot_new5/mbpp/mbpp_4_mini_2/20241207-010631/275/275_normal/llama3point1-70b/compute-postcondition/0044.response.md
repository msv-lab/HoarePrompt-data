Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it returns the length of the longest subsequence where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements in the sorted list. If no such subsequence exists, the function returns 1, as each individual element is a subsequence of length 1. **
