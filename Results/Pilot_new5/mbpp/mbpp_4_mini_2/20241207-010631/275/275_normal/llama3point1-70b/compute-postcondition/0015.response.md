Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is greater than `j + 1` where `j` is equal to `i - 1`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp`.***
