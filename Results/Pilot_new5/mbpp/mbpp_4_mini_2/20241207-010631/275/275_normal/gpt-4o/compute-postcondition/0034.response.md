According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `dp` is a list representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence.

Given that `j` ranges from 0 to `i - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will take on the value `i - 1` during the last iteration, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2 for `j` to be valid.

Thus, if `i` is currently some value `k` (where `k` is the current value of `i`), then `i` will become `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1 + 1 = 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is at least 2**
