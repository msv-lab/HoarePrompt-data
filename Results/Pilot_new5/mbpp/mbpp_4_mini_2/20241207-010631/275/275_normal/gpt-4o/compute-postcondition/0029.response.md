According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list. The variable `i` is currently equal to the length of `nums`, which means that the loop has already executed for every index from 0 to `i-1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 

However, since `i` is already equal to `len(nums)`, there are no more indices to process, and the loop cannot iterate again. 

Therefore, to clarify the state for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `len(nums) + 1`, and since `dp` updates don't change based on this particular loop execution, we don't have any further changes to the other variables.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` + 1, and `dp[i-1]` is at least 1.**
