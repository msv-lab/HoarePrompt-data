According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has just started. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is initially 0, the next value for `j` will be 1. 

The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. Given that `i` is greater than 0, it can execute again for `j` equal to 1, and `nums[j]` will be `nums[1]`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements (so that `j` can be 1) and that `j` has been updated to 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1.**
