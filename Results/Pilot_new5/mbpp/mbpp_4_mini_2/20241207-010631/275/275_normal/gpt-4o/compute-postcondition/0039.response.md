Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, and `i` is 3. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[3]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[3]` remains unchanged.***
