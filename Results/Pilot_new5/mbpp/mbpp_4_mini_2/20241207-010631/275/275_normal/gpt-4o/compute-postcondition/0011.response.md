The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the current values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. Given that `dp[j]` is at least 1, `dp[j] + 1` will be at least 2, which means `dp[i]` could be updated to either its current value or one more than `dp[j]`. The state of other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, `j` is set to 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)**.
