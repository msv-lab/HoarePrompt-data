According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i-1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is updated based on whether `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `j` is currently at `i-1`. 

Since `j` starts at `0` and goes up to `i-1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `i`. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be equal to `i`, and since the loop body is omitted, we do not need to modify `dp` or `nums`, but we should ensure that the conditions for executing the loop again are valid.

To summarize, `i` must be incremented to reflect the next iteration, and `j` will start from `0` up to `i-1`. As such, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `2`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is at least 1, `i` must be at least 2, and `j` is set to 0.**
