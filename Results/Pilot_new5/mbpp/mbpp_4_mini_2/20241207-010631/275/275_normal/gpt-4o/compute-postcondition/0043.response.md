The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. If certain conditions are met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence represented by the values in the list 'dp'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either 0 or the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence based on the evaluations performed within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums and returns 0 under certain conditions; otherwise, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence represented by the values in the list 'dp'.**
