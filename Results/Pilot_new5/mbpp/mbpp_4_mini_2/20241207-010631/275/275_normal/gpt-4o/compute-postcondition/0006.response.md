According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0, as the `range(i)` generates a sequence from 0 up to (but not including) `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. The values of `nums` and `dp` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they must remain consistent with their initial definitions.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 and the length is equal to that of `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
