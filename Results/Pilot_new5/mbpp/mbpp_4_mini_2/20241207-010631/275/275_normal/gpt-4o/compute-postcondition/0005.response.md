According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. The loop will execute for each index from 0 to the length of `nums` minus 1. If `nums` is non-empty, then the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0, which is the first index.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, the conditions are:
1. `nums` must be a sorted list of integers and must not be empty (i.e., its length must be greater than 0).
2. `i` is initialized to 0 before the first iteration starts.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 and the length is equal to that of `nums`, `i` is 0**
