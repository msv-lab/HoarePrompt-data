Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the length of the longest divisible subsequence that ends with `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any preceding `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains 1, indicating that the longest divisible subsequence consisting only of `nums[i]` has length 1.**
