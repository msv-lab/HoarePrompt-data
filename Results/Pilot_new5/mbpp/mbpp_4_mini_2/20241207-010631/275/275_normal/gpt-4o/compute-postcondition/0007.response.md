Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 and the length is equal to that of `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (i.e., the remainder when `nums[i]` is divided by `nums[j]` equals 0).***
