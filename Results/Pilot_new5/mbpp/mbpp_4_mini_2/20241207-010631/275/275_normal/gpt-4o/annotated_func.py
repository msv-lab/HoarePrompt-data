#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence ending at that index, `dp` will contain the lengths for all indices based on the relationships defined by divisibility among the elements of `nums`. If `nums` is empty, then `dp` will also be an empty list.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence represented by the values in the list 'dp'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If the list is not empty, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence from the sorted list of integers. This is accomplished by building a dynamic programming list `dp` that tracks the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each element based on its divisibility with preceding elements.
