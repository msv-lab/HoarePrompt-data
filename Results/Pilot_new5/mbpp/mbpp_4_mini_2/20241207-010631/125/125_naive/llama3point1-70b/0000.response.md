To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n`, splitting the list for every `nth` element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Output**: The program uses a list comprehension to create sublists of `lst`. For each index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, it slices the list starting from index `i` and stepping by `n`. 

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is `0`, this would raise an index error since slicing by `0` is invalid.
   - If `lst` is an empty list, the expected output should be an empty list regardless of `n`.
   - If `n` is greater than the length of the list, this would still work fine, but the number of resulting sublists would depend on the value of `n`.
   - If `n` is `1`, the result should be a list containing the original list as it should split the list into parts of size `1`.

### Potential Issue
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is `0`, which would result in an error.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `lst` is empty, but it will likely return an empty list which could be seen as acceptable behavior.

### Conclusion
Given that the function can raise an error when `n` is `0`, we find that there exists at least one input case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
