The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, where `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `lst`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` distributed cyclically based on their original order. If `lst` contains fewer than `n` elements, the behavior is undefined as per the given code, since it assumes that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. However, the code will correctly distribute the elements if `n` is valid.
