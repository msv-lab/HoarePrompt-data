In the given initial state, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element in `lst`. The code snippet `result[i % n].append(element)` modifies the `result` list at the index `i % n`, appending the `element` to that sublist.

Since `i` is 1, we compute `i % n`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state but is expected to be the length of `lst`, we will assume that `n` is equal to `len(lst)`, which is at least 2.

The operation `result[i % n].append(element)` will append the `element` (which is the second item in `lst`) to the sublist located at index `1 % n`. Given `n` is at least 2, `1 % n` will equal `1`. This means that `element` will be appended to `result[1]`.

The execution of the code affects the `result` variable by appending `element` to `result[1]`, while `lst`, `i`, and `element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must contain at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, and `element` has been appended to `result[1]`.**
