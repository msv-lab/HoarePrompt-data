The provided program, `func_1`, is designed to take a list and an integer `n`, and then split the list into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list distributed cyclically. 

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is required to take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list into `n` sublists based on each nth element. This is exactly what the function does by creating `n` empty sublists and iterating through the original list, appending elements to the appropriate sublist based on their index.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The line `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes a list of `n` empty sublists.
   - The for loop `for (i, element) in enumerate(lst)` iterates over each element in the input list along with its index.
   - The expression `result[i % n].append(element)` ensures that elements are added to sublists cyclically. For example:
     - If `n = 3`, the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... get placed in `result[0]`, those at 1, 4, 7, ... in `result[1]`, and those at 2, 5, 8, ... in `result[2]`.

3. **Correctness Check Against Examples**:
   - The provided assertions match the expected output from the problem description:
     - For `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n=3`, the output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]` which is correct.
     - For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]` with `n=3`, the output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]` which is also correct.
     - For `['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL']` with `n=2`, the output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]` which matches the expectation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `n <= len(lst)`, as stated in the comments. Therefore, it should work correctly for any list as long as these conditions are met.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It efficiently distributes the elements of the input list into `n` sublists based on their indices.

Correctness: **True**
