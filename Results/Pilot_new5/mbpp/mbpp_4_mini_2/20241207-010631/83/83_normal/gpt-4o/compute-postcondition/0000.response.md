The variable `max_index` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of `arr`, which remain unchanged. The output state reflects this change while retaining the existing information about `n` and `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0.**
