You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements of any type, `n` is the length of `arr` which is greater than 1. The loop ensures that the maximum elements are moved to their correct positions in descending order for all elements in `arr`.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' in descending order, which contains elements of any type and has a length greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing elements of any type with a length greater than 1 and sorts the list in descending order. It returns the sorted list. However, it does not handle cases where the input list has a length of 1 or is empty, which may lead to incorrect behavior or errors in those situations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer that represents the index of the last element in the list arr, and start is implicitly initialized to 0 which is less than or equal to end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end` plus 1, `end` is less than or equal to the original value of `end` but has been decremented to -1, `arr` has been modified such that the elements between the original indices `0` to `end` have been swapped with their corresponding elements from `end` to `0` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` representing the index of the last element in the list `arr`, and it reverses the elements of `arr` from index `0` to `end`. This function assumes that `arr` is defined globally; if `end` is less than `0`, the function will not perform any operations, effectively resulting in no changes to `arr`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr`, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, and if `n` is 1, `max_index` is 0.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum value in 'arr', which is 'max_index'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max_index` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of an external list `arr` and returns the index of the maximum value in `arr`. However, it assumes that `arr` is defined in the broader scope, which could lead to a NameError if `arr` is not accessible. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the function does not handle this edge case, which could also result in an IndexError when trying to access elements of `arr`. The function does not explicitly handle scenarios where `arr` has only one element or if all elements are equal.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
