Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, then the elements from the start of `arr` up to `max_index` are reversed.***
