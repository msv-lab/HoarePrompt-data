The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. Given that `size` is 1, this means only the first element of `arr` will be reversed, but since reversing a single element does not change its position, `arr[0]` remains unchanged. Since `max_index` is 0, the condition regarding its value does not affect the `arr`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `arr[0]` remains unchanged while retaining the other conditions.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `size` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_index` is 0, and `arr[0]` remains unchanged.**
