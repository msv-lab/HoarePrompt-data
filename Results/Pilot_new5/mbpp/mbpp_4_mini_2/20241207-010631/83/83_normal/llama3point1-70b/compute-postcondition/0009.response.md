According to the code, the loop iterates with `size` starting from `n` and decreasing to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be greater than 1 after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is currently `n`, and since `n` is greater than 0, in the next iteration, `size` will be decreased by 1. 

Therefore, if `size` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, it will be `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be greater than 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, `n - 1` will also be greater than 0. 

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
