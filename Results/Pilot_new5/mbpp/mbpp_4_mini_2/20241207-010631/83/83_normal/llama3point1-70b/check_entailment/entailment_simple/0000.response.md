Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements a sorting algorithm for a list of comparable elements as described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `arr`, which is expected to be a list of elements.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program employs a sorting mechanism that repeatedly finds the maximum element of the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the end. This is done by:
   - Iterating from the end of the list to the beginning (`for size in range(n, 0, -1)`).
   - Finding the index of the maximum element within the unsorted portion of the list.
   - If the maximum element is not already in its proper position (the end of the unsorted section), it reverses the sublist containing the maximum element and then reverses the entire unsorted portion to place the maximum correctly.
  
3. **Correct Output**: After the loop has executed, the list `arr` is sorted in ascending order. The program returns the sorted list, which fulfills the requirement of sorting the list of elements.

4. **Generality**: The sorting mechanism works for any list of elements that can be compared to one another, and it handles various cases, such as lists with duplicate elements or lists that are already sorted.

Since the program accurately performs the task of sorting a list, it satisfies the problem description.
