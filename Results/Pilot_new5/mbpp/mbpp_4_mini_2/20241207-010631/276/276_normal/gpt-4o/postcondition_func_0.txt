The function accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing the size of the lists. It returns the median of the sorted combination of these two lists. If the merged list is of even length, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle values; if it is of odd length, it returns the middle value. The function does not perform any checks for the input validity, meaning it assumes that both lists are non-empty and of the same length as specified by `n`.
