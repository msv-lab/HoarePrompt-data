The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, and `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (with n > 0). After executing the function body, it calculates the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If the size of the combined list (denoted as `merged_list`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle values; if the size of `merged_list` is odd, it returns the middle value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists of integers and their size, and return the median of the sorted combination of these lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers and a positive integer representing their size, returns the median of the sorted combination of the two lists.**
