To assess the correctness of the given Python program, we start by examining the problem description and the code itself.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

The code merges two lists, sorts them, and then calculates the median based on whether the number of elements in the merged list is even or odd.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Merging and Sorting:** The merge operation is correctly handled since it combines `list1` and `list2` and then sorts the resulting list. 
2. **Finding the Median:** 
   - If the length of the merged list is even, it correctly computes the median as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the length is odd, it returns the middle element.

### Edge Cases:
While the code seems correct in theory, we must consider a few potential edge cases:
1. **Input Validation:** The problem description does not explicitly mention whether the inputs will always be valid (i.e., non-empty lists of equal length). The function does not check for invalid inputs, which could lead to errors if an assumption fails (e.g., if the lists are empty or of different lengths).
2. **Exact Input Size:** The function assumes `n` is correct, but if `n` does not match the actual lengths of `list1` and `list2`, it could lead to incorrect behavior, even though the assertion checks in the program do help in these cases.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer `n` representing the size of the lists.
- It returns the median of the sorted combination of these two lists.
- It correctly handles even and odd lengths.
- It does not perform any checks for input validity.

The output hints align with the function's operation. However, they also highlight the lack of input validation, which is a critical oversight.

### Conclusion:
Given that:
- The program does not handle scenarios where the input does not meet the expected criteria (e.g., empty lists, unequal lengths).
- The output hints correctly state that the function does not perform any checks for input validity, thereby confirming the concern regarding potential edge cases.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the lack of input validation.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The code does not validate input sizes or handle the case where input lists may be empty or of different sizes. Thus, it may fail for those inputs, and since it doesn't follow the problem description for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
