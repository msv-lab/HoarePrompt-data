The variable `median` is assigned the value calculated as the average of the two middle elements of `merged_list`, specifically the elements at positions `mid - 1` and `mid`. Since `merged_list` has an even length, `mid` can be defined as `len(merged_list) // 2`. The values of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` will be the two middle integers of the sorted `merged_list`.

The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `n`, and `merged_list`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `median`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (n > 0), `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and the length of `merged_list` is an even number; `median` is calculated as (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2.**
