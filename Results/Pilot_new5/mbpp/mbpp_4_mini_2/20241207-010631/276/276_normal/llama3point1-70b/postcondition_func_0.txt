The function accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer (`size`), representing the length of the lists. It merges the two lists, sorts them, and calculates the median value. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values; if odd, it is the middle value in the sorted merged list. The function does not handle cases where `size` does not accurately reflect the length of `list1` and `list2`, nor does it check if the lists are empty, which could lead to an index error.
