The code merges `list1` and `list2`, then sorts the resulting list and assigns it to `merged_list`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size and size is a positive integer, the `merged_list` will be a sorted list containing all elements from both lists.

The state of `list1` and `list2` remains unchanged, while `merged_list` is a new list that contains all integers from both lists in sorted order.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`.**
