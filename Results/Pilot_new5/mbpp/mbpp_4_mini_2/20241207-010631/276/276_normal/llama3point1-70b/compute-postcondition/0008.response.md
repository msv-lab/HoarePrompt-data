The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and `size` is a positive integer representing the length of the lists, which must be the same for both lists. After executing the function body, it returns the median value of the combined lists `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle value at the index corresponding to `middle_index` in the sorted merged list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers and their size, and return the median value of the combined lists based on the size being even or odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers and their size, returning the median value of the combined lists based on whether the size is even or odd.**
