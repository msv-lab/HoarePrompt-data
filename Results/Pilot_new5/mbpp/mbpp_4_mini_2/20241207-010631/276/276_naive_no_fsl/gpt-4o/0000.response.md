Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a breakdown of why the code meets the problem description:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists as input, combines them, and sorts the merged list. The use of `sorted(list1 + list2)` ensures that the combined list is correctly sorted, which is essential for calculating the median.

2. **Finding the Median**: The function correctly calculates the median based on the length of the merged list:
   - If the length is even, it correctly averages the two middle numbers.
   - If the length is odd, it selects the middle number directly.

3. **Testing with Assertions**: The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases. The function returns the expected median values, confirming that it behaves as intended for those examples.

Overall, the logic is sound, and I cannot identify any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
