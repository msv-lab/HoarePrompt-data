The code assigns the value `0` to `low` and the value `len(arr) - 1` to `high`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `len(arr)` will give a non-negative integer representing the length of the list. Thus, `high` will be the index of the last element in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `0`, and `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, and `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1.**
