Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers and `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is set to `mid` and `mid` is calculated as (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is recalculated. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `low` remains 0, `result` is -1, and `mid` is recalculated, ensuring that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`.***
