The code updates the value of `high` by assigning it the value of `mid - 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `mid` is equal to `(0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2`, and therefore `high` will now be `mid - 1`. The state of `low`, `result`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is mid - 1, `result` is -1, `mid` is equal to (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, and `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to target.**
