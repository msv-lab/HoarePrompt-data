You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`, or -1 if `target` does not exist in `arr`. If `target` is greater than the largest element in `arr`, then `low` will have become `len(arr)`, and `high` will be less than `len(arr) - 1`. If `target` is less than the smallest element in `arr`, then `low` will still be 0 and `high` will be -1 indicating that `target` is not present. If `target` is found, `result` will hold the index of its last occurrence.
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`, or -1 if `target` does not exist in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists; otherwise, it returns -1 if `target` does not exist in `arr`. The function correctly handles cases where `target` is less than the smallest element or greater than the largest element in `arr`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
