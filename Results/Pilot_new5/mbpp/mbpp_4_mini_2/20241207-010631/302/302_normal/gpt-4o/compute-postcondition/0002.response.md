According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least one time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, which is true in this case since `low` is 0 and `high` is the last index of the array. No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, result is -1**
