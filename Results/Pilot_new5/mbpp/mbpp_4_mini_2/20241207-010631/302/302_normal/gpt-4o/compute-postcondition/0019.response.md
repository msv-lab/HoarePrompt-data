The variable `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` will be set to one less than the current value of `mid`. The preconditions regarding `arr`, `target`, `low`, and the relationship between `low` and `high` remain valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, high is updated to mid - 1.**
