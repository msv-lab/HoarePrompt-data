The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`, which means `mid` is less than or equal to `high` and greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, the new value of `low` will be greater than `mid` and still less than or equal to `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is greater than `mid` and less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
