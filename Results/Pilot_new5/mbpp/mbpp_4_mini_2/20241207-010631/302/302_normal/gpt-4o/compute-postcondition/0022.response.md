According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which means the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed. Therefore, the variables in the state do not require any changes. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`**.
