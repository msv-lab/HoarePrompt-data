The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state will include the updated value of `mid`, while retaining the information about `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
