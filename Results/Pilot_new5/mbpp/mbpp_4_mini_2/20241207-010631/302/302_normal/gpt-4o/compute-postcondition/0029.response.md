Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to be greater than `mid` while remaining less than or equal to `high`, with `mid` recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` remains less than or equal to `high` while `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.***
