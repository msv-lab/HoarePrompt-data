To analyze the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, we need to consider how the loop behaves based on its code and the initial conditions.

The loop iterates over the sorted list `arr` and checks each element against the integer `num`. If a match is found, the index `i` of that element is returned. If no match is found by the time the loop completes all iterations, the function would return `None`.

Now, if the loop executes for all iterations, it means that all elements in the array were checked without finding a match for `num`. Therefore, after all iterations:

1. The index `i` would equal the length of the array, which indicates that the loop has checked every item.
2. The variable `x` would not equal `num`, as no item matched `num` during the iterations.
3. The list `arr` remains unchanged, as it was not modified during the loop's execution.

Given that the loop checks all elements in `arr`, the output state will summarize the conditions after all iterations:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the length of `arr`, `x` is the value of the last integer in `arr`, and `num` is not present in `arr`.**
