According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last element, and `x` is the last integer in the list. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 integer, and initially, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first integer in the list. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer in the list**
