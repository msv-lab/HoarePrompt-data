Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` if found. If `num` is not present in `arr`, it returns -1. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, but it will correctly return -1 in such instances, indicating that `num` is not found.**
