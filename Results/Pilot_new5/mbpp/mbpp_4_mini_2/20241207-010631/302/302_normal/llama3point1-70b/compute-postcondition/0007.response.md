According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as it has elements in the `arr` list. The loop uses `enumerate(arr)`, which means it will iterate through each element of the `arr`, providing both the index `i` and the value `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, indicating that the loop has processed the first element of `arr`, and `x` is the second integer in the list. Since `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must be updated to the third integer in the list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2, and `x` should be the third integer in `arr`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third integer in the list.**
