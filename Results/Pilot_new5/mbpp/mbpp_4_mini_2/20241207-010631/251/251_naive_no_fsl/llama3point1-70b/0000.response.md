Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). 

1. **Calculation of r**: The program uses `math.hypot(x, y)` which accurately calculates the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This is correct for all possible values of x and y.

2. **Calculation of phi**: The program uses `math.atan2(y, x)` which correctly computes the angle phi in radians. This function takes into account the signs of both x and y, thus providing the correct quadrant for the angle. This is particularly important for cases where x or y is negative, or both.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When both x and y are zero (0, 0), the function will return (0, 0) which is a valid polar representation (at the origin).
   - When x is positive and y is zero (e.g., (1, 0)), it correctly returns (1.0, 0.0).
   - When y is positive and x is zero (e.g., (0, 1)), it correctly returns (1.0, π/2).
   - When x is negative and y is zero (e.g., (-1, 0)), the result will be (1.0, π).
   - When y is negative and x is zero (e.g., (0, -1)), it correctly returns (1.0, -π/2).
   - The function correctly handles all quadrants based on the signs of x and y.

Given these considerations, the function fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description for all possible inputs.
