The problem description requires a function to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). The code provided calculates the polar coordinates correctly using the formulas:

- \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for the distance from the origin.
- \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \) for the angle in radians from the positive x-axis.

Upon reviewing the edge cases, I can see that the function correctly handles various scenarios:
1. It uses the `math.atan2` function, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases where the coordinates might lie on the axes (e.g., when x = 0).
2. The calculation of r (the radius) will always yield a non-negative result, as it is derived from the square root of the sum of squares.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts two floating-point numbers and returns the expected polar coordinates, which aligns with the requirements.

I do not see any examples or cases where the function would fail according to the problem description. The assertions provided in the code serve as tests that validate the conversion for specific coordinate pairs, and they all appear to be correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the polar coordinates for given rectangular coordinates according to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases effectively.
