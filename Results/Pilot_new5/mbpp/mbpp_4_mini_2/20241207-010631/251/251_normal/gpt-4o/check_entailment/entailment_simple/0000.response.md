Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. 

2. **Calculation of `r`**: The calculation of `r` (the radius) is done using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This is the standard formula to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, representing the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).

3. **Calculation of `θ`**: The angle `θ` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This is the correct approach to determine the angle in polar coordinates.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing `r` and `θ`, which is the expected output format.

5. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that check the output of the function against known values, which further validates that the function produces the correct results for the specified test cases.

Given all these points, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Therefore, it is correct.
