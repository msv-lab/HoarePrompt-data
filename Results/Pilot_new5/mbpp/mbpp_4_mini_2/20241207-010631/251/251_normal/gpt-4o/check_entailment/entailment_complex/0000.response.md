Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Rectangular to Polar Conversion**: The function `func_1` uses the formulas:
   - \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \): This correctly calculates the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is the definition of the polar coordinate `r`.
   - \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \): This correctly computes the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). The use of `math.atan2` is appropriate as it takes into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

2. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem statement.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code test the function with specific examples of rectangular coordinates and their expected corresponding polar coordinates, demonstrating that the function behaves as intended.

Since both the distance and angle are computed accurately and returned in the correct format, the program fulfills the problem requirements effectively for all potential cases.
