The variable `r` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of `x` squared and `y` squared, which is calculated using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). The values of `x` and `y` are not changed by this operation, and they still represent the rectangular coordinates.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the square root of `x**2 + y**2`.**
