`r` is assigned the value of `math.hypot(x, y)`, which calculates the Euclidean norm (or distance from the origin) given the rectangular coordinates `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers, `r` will be a floating-point number representing the distance from the point `(x, y)` to the origin `(0, 0)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and `r` is a positive floating-point number equal to the distance from the origin, calculated as `math.hypot(x, y)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is a positive floating-point number equal to `math.hypot(x, y)`.**
