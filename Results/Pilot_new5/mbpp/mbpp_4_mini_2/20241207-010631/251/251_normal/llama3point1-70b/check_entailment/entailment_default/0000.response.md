The provided program is designed to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). 

Analyzing the code:
```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)
```
1. The function calculates `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the hypotenuse or the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). This part of the code correctly implements the calculation as per the problem description.
2. The angle `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly computes the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y).

Next, examining the edge cases:
- If both `x = 0` and `y = 0`, `math.hypot(0, 0)` will return `0` (which is correct), but `math.atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. In this scenario, the function should not return a valid angle as it does not represent a point in the polar coordinate system.

Now, looking at the output hints:
- The hints correctly describe the function's input and the calculations involved. They also point out that the function does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, leading to an undefined angle. This aligns with the analysis of edge cases.

Given that the function does not account for the case where both coordinates are zero, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero, which would result in an undefined angle for `phi`.
