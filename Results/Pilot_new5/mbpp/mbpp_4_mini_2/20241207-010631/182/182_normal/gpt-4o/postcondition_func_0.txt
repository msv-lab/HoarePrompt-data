The function accepts a tuple `tup` of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an IndexError because it tries to access the last character of an empty string. Therefore, the function does not handle the case where the strings in the tuple may be empty.
