Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `strings`, and for each string, it accesses the last character using the index `-1`. 

This matches the requirement to "extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple." The last character of each string is correctly extracted and compiled into a list, which is then returned.

The function handles any tuple of strings, including cases where strings may be empty (which would raise an IndexError), but the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases. However, assuming that all strings in the tuple are non-empty, the function will always perform as expected. 

Thus, the program meets the criteria laid out in the problem description.
