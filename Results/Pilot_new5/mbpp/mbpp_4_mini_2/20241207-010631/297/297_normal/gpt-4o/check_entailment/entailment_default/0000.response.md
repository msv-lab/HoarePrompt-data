The provided program aims to take a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. According to the problem description, for an input tuple of length \( N + 1 \), the output should be a tuple of length \( N \) containing the products \( t_i \times t_{i+1} \).

Let's analyze the program and consider any edge cases:

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```
- The function uses a generator expression to compute the product of adjacent elements in the tuple `t`.
- The range `len(t) - 1` ensures that it doesn't go out of bounds when accessing `t[i + 1]`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Length Requirement**: The problem states that the input tuple will always have at least two elements. This assertion is confirmed by the provided test cases, which include tuples with more than one element, and the output hints also indicate that the function will behave as expected for valid inputs.
2. **Zero or Negative Values**: The problem description does not specify what should happen with negative numbers or zeros. However, since it involves multiplication, the function will return valid outputs even if the inputs are negative or zero. This does not invalidate the logic, but if there were any specific requirements on the input values, it would need to be considered.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints indicate:
- The function accepts a tuple `t` with at least two numerical elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of adjacent elements in `t`. 
- It states that the function may not behave as expected for fewer than two elements, but it reinforces that valid usage will always have at least two elements.

### Consensus on Correctness
The provided program accurately calculates the products of adjacent elements as required by the problem description. The test cases also confirm that the function performs correctly for tuples of various lengths and compositions.

Thus, I could not find any edge cases or discrepancies between the code and the problem description that would invalidate its correctness.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly implements the logic of multiplying consecutive elements in the tuple and aligns with the problem description. The output hints support this conclusion, confirming that the function is designed to handle the specified input appropriately.
