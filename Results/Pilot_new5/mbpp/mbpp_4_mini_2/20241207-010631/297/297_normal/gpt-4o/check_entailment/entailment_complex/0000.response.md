Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(t)` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**: The function needs to take a tuple `t` with elements \( (t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{N+1}) \) and return a new tuple of length \( N \) where the \( i \)-th element is calculated as \( t_i \times t_{i+1} \). This means it computes the product of each pair of adjacent elements in the input tuple.

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` is implemented as follows:
   ```python
   def func_1(t):
       return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
   ```
   - The function uses a generator expression that iterates over the indices from `0` to `len(t) - 2` (which is effectively \( N \) iterations for \( N+1 \) elements).
   - For each index `i`, it computes the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]`, which aligns perfectly with the requirement of multiplying adjacent elements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The assert statements indicate that the function is expected to handle tuples of at least two elements (as stated in the annotations). The program adheres to this precondition, and since it is designed to return a tuple of products for all valid inputs as per the problem description, it fulfills the requirement.

4. **Output Validation**: The examples provided in the assertions validate that the function produces the expected results:
   - For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which corresponds to \( 1 \times 5, 5 \times 7, 7 \times 8, \) and \( 8 \times 10 \).
   - The other examples similarly produce the expected outputs confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Since the function correctly computes the desired products of adjacent elements and adheres to the specified input conditions, we conclude that it meets the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the function is validated as true.
