Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple contains fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, if the input tuple has only one element (like `(12,)`), the expected output should be an empty tuple `()`. However, the assertion for `func_1((12,))` comes before the function definition, which will result in an error when the assertion is executed because `func_1` will not be defined yet. Additionally, the program does not account for error handling, such as when no elements are provided in the tuple. 

A problematic case is when the input is an empty tuple `()`. The function should return an empty tuple, but it will not execute correctly without proper handling or when the assertions are evaluated before the function definition.
