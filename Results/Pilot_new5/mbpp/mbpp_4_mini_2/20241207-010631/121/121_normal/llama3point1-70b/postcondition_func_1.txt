The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 0 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it specifically returns 7. For other values of `n`, it calculates subsequent prime numbers starting from 7, checking the conditions defined in `func_1`, and returns the nth prime number that is congruent to either 1 or 5 modulo 6. This function does not directly return 8 or 9, as implied in the annotations, but rather potentially any prime number satisfying the given conditions.
