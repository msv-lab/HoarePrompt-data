To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task requires writing a function that finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function is correctly implemented to check if a number `n` is prime.
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks for factors from 2 to the square root of `n`. If no factors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This ensures that only prime numbers are identified correctly.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - It correctly handles the case when `n` equals 1 by returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - It initializes a count and begins with the number 7. The loop continues indefinitely until it finds the nth prime.
   - It checks each number to see if it is prime (using `func_1(num)`) and also checks if `num % 6` equals 1 or 5, which are conditions that help identify primes in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
   - The count is incremented for each valid prime found, and once the count matches `n`, it returns the corresponding prime.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as per the problem description.
- It properly identifies primes using `func_1` and applies the necessary conditions to determine the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
