According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
