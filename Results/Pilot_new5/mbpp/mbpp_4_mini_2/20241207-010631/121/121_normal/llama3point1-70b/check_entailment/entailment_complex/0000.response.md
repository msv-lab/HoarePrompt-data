Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `n` is greater than 1 properly. Specifically, if `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function `func_2` is supposed to return the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, starting from 7. However, the logic within the while loop does not account for all potential prime numbers correctly and may skip valid candidates.

For instance, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc. If `n = 2`, then `func_2` should return 11. The logic currently in the loop only increments the `count` when a number is both prime (using `func_1`) and congruent to either 1 or 5 modulo 6. 

If we take `n = 2`, `func_1` will find the prime numbers greater than 7, but it may overlook valid primes that do not fulfill the condition of being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. For example, the code may skip over 11, which should be the second prime in the sequence but might be missed due to the modulo condition.

Therefore, since the function does not reliably return the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for all values of `n`, it does not meet the problem description's requirements.
