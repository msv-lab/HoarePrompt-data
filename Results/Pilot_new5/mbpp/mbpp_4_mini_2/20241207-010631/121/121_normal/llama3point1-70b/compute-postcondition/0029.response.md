The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `num` is 9, after the execution of the code, `num` becomes 10. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is 10.**
