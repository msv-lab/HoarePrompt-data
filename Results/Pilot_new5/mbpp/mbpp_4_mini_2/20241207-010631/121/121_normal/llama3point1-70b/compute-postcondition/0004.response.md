The value of `count` is assigned the value `1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Since `n` is specified as a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, this condition still holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1**.
