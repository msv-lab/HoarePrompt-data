Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. 

The function `func_1` implements a calculation based on a recurrence relation, specifically `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which generates a sequence; however, it does not refer to or correctly compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers defined by a different mathematical formulation. 

The assertions provided at the beginning of the code (`assert func_1(3) == 7`, etc.) suggest that the expected outputs correspond to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th values in this specific prime sequence, but the logic in `func_1` does not actually compute these primes. 

For example, the program returns 1 for inputs 0 and 1, which is not part of the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, and it does not correctly calculate the primes for larger values of `n`.

In conclusion, the function does not meet the problem description's requirement to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
