According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n+1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as 3 and `n` as a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

After the current iteration, `i` will become 4. Since `n` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 (to satisfy the condition `i <= n`).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
