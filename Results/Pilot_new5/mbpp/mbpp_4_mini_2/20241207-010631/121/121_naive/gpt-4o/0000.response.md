Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but it does not correctly implement this logic. The assertions in the program test values that are not relevant to the function's implementation. Specifically, the function only computes a sequence based on the recurrence relation \( S(n) = 2 \cdot S(n-1) + S(n-2) \), which is not the correct method to calculate the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

For example:
- The function `func_1(3)` should return the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is 7 according to the sequence, but the implementation does not correctly identify or return prime numbers. 

Thus, there are multiple cases where the function does not work as expected, confirming that the program is incorrect.
