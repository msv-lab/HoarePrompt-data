The code assigns a list of months that have 31 days to the variable `months_31_days`. The variable `n`, which represents the month number, remains unchanged. The output state reflects that the variable `months_31_days` now contains a specific list of integers, while all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the month number, where 1 <= n <= 12; `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
