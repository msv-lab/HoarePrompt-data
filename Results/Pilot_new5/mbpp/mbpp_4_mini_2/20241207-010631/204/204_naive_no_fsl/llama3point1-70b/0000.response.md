Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days. It defines a list `months_31_days` which includes the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function checks if the input month number `n` is present in this list.

Since the problem description is to check whether the given month number contains 31 days, the function fulfills this requirement for all valid month numbers (1 through 12). The edge cases, such as invalid month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13) are not explicitly handled by the program; however, since the problem description does not specify behavior for invalid inputs, this is acceptable. 

Thus, for all valid inputs (1 to 12), the function will return `True` for month numbers that have 31 days and `False` otherwise, ensuring it behaves as described.
