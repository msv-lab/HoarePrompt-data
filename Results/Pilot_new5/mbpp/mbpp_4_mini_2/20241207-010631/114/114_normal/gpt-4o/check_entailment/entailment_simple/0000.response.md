Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because the function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and correctly counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method of the tuple. 

Hereâ€™s how it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and an `element`, which can be of any data type. This aligns with the problem description that states the function should take in a tuple and an element.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses `tup.count(element)` to count how many times the specified `element` appears in the `tup`. This directly satisfies the requirement of counting occurrences as specified in the problem description.

3. **Functionality**: The assertions provided in the annotated program check the function's output against expected results for various inputs. They confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning the correct count of occurrences for the tested elements.

Since the function fulfills all aspects of the problem description for any potential case, we conclude that the program is correct.
