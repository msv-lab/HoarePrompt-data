The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type, while `element` can also be of any data type. After executing the function body, it returns the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and return the number of occurrences of that `element` within the `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`.**
