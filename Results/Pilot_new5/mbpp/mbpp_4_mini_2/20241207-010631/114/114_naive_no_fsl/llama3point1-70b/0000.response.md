Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(tup, elem)` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and uses the built-in `count` method of the tuple to count how many times `elem` occurs in `tup`.

The `count` method accurately handles all cases, including:
- When the element is not present in the tuple (returns 0).
- When the element occurs multiple times (returns the correct count).
- When the element is of a different type (e.g., counting a string in a tuple of integers returns 0).
- When the input is an empty tuple (returns 0).

Since the implementation correctly handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Thus, the conclusion is that the implementation is correct.
