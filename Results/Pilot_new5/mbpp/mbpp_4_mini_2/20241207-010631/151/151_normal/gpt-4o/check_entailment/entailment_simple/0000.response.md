Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the task of flattening a given nested list structure, which is in accordance with the problem description. Here's why the function meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle lists that may be nested to any depth. When it encounters an item that is a list, it calls itself (`func_1(item)`) to flatten that sublist, ensuring that all levels of nesting are addressed.

2. **Appending Non-List Items**: For items that are not lists, it appends them directly to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all integers and non-list elements are preserved in the final output.

3. **Combining Results**: The use of `flat_list.extend()` allows the function to accumulate results from both nested lists and non-list items seamlessly, resulting in a single flattened list.

4. **Handling All Cases**: The assertions provided test the function against various scenarios, including lists containing lists of varying depths and straightforward lists. These tests confirm that the function behaves as expected across diverse input structures.

Overall, the function covers all potential cases outlined in the problem description, making it a correct implementation for flattening a nested list structure.
