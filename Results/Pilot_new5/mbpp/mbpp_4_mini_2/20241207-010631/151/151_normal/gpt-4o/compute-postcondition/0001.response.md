According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` contains at least one element (which could be an integer or another list), the loop will execute. Given that `flat_list` is currently empty, it does not influence the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least one item, which will be assigned to `item` in the first iteration.

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
