#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list can be a list that may contain other lists of integers or other nested lists, and it can also include non-list elements.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all the elements from `nested_list`, including elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`, and `nested_list` may contain any combination of lists and non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all elements from nested_list, including elements from nested lists processed by func_1. If nested_list is empty, flat_list remains empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers, nested lists, or other non-list elements. It recursively flattens this list, returning a single list that contains all integers and non-list elements from `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not handle cases where non-list elements are nested within lists; it assumes any non-list element can be added directly to the flattened list.
