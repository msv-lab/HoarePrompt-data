Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle nested lists recursively. When it encounters an element of type `list`, it calls itself to process that nested list, effectively flattening it. The use of `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` ensures that all elements from the nested list are added to the flat list.

2. **Handling Non-List Elements**: For non-list elements, the function simply appends them to `flat_list`. This behavior ensures that all integers and non-list elements are preserved in their original order.

3. **Empty Input**: If the input `nested_list` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list, as stated in the annotations. This is aligned with the expectation that if no elements exist to flatten, the result should also be an empty list.

4. **Order Preservation**: The program maintains the order of elements as they appear in the original nested structure, fulfilling the requirement to preserve order during the flattening process.

5. **General Case Handling**: The function does not restrict the types of non-list elements that can be included. This means it can handle various types of data (assuming they're not lists), which aligns with the problem description's lack of restrictions on the contents of the list.

Overall, the function behaves according to the problem description for all outlined cases, thereby confirming its correctness.
