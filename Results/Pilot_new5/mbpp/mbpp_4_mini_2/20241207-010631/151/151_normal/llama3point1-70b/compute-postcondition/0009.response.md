The variable `flat_list` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is the second element in the `nested_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, so `i` has a valid value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in the list; `flat_list` is extended by appending `i`.**
