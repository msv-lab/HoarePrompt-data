The function `func_1(i)` is called with `i`, which is the first element of `nested_list`, and its return value is extended to `flat_list`. The state of `flat_list` changes as elements from the result of `func_1(i)` are added to it. The values of `nested_list` and `i` remain unchanged; however, `flat_list` now includes the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` which is a list, and `flat_list` now contains its previous elements plus the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` which is a list, and `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(i)`**.
