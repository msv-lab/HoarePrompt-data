The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. If `list1` is non-empty, the function returns `list1` with its last element replaced by `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the function returns `list2`. In both cases, `list2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, and return a modified version of `list1`, or `list2` if `list1` is empty, while ensuring that `list2` does not change. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, and returns `list1` with its last element replaced by `list2` if `list1` is non-empty, or returns `list2` if `list1` is empty.**
