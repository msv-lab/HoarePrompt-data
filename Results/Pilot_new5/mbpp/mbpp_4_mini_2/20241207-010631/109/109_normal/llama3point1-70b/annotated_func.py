#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is non-empty, its last element is replaced by `list2`, while `list2` remains unchanged and `list1` is still a non-empty list. If `list1` is empty, then `list1` becomes equal to `list2`, containing the same elements as `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which will either have its last element replaced by list2 if list1 is non-empty, or it will be equal to list2 if list1 is empty. In both cases, list2 remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. If `list1` is non-empty, it replaces its last element with the contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. In both cases, `list2` remains unchanged. The function ultimately returns the modified `list1`.
