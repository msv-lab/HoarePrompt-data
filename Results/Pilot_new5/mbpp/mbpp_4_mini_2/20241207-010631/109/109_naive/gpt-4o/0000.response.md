Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirement described in the problem statement. The problem description specifies that the function should "replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list." However, the implementation instead removes the last element of `list1` and concatenates `list2` to the end of the modified `list1`.

For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1([1, 3, 5], [10])
```

According to the problem description, we would expect the output to be:

```
[1, 3, 10]
```

However, the actual output of the function would be:

```
[1, 3]
```

This discrepancy shows that the implementation does not fulfill the requirement, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the output must be "False."
