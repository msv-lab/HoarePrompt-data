Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description to "replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list." Instead, it incorrectly removes the last element of the first list and concatenates the second list to the remaining elements of the first list.

For example, if we consider the input `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])`, according to the problem description, we would expect the output to be `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6]` (where the last element `5` is replaced by the elements of the second list). However, the current implementation will produce `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6]` by removing `5` rather than replacing it, which does not fulfill the requirement of the problem. 

Therefore, the function does not handle this case as expected, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
