Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it meets the specifications:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` is defined to take two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The function uses slicing to split the list `lst` into two parts:
   - The first part is obtained by `lst[:L]`, which retrieves the elements from the start of the list up to, but not including, index `L`. This effectively gives a sublist of length `L`.
   - The second part is obtained by `lst[L:]`, which retrieves the remaining elements of the list starting from index `L` to the end.

3. **Return Format**: The function returns a tuple containing the two sublists. This matches the requirement to return the resulting lists in a tuple.

4. **Handling of Input**: The function correctly handles the specified conditions where `L` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This means that it can handle cases where `L` is 0 (returning two empty lists), as well as cases where `L` equals the length of the list (returning the entire list in the first part and an empty second part).

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, confirming that it adheres to the problem requirements. Thus, the implementation is considered correct.
