The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first list will be the entire list and the second list will be empty. If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty and the second list will be the entire list. The function does not enforce any constraints on `L` beyond it being a non-negative integer within the bounds specified.
