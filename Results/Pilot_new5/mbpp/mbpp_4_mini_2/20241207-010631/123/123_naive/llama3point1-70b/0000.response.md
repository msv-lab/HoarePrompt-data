Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the specified length `L` exceeds the length of the list `lst`. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 5`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which does not match the expected behavior in the problem description, as it should ideally handle or signal an error for this situation. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
