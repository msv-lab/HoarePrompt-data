Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the integer L is greater than the length of the list. For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior according to the problem description is to return the first L elements and the remainder of the list. However, since the list only has 3 elements, trying to access `lst[L:]` will not return anything beyond the end of the list, resulting in the output `([], [])` instead of the expected `([1, 2, 3], [])`. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements for all potential cases.
