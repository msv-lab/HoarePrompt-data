Correctness: **True**

The annotated program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to count the number of integer elements in the provided list `lst`. This aligns directly with the problem description that specifies returning the number of integer elements in a given list.

2. **Correct Implementation**: The program uses a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` to iterate through each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if it is an instance of `int`. This effectively counts all the integer elements.

3. **Summation**: The `sum()` function is used to accumulate the counts of `True` values (which represent integers) returned by the generator expression. Since `True` is equivalent to `1` in Python, this correctly computes the total number of integer elements.

4. **Handling Non-integers**: The function does not count non-integer types, which is consistent with the problem requirement to only return the count of integers.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function will return `0` if there are no integers in the list, which is also consistent with the requirement of counting integers.

Overall, the function is correctly implemented to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases, thus the correctness is affirmed as **True**.
