#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain integer elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It does not account for any other types of elements and will simply count all instances of integers present, returning 0 if there are none.
