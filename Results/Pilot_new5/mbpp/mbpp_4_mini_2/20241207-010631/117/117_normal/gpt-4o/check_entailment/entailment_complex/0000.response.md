Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function that counts the number of integer elements in a given list, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` is defined to accept a list of elements named `lst`.

2. **Counting Integers**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each element in the list and applies the `isinstance(x, int)` check to determine if an element is an integer. For each integer found, it sums 1.

3. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns the total count of integer elements. If there are no integers in the list, or if the list is empty, the sum will correctly be 0, adhering to the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided as test cases validate that the function performs as expected for various scenarios, including lists with mixed data types and an empty list.

Overall, the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description, ensuring it counts only integer elements and ignores other data types.
