#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, which may include integers and other data types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst' by summing 1 for each element that is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It ignores all other data types, and if the list is empty, it returns 0, as there are no integers to count.
