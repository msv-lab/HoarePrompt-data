To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

### Program Code
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))
```

### Analysis
1. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to count the number of elements in `lst` that are instances of `int`.
2. The `isinstance(x, int)` check correctly identifies integer types.
3. It correctly counts integers in the provided test cases.

### Test Cases
- For the first assertion `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])`, it correctly counts `1` and `2` as integers, returning `2`.
- For the second assertion `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, it counts `1`, `2`, and `3`, returning `3`.
- For the third assertion `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])`, it counts `1` and `4` as integers, returning `2`.

### Missing Edge Cases
However, let's consider potential edge cases that the program might not handle:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return `0`, which the program will handle correctly as no integers are present.
- **Non-Integer Numeric Types**: Inputs like `[1, 2.0, 3.0, '4']` should return `2` because `2.0` and `3.0` are not integers (`isinstance` will return `False` for these).
- **Negative Integers**: If we use an input like `[1, -1, 'abc']`, it correctly counts `1` and `-1` returning `2`.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the function, it appears to handle various cases as expected by the problem description and does not have any logic errors.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list for all tested cases, including empty lists, lists with negative integers, and lists with mixed types.
