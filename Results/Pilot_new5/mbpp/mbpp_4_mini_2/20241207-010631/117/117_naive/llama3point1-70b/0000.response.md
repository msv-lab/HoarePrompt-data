Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the provided list. It uses a generator expression to check if each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of `int`, and then sums up the results (True counts as 1 and False as 0). This approach handles various cases, including empty lists, lists containing non-integer types, and lists with mixed data types. For instance:

- An empty list `[]` will return `0`.
- A list like `[1, 2, 'three', 4.0]` will correctly return `2`.
- A list with only integers, like `[1, 2, 3]`, will return `3`.

Since the code accurately fulfills the problem description for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
