Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. In such a case, it would return `(0, [])`, which is not consistent with the expectation of finding a list of maximum length. The problem description does not specify the expected behavior for an empty input, but returning a maximum length of `0` with an empty list as the second element could be interpreted as incorrect because there are no lists to compare. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would return `(0, [])`, which is not a valid output based on the provided assertions, as the assertions assume there are valid lists to evaluate. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
