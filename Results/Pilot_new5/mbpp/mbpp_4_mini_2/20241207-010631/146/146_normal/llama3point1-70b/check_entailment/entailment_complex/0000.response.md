Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Return Values**: The problem description asks for a function that finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the program returns two values: the maximum length (`max_len`) and the first sublist from `max_sublists` that has that maximum length. The correct behavior according to the problem description should only return the list(s) of maximum length, not the maximum length itself.

2. **Handling of Empty Input**: If the input `list_of_lists` is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` because it attempts to calculate the maximum length of an empty list with `max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`. The problem description does not mention handling such cases, which indicates that the function should gracefully handle an empty input or return an appropriate value.

In summary, the program fails to strictly adhere to the problem description by returning unwanted additional information (the maximum length) and not handling the case of an empty list properly.
