The variable `max_sublists` is assigned a list comprehension that filters `list_of_lists`, including only those sublists where the length of the sublist equals `max_len`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the new value of `max_sublists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of any type; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list of sublists where each sublist has a length equal to `max_len`.**
