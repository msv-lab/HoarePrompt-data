The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying length. After executing the function body, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. If `list_of_lists` is not empty, it returns `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, which is the longest sublist itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself, while handling the case of an empty input list appropriately.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself, returning 0 and an empty list if list_of_lists is empty.**
