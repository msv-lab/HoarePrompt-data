The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The condition related to `max_len` is not directly altered by this line of code. The other variables maintain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` remains unchanged, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
