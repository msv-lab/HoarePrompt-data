`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. Since `max_list` is updated to reference `lst`, the output state must reflect that `max_list` now holds the same contents as `lst`. The values of `list_of_lists`, `max_len`, and `lst` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but `max_list` now has the same value as `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must not be empty, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
