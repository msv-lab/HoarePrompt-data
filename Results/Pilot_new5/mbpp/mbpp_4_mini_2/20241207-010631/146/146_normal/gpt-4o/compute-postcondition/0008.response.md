The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`. The initial state indicates `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, which means the assignment does not change the value of `max_len`. Since `max_list` is only updated if `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`, and since `len(lst)` equals `max_len`, the condition is not met, and `max_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_len` maintains its value, and `max_list` remains as it was before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` remains unchanged.**
