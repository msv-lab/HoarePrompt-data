According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one more list after the current iteration. Since `list_of_lists` must not be empty at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that it has at least one list (which is `lst` in the current iteration). 

At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst` only if `len(lst)` is greater than the previous `max_len`. If `len(lst)` is not greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

After the iteration, the loop will proceed to the next element in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the next value of `lst` will be the next list in `list_of_lists`.

To execute the loop one more time:
- `list_of_lists` must contain at least one more list, meaning that it must have at least 2 lists in total.
- The next `lst` is the next list from `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` and `max_list` will only be updated if the `len(lst)` of the new list is greater than `max_len`.

State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst` if `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`**.
