According to the code, the loop iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `list_of_lists` must contain at least 3 lists. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists. The loop will proceed to the third list in the next iteration. 

Thus, `lst` will be assigned to the third list in `list_of_lists`, and the loop will also check if `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len` to potentially update `max_len` and `max_list`. 

State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 3 lists, lst is the third list in the list_of_lists, max_len remains unchanged if len(lst) is less than or equal to max_len, or max_len is equal to len(lst) and max_list is equal to lst if len(lst) is greater than max_len**
