The code assigns the length of `lst` to `max_len`. If `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` will be updated to that new length. The state of `max_list` is unchanged unless the condition regarding the length of `lst` (being greater than `max_len`) is met.

The previous state indicates that `max_len` remains unchanged if `len(lst)` is less than or equal to `max_len`. If `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`, the new value of `max_len` will be equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` will be set to `lst`.

Since the specific values of `len(lst)` and `max_len` are not provided, we can only declare the potential changes based on the conditions.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, if len(lst) > max_len then `max_len` is equal to len(lst) and `max_list` is equal to `lst`; else `max_len` remains unchanged.**
