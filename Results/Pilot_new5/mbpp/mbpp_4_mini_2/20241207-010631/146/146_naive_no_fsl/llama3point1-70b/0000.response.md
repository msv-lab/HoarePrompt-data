Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. According to the problem, the function should return a list of all sublists having the maximum length, but the implementation only returns the first sublist with the maximum length along with its length. 

For example, consider the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10]]`. The expected output should be `(4, [[6, 7, 8, 9]])`, but the provided implementation would return `(4, [6, 7, 8, 9])`, which does not include all maximum-length sublists if there are more than one.

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
