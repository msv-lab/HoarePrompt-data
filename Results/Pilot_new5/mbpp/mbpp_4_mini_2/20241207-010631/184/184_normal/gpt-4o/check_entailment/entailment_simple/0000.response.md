Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description. 

In detail, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums`, checking if the number is odd by using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs:
1. For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which correctly includes all odd numbers in the list.
2. For the input list `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output is `[45, 67, 93]`, which again correctly includes the odd numbers.
3. For the input list `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output is `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, capturing all odd numbers.

Since the function accurately addresses all requirements set forth in the problem description by successfully filtering out odd numbers, it is deemed correct.
