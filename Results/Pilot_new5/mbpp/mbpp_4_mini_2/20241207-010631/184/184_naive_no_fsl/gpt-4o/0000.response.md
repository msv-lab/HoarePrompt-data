Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `nums` and retains only those numbers that are odd (i.e., those that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`).

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, it returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which is correct.
2. For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, it returns `[45, 67, 93]`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, it returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which is correct as well.

Moreover, no edge cases or potential input scenarios indicate that the function may fail. For example:
- If given an empty list `[]`, the function would return `[]`, which is correct as there are no odd numbers.
- If given a list with all even numbers, such as `[2, 4, 6]`, the function would return `[]`, which is also correct.

Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all tested and potential cases.
