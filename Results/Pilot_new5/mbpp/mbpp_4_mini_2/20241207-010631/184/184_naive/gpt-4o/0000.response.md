Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly filters odd numbers from the input list by using a list comprehension, checking if each number is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided test cases confirm its functionality:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which is accurate.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`, which is also correct.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which meets the requirement as well.

Since the program works correctly for all tested inputs and adheres to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
