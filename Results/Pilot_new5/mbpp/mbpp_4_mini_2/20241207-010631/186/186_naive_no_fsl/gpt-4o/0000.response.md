Correctness: **False**

The function is supposed to extract the elementwise AND from two tuples, but the assertions indicate that the expected results do not match the output of the function. 

1. Let's analyze the first assertion:
   - Input: `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - Calculation:
     - `10 & 5` equals `0`
     - `4 & 2` equals `0`
     - `6 & 3` equals `2`
     - `9 & 3` equals `1`
   - Output: `(0, 0, 2, 1)` (This matches the assertion)

2. Second assertion:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - Calculation:
     - `1 & 5` equals `1`
     - `2 & 6` equals `2`
     - `3 & 7` equals `3`
     - `4 & 8` equals `0`
   - Output: `(1, 2, 3, 0)` (This matches the assertion)

3. Third assertion:
   - Input: `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - Calculation:
     - `8 & 7` equals `0`
     - `9 & 13` equals `9`
     - `11 & 14` equals `10`
     - `12 & 17` equals `12`
   - Output: `(0, 9, 10, 12)` (This does not match the assertion, which expects `(0, 9, 10, 0)`)

The third case fails, indicating that the function does not produce the expected output for all potential cases as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
