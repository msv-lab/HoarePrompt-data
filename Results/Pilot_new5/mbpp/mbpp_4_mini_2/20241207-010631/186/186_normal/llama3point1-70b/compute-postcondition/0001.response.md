The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the result of the bitwise AND operation applied to the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and return a tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operation on their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, both are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND operation applied to the corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2.**
