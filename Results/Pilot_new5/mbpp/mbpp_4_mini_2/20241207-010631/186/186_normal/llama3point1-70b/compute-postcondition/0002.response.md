Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND operation applied to the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. **
