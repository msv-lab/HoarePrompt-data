Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to extract elementwise information from two tuples. However, it performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. This operation does not align with the task of merely extracting elements or constructing a new tuple based on the input tuples without any specific operation.

For example, if you input the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected behavior based on the problem description is unclear; it does not specify that a bitwise operation should be performed. Instead, the problem description suggests extracting elements, which could imply creating a new tuple that combines the elements in some form, such as concatenation or simply returning them as they are.

In contrast, the current implementation computes:
- `(10 & 5)` which results in `0`
- `(4 & 2)` which results in `0`
- `(6 & 3)` which results in `2`
- `(9 & 3)` which results in `1`

This leads to the output `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is not a direct extraction of elements from the tuples. Similarly, the other test cases provided in the assertions follow the same incorrect logic.

Thus, the function does not adhere to the requirements stated in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
