To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description:** The task is to extract the element-wise bitwise AND from two given tuples.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

The code uses the `zip` function to pair up elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2` and then computes the bitwise AND for each pair of elements. The result is returned as a tuple.

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The program correctly implements the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples.
   - The use of `zip` ensures that only elements up to the length of the shorter tuple are processed, discarding any additional elements in the longer tuple. 

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem description does not specify what should happen if one or both tuples are empty. An empty tuple should logically yield an empty result since there are no elements to process.
   - The code does not seem to handle tuples of varying lengths beyond the shorter one being truncated, but this behavior is in line with the output hints.

3. **Output Hints Verification:**
   - The output hints state: "If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only compute the AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively discarding any additional elements in the longer tuple."
   - This aligns perfectly with the behavior of the `zip` function and the bitwise operations implemented in the code.

Given that the code adheres to the described functionality for the provided assertions and output hints, but we have identified a potential edge case where empty tuples might not be explicitly handled, we need to decide based on the strict requirement that the program must work correctly for every potential case.

### Conclusion:
While the program works correctly for most provided examples and meets the specified functionality in terms of the bitwise AND of elements, it does not explicitly mention how to handle empty tuples in the problem description. Thus, this oversight indicates that the program may not meet the required conditions for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The program does not explicitly handle the case of empty tuples. For instance, calling `func_1((), ())` would return an empty tuple, which is not addressed in the problem description or examples.
