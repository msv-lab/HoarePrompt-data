Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced according to the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Stack Usage**: The program utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. This is a standard approach to solve the problem of balanced parentheses, as it allows for the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle which is essential for matching brackets.

2. **Bracket Mapping**: The program defines a dictionary (`brackets`) that maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. This allows the function to easily check for matching pairs.

3. **Iterating Through Characters**: The function iterates over each character in the input string `expression`. It checks if the character is an opening bracket (to push onto the stack) or a closing bracket (to check for a match).

4. **Matching Logic**: When a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks if:
   - The stack is not empty (which would mean there's a corresponding opening bracket).
   - The last opening bracket (popped from the stack) matches the current closing bracket.
   If either condition fails, the function immediately returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were matched), and `False` otherwise.

This implementation correctly handles various cases:
- It correctly identifies balanced expressions like `"{[()()]}"` and `"{[()]}"`.
- It also recognizes unbalanced cases such as `"{[(])}"`, `"{"`, and `"([)]"`.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description, ensuring that it checks for balanced brackets in the provided expression. Therefore, it is deemed correct.
