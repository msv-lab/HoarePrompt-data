Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the first character of the expression. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is not in `brackets`, then `stack` remains empty, and if `char` is found in the values of `brackets`, it corresponds to the value in `brackets` after popping from `stack` (if `stack` were not empty).***
