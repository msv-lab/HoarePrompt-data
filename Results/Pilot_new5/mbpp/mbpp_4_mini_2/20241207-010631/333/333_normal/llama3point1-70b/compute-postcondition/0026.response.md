The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string that may contain various types of brackets (e.g., '()', '{}', '[]') and any other characters. If the brackets in the `expression` do not match the expected bracket for the current state of the stack, the function returns `False`. There are multiple conditions that might also lead to returning `False`. However, if all brackets in the `expression` are matched and the stack is empty, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `expression` and determine if all brackets are correctly matched and balanced, returning `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter expression and returns True if all brackets in the expression are matched and the stack is empty; otherwise, it returns False.**
