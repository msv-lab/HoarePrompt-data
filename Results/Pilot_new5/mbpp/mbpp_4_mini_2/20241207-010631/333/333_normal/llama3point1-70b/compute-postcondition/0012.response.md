According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` has more characters, the loop will execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, the `stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the first character of the expression. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `char` must be the second character in the `expression`. The `stack` will remain empty if `char` is not in `brackets`, or if `char` is in `brackets`, it will contain `char`. 

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of the expression.**
