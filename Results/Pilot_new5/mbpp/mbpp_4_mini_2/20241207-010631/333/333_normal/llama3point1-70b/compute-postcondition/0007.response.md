Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of the expression and is not in brackets. The current value of `char` is one of the values in `brackets`. Either `stack` is still empty, or the last element popped from `stack` does not correspond to `char` in `brackets`.***
