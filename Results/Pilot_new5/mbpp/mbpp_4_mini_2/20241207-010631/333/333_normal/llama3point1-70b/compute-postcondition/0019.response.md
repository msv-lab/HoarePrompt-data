The `stack` is updated to include the `char`, which is defined as the third character of `expression`. Since `stack` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, it will contain this character. The variable `expression` remains unchanged, and `char` retains its definition as the third character of `expression`. 

Output State: **`stack` is a list containing the third character of `expression`, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character of `expression`**.
