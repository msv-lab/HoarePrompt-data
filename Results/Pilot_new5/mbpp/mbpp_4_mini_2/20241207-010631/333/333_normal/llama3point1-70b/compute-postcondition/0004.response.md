The value of `char` is appended to the `stack`, which is initially an empty list. After the execution, `stack` will now contain one element, which is the value of `char`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains `char`, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is still the first character of the expression and is in `brackets`.

Output State: **`stack` contains `char`, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of the expression and is in `brackets`**.
