#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that may contain various types of parentheses (such as '()', '{}', '[]') and other characters.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string that has been fully processed, `stack` is empty if all parentheses are properly matched, otherwise it contains unmatched opening parentheses, and the function returns True if all parentheses are matched and False if they are not.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if all parentheses in the string 'expr' are matched and False if they are not, based on whether 'stack' is empty or contains unmatched opening parentheses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` and checks for properly matched parentheses, including '()', '{}', and '[]'. It returns True if all parentheses are matched and properly closed; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle or return any error for unmatched parentheses, and it assumes that the input string only contains parentheses and other characters without any other validation.
