The `stack` is updated by appending the `char` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The states of the variables after executing the code will reflect that `char` is now part of the `stack`, but we do not modify the other variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string that must have at least one more character remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` has `char` appended to it.**
