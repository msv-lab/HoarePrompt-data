Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a non-empty list, and `char` is the first character of `expr` that is not a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the top element of `stack` matches the value of `matching_pairs[char]`, and `char` is successfully matched with the last added element from `stack` after popping.***
