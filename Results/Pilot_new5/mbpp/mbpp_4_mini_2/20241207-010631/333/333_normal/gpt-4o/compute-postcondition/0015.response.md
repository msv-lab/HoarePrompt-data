Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` remains unchanged. If `stack` is empty or the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding pair for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
