Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Purpose of the Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if the given string `expr` contains balanced parentheses. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Handling Different Types of Parentheses**: The function checks for three types of parentheses: round `()`, curly `{}`, and square `[]`. It does so by maintaining a stack to keep track of opening parentheses encountered as it processes the input string.

3. **Logic for Matching Parentheses**: The logic implemented in the function ensures that:
   - When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack.
   - When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing parenthesis) or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening parenthesis. If either condition is met, the function returns `False`, indicating the expression is not balanced.
   - If the string has been fully processed and the stack is empty, it means all opening parentheses have been matched with their corresponding closing ones.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if all parentheses are matched and properly closed, and `False` otherwise, which directly meets the requirement stated in the problem description.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test the function with various scenarios, including cases with balanced parentheses and cases where parentheses are mismatched. The function correctly returns the expected results for these cases.

Overall, the implementation effectively checks for balanced parentheses as required by the problem description, making the program correct.
