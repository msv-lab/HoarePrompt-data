Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string with at least 4 characters, `first_digit` and `second_digit` are the first and second characters of `s` respectively, and they are not equal. If `i` is 4, the function will return False because `i` is even and `s[i]` is not equal to `first_digit`. Otherwise, there is no return value from the function.***
