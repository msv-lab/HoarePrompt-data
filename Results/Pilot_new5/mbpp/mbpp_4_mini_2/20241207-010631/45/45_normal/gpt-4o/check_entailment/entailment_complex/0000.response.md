The program provided correctly implements the logic to check whether a number is undulating according to the problem description.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Understanding "Undulating"**: An undulating number is defined as having digits alternating in a specific pattern. For example, `1212`, `121212`, `1010` are undulating, while `1221`, `1991`, and `1234` are not.

2. **Initial Length Check**: The program first checks if the length of the string representation of the number is less than 3. If it is, the function correctly returns `False`, since undulating numbers must have at least 3 digits.

3. **First Two Digits Check**: It compares the first two digits of the number. If they are the same, it returns `False`. This check ensures that for a number to be undulating, the first two digits must be distinct.

4. **Even/Odd Position Check**: The program then iterates through the characters of the string representation. It checks if characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. This is the essence of the undulating condition.

5. **Final Return**: If all the conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

### Test Cases:
The provided test cases:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` (correct, as it's undulating),
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False` (correct, as it is not undulating),
- `func_1(121)` returns `True` (correct, as it is undulating).

### Conclusion:
The function adheres to the problem description by implementing the checks necessary to determine if a number is undulating.

Correctness: **True**
