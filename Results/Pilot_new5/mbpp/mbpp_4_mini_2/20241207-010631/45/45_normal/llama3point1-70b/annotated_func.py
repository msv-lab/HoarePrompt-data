#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:

            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `undulating` is True if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence, otherwise `undulating` is False after examining all relevant digits.
    return undulating
    #The program returns True if the digits of string representation 'n' form an undulating sequence, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits form an undulating sequence (alternating between increasing and decreasing). It returns `True` if the digits form such a sequence and `False` otherwise. The function requires that `n` has at least two digits to perform this check accurately. If `n` has fewer than two digits, the function will still return `True` as the loop will not run, which may not align with the expected behavior described in the annotations.
