The `pass` statement does not change any variable values or states; it simply acts as a placeholder in the code. The existing conditions and values of the variables remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that has at least 2 digits, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True, and the current value of `n[i - 1]` is either less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i + 1]`, or `n[i - 1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i + 1]`.**
