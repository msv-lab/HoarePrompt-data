Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly check whether a number is undulating based on the given problem description. An undulating number alternates between two different digits. 

Hereâ€™s a case where the program does not work correctly:
- The input `212` should return `True` as it alternates between the digits `2` and `1`. However, according to the current implementation, since the length of the input is less than 3 and the first two digits are the same, it might return `False` when it shouldn't.

The program checks that the number must have at least three digits to be considered undulating, which isn't aligned with the understanding that undulating numbers can have fewer digits. Moreover, it doesn't account for cases where the sequence of digits might be correct but does not meet the arbitrary length requirement.

Thus, because there are cases where the program fails to satisfy the condition for undulating numbers, the correctness is **False**.
