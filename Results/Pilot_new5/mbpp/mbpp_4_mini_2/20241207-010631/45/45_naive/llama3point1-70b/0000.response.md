To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem Description:** The function should check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is one where the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing, meaning that no two adjacent digits can be the same and the sequence must follow a strict increase-decrease pattern or decrease-increase pattern.

**Given Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program converts the number into a string and checks if the digits exhibit an undulating pattern by iterating over the characters from index 1 to `len(n) - 1`.
2. The condition `if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` is used to check if a digit is part of a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence with its neighbors.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program fails to account for the first and last digits. It only checks the middle digits and does not validate if the first digit is part of an undulating sequence compared to the second digit, or if the last digit is part of an undulating sequence compared to the second-to-last digit.
- It can incorrectly classify a number like 121 as undulating because it checks conditions that allow adjacent digits to be equal in certain cases, which violates the undulating definition.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input `121`. According to the logic:
- For `i = 1`, it checks `1` (n[0]) and `2` (n[1]) and `1` (n[2]). It finds `1 < 2` and `2 > 1`, so it passes.
- However, `121` is not undulating, as it contains repeated digits and does not strictly alternate.

Thus, the program incorrectly identifies `121` as undulating.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly check all potential cases for undulating numbers, as demonstrated with the example `121`, which should return `False` but would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.
