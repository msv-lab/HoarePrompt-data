To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and ensure it adheres to the requirements.

### Problem Description:
- The function must take a tuple of tuples.
- It should return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each inner tuple.

### Analyzed Program:
1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numeric values.
  
2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - It initializes `num_elements` as the length of the first inner tuple. This assumes all inner tuples are of equal length.
   - It iterates over the range of `num_elements`, creating a list `elements_at_position` for each position `i`, which contains the `i-th` element from each inner tuple.
   - It computes the average of the values in `elements_at_position` by summing them and dividing by the number of inner tuples.
   - The average is appended to the list `averages`.
  
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the list `averages`, which should contain the average values for each position across all inner tuples.

### Assertions:
The provided assertions check if the function returns the expected averages for various test cases.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program correctly computes the average for each position across the tuples.
- It handles the case where all inner tuples have the same length, as it computes the average based on the same indexed elements across all inner tuples.
- The program does not explicitly check for cases where the inner tuples might be of different lengths but based on the problem description, it assumes all tuples are of the same structure.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
