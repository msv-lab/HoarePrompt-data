#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the average values of each position across all inner tuples.
    return averages
    #The program returns the list 'averages' containing the average values of each position across all inner tuples in 'tuples', where 'tuples' is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of average values for each position across all inner tuples. However, if any inner tuple is empty or if there are no inner tuples, a division by zero error may occur when calculating the averages, which is not handled in the code.
