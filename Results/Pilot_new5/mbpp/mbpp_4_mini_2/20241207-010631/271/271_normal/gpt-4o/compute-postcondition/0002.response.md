To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the initial conditions provided and the loop itself.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `num_elements`. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_elements` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_elements` has been set to a positive value. Additionally, since `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`, we need to check that `tuples` contains at least one inner tuple, and that this inner tuple is non-empty.

2. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 on each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` must be 0.

3. The state of the variable `averages` is not directly relevant for the loop to execute, as it is simply an empty list that will be populated during the loop iterations. However, it's important to acknowledge that it will be modified by the loop, but this does not influence the ability of the loop to commence.

Taking all of this into consideration, we need to ensure that:
- `tuples` contains at least one inner tuple that is non-empty (which means `num_elements` must be at least 1).
- `num_elements` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be initialized to 0.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
