`num_elements` is assigned the value of the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`. Since `tuples` is a tuple of tuples and each inner tuple contains numeric values, `num_elements` will be equal to the number of numeric values in the first inner tuple. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values; `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`.**
