The provided program is intended to compute the average of corresponding values from tuples within a tuple of tuples. The code uses the `zip` function to group the corresponding elements and then computes the average for each group.

On initial examination, the code appears to follow the problem description correctly. It calculates the averages of the numeric values in the inner tuples. However, we should consider edge cases to ensure correctness.

One potential edge case is when the input `tuples` is empty. The problem description states that if `tuples` is empty, it should return an empty list. The code does not explicitly handle this case, as the expression `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` would attempt to compute the averages, and `len(tuples)` would be 0, leading to a division by zero error.

The output hints support the notion that if the input is empty, the function will return an empty list. This implies that the program does not handle the case gracefully.

Given this edge case, we can conclude that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the case when `tuples` is empty, potentially resulting in a division by zero error.
