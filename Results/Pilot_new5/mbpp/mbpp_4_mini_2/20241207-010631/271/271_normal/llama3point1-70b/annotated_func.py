#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the sum of the numeric values from the inner tuples of 'tuples' divided by the number of inner tuples, calculated using the zip function to group values by their positions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples (`tuples`), where each inner tuple contains numeric values. It returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated by summing the corresponding elements of the inner tuples and dividing by the number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, it will return an empty list as there are no elements to average.
