Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples and calculates the average of the corresponding values at each position across the inner tuples. 

Here's why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Structure**: It accepts a tuple of tuples, which matches the description.
2. **Average Calculation**: The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to group the values by their positions, allowing it to compute the average for each position across all inner tuples.
3. **Handling of Values**: The program calculates the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of inner tuples using `len(tuples)`, which is consistent with the requirement to average the values.
4. **Empty Input**: If the input `tuples` is empty, it will correctly return an empty list, since `zip(*tuples)` would yield no tuples to iterate over. This case is also covered in the description.

Thus, the program always adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description, handling both typical and edge cases correctly.
