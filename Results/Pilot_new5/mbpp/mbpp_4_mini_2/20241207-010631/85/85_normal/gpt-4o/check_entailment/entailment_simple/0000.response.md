Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task described in the problem description. The problem requires finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. It calculates the minimum value (`min_val`) in the array using the `min()` function.
2. It calculates the maximum value (`max_val`) in the array using the `max()` function.
3. It computes the maximum difference (`max_diff`) by subtracting `min_val` from `max_val`.
4. Finally, it returns this maximum difference.

This approach accurately reflects the maximum difference between any two elements in the array because the maximum difference in a set of numbers is always the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. 

The assertions in the annotated program also serve to validate the correctness of the function with various test cases, confirming that the function behaves as expected.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all cases, and there are no scenarios where it would fail to provide the correct maximum difference.
