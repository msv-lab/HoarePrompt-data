Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, which matches the problem description. The assertions given in the program demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the specified input cases, returning the expected tuples. 

For example:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which is correct.

There are no missing edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail the description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
