#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, where b and a are numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation as it simply swaps the order of the input parameters in the return statement.
