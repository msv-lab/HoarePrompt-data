The provided program is designed to take in two numbers and return them in a tuple with the second number first, effectively swapping their positions. 

The code itself is as follows:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```

It looks correct at first glance, as the function `func_1` does indeed return a tuple where the second argument `b` comes before the first argument `a`. Given the function calls in the assertions:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

These outputs are consistent with the problem description.

Now, examining the output hints: "The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and it returns the values of `b` and `a` in that order, effectively swapping their positions. There are no edge cases or missing functionality since the function performs this operation directly and simply."

The output hints confirm that the function operates correctly based on the problem description. There are no mention of edge cases that the function does not handle, and since the function is straightforward, there aren't any potential edge cases that could lead to it failing.

The description and hints both align with the function's implementation. As such, I cannot identify any input or edge case where the program will not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them in a tuple in the expected order for all cases.
