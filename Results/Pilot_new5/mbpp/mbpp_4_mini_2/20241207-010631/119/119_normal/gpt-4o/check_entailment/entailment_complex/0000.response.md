Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why the program is correct:
1. The function `func_1(a, b)` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both numbers, as specified in the problem description.
2. The function returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which means it returns the second number first and then the first number, exactly as required by the problem description.
3. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as intended for various inputs:
   - `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the expected output.
   - `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which matches the expected output.
   - `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which matches the expected output.

Since the function consistently returns the second number followed by the first number in a tuple, it fulfills the problem requirements for all cases presented. Thus, the program is correct.
