Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which states that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The implementation of `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns `(b, a)`, which matches the expected output for all tested cases.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as intended for multiple pairs of input values:
- For `func_1(10, 20)`, it returns `(20, 10)`.
- For `func_1(15, 17)`, it returns `(17, 15)`.
- For `func_1(100, 200)`, it returns `(200, 100)`.

Since the function has been tested with representative examples and it produces the correct output for these cases, I cannot find any potential cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Thus, the function is deemed correct.
