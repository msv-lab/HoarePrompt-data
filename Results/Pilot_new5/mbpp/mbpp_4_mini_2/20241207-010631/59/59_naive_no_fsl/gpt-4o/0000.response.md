Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list as required by the problem description. It combines the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list using the built-in `sorted()` function. 

The provided assertions test a variety of cases, including:
- Different values in the lists.
- Duplicates across and within the lists.
- A mix of unordered input.

After reviewing the implementation and provided test cases, it correctly handles all of these scenarios and returns a sorted list as expected.

Since I cannot find any input where the function fails to meet the problem description requirements, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
