Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It achieves this by concatenating the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) and then applying the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list.

The implementation will handle various scenarios, such as:

1. All three lists being empty: The result will be an empty list, which is sorted.
2. Lists with varying lengths and contents: The merging and sorting will correctly combine and order all elements.
3. Lists containing duplicate elements: The sorting will ensure that duplicates are maintained in the final sorted list.
4. Lists containing different data types: The sorting will raise a TypeError if the lists contain incomparable types (e.g., integers and strings), which is a behavior consistent with Python's sorting rules.

Overall, since the function correctly addresses the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
