The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list that contains all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a sorted list containing all integers from those lists combined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all integers from these lists combined.**
