Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single list by concatenating them and then uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:
1. **Merging**: The program combines the three input lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list that contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is then applied to the concatenated list, ensuring that the final output is a sorted list.
3. **Input Type**: The problem description specifies that the lists contain integers, and the `sorted()` function is designed to handle lists of integers, maintaining the correct order.

Since the program successfully merges and sorts the lists as required by the problem description, it is correct in every potential case.
