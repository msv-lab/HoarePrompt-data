Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function, which gives the Unicode code point of the character. Since ASCII values are a subset of Unicode code points for the standard characters, the returned value for any valid ASCII character will also be accurate.

The assertions provided before the function call serve to test the function, confirming that it correctly returns the ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. These values (65, 82, and 83, respectively) match the expected ASCII values.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly finding the ASCII value of a character.
