The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. The problem description specifies that the function should find the ASCII value of a character.

Upon initial assessment, the code appears to perform correctly for valid single character inputs. The function `ord(char)` does indeed return the ASCII value (or Unicode code point) for characters passed to it.

However, considering potential edge cases, the program does not handle inputs that are not a single character string. The output hints specify that the function does not manage cases where `char` is not a single character string, which may lead to errors.

Examining the output hints indicates that they agree with the code's functionality; the hints accurately describe the behavior of `ord()` and how it operates on character input. However, since the output hints mention a lack of handling for invalid inputs, this reveals a shortcoming in the code that fails to adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.

For instance, if `func_1('AB')` or `func_1('')` or `func_1(123)` is called, it would lead to unexpected behavior or errors, demonstrating that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
