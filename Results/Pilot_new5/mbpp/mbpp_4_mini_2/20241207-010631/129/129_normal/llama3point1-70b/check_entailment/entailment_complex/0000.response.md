Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct according to the problem description because while it is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character string, it does not handle potential issues with input validation. The comments mention that the function assumes valid input, but the problem description does not specify that the function can only be called with valid inputs. 

If a user calls the function with an input that is not a single character (e.g., an empty string or a string with more than one character), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`, which is not covered in the problem description. Thus, the program does not fully adhere to the requirements as it lacks robustness against invalid inputs. 

In summary, while the function correctly computes the ASCII value of valid single character strings, it does not gracefully handle cases where the input does not meet the criteria (a single character), leading to potential runtime errors.
