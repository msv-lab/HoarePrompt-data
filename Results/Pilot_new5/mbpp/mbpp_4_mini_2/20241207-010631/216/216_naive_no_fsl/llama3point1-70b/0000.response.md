To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description, which requires checking if a list contains consecutive numbers.

### Analyzing the Program
The program first sorts the input list `lst`, and then it uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check two conditions:
1. It checks that the difference between each consecutive pair of sorted elements is exactly 1, which ensures they are consecutive.
2. It checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, which ensures there are no duplicate numbers.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. An empty list: The function should return `False` since there are no numbers to be consecutive.
2. A list with a single number (e.g., `[5]`): The function should return `True` since a single number can be considered as a consecutive sequence.
3. A list with two numbers that are not consecutive (e.g., `[1, 3]`): The function should return `False`.
4. A list with duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 2]`): The function should return `False` since the numbers are not unique.
5. A list that is already in order with consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`): The function should return `True`.
6. A list that is not sorted but still contains consecutive numbers (e.g., `[3, 1, 2]`): The function should return `True`.

### Test Cases
- For an empty list `[]`, the program returns `True` (incorrect).
- For a single element list `[5]`, the program returns `True` (correct).
- For a two-element list `[1, 3]`, the program returns `False` (correct).
- For a list with duplicates `[1, 2, 2]`, the program returns `False` (correct).
- For a sorted consecutive list `[1, 2, 3]`, the program returns `True` (correct).
- For an unsorted consecutive list `[3, 2, 1]`, the program returns `True` (correct).

### Conclusion
The program incorrectly handles the edge case of an empty list, returning `True` instead of `False`. This shows that there is at least one input where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
