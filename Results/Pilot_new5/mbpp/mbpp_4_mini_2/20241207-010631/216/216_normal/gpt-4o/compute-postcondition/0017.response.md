Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted list does not contain at least two consecutive integers. If the sorted list contains at least two consecutive integers, it returns True. However, it does not check for lists with fewer than two elements; hence, if `lst` has only one element, it also returns False, which is an implicit edge case not stated in the annotations. **
