`lst_sorted` is assigned the sorted version of `lst`. Since `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` will be a new list containing the elements of `lst` in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers derived from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers derived from `lst`.**
