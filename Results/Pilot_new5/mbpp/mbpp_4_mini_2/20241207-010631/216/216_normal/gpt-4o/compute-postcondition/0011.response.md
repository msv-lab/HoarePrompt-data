According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the current index `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. 

For the loop to be executed once more, `i` must be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, which means `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is 2). 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration needs to be updated to reflect this situation.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 3 integers, and `i` is 2.**
