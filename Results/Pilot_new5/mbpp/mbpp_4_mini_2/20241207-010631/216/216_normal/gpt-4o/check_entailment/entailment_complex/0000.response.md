The program is designed to check whether a given list contains consecutive integers. Let's break down the provided code and annotations to determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Checking for Empty List**: The function first checks if the list `lst` is empty. If it is empty, the function correctly returns `False`, as an empty list cannot contain any consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list, which is necessary for checking consecutive integers.

3. **Checking Consecutiveness**: The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each consecutive element is equal to 1. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.

4. **Returning True**: If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`, indicating that all numbers in the list are consecutive.

However, there is a critical edge case that the function does not explicitly handle:

- If the list contains only one element (e.g., `[5]`), the function will return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. A single number does not constitute a set of consecutive numbers. The function's logic does not account for the minimum requirement of at least two elements to define consecutive integers.

Therefore, the function is incorrect as it fails to correctly handle the case where the list has only one element, which should return `False`.

Correctness: **False**
