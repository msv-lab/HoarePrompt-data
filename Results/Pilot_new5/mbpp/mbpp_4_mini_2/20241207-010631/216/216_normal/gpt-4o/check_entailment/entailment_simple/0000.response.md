The provided program is intended to check if a given list contains consecutive integers. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem description.

1. **Empty List Check**: 
   - The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `False`. This behavior is acceptable because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The function then sorts the list. Sorting is necessary to ensure that we can easily check for consecutive integers.

3. **Consecutive Check**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of consecutive integers is equal to 1. If it finds any pair that does not satisfy this condition, it returns `False`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`, indicating that the numbers are consecutive.

### Key Points:
- The function correctly identifies whether the list is empty and handles that case.
- It correctly sorts the list and checks for consecutive numbers by verifying the difference between sorted elements.
- The assertions provided at the beginning of the program also support that the function behaves as intended for the test cases given.

### Boundary Cases:
- The function does not specify behavior for lists with fewer than two integers explicitly, but logically:
  - A single number should be treated as "not consecutive" since there is no pair to compare.
  - The empty list case is already handled.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly according to the problem description for all reasonable inputs. It correctly identifies lists with consecutive integers and cases where they are not present.

Correctness: **True**
