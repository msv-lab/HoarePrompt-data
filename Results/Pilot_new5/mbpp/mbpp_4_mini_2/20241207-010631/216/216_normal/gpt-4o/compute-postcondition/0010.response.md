Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If the difference is equal to 1, the program continues without returning anything.***
