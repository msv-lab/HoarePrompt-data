Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary that contains the count of each digit present in `digit_str`. If `n` is 0, `digit_str` is "0", and `frequency` is {'0': 1}. If `n` is greater than 0, `frequency` corresponds to the counts of each digit in the string representation of `n`.**
