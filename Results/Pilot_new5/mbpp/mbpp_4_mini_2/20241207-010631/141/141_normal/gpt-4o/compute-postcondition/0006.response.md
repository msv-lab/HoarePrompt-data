The code assigns the value 1 to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. Since `digit` is the first character of `digit_str` and it was previously not in `frequency`, it is now added to the dictionary with a frequency count of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with `digit` as a key and value 1, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`.**
