Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n` with at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, its count is increased by 1. Otherwise, `frequency` has an entry for `digit` with a count of 1.***
