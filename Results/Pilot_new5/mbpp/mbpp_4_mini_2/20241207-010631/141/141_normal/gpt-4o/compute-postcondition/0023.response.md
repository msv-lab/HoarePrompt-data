Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` has at least one more item, and `count` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If `count` is greater than `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the behavior of the function is not specified beyond this point.***
