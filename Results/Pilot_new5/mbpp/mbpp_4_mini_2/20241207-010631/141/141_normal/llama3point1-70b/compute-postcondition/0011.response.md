Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for every character `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If any count exceeds, the function would have returned False, indicating an invalid state.**
