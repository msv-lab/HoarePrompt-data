According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `str_n`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `str_n`, which is the string representation of `n`. 

1. If `n` is a non-negative integer, then `str_n` will be a string that represents the digits of `n`, which means it will contain at least one character if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `str_n` will be the string "0", allowing for the loop to execute once.

2. If `n` is 0, `str_n` is "0" and the loop will execute once with `digit` being '0'.

3. If `n` is greater than 0, `str_n` will contain multiple characters corresponding to the digits of `n`, and the loop will execute for each digit in `str_n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `str_n` must not be an empty string. Since `str_n` is derived from `n`, it is guaranteed to have at least one character because `n` is a non-negative integer.

At the start of the loop, the state can be represented as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `str_n`**
