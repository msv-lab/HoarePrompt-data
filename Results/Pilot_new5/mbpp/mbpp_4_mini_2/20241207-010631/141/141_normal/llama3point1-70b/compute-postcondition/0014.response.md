The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it to its string representation. It iterates through each digit in this string and counts how many times each digit appears. If the count of any digit exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If all digit counts are less than or equal to their corresponding integer values, the function returns `True`. The edge case where `n` is 0 will return `True`, as the count of digit '0' in the string representation is 1, which is not greater than the integer value of 0. Thus, the functionality of the function does not align perfectly with the annotations, as the function will return `True` for `n = 0`, which is not explicitly mentioned.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, and returns `False` if any digit in its string representation appears more times than its integer value; otherwise, it returns `True`. It will also return `True` for the case when `n` is 0. **
