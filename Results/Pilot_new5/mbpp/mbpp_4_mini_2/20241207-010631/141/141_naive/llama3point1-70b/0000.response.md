To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to verify if the function correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Functionality**: The function converts the integer `n` into a string `str_n`, then iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it counts how many times that digit appears in the string and compares that count to the integer value of the digit itself.

2. **Logic Check**: The condition `if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit)` checks if the frequency of the digit is greater than the digit's value. If it is, the function returns `False`. If all digits meet the condition, it returns `True`.

### Potential Cases to Test

Let's consider some potential cases:

- **Case 1**: For the number `112`:
  - The digit `1` appears twice (`count('1') = 2`) and `int('1') = 1`. The condition fails (2 > 1), so it should return `False`. The function works correctly here.
  
- **Case 2**: For the number `221`:
  - The digit `2` appears twice (`count('2') = 2`) and `int('2') = 2`. The condition passes. The digit `1` appears once (`count('1') = 1`) and `int('1') = 1`. The condition passes again. It should return `True`. The function works correctly here.

- **Case 3**: For the number `333`:
  - The digit `3` appears three times (`count('3') = 3`) and `int('3') = 3`. The condition passes. It should return `True`. The function works correctly here.

- **Case 4**: For the number `4444`:
  - The digit `4` appears four times (`count('4') = 4`) and `int('4') = 4`. The condition passes. It should return `True`. The function works correctly here.

### Edge Case to Consider

- **Case 5**: For the number `100`:
  - The digit `1` appears once (`count('1') = 1`) and `int('1') = 1`. The condition passes. The digit `0` appears twice (`count('0') = 2`) and `int('0') = 0`. Here, `2 > 0` fails, so it should return `False`. The function works correctly here.

- **Case 6**: For the number `122333`:
  - The digit `1` appears once (`count('1') = 1`) and `int('1') = 1`. The condition passes. The digit `2` appears twice (`count('2') = 2`) and `int('2') = 2`. The condition passes. The digit `3` appears three times (`count('3') = 3`) and `int('3') = 3`. The condition passes. It should return `True`. The function works correctly here.

### Conclusion

After analyzing various potential cases, there is no input for which the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself for all tested cases.

Correctness: **True**.
