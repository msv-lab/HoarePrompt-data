Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case where the input integer has digits that appear more frequently than their value. For example, consider the input `111`. In this case, the digit `1` appears three times (frequency of `1` is `3`), but since `3 > 1`, the program should return `False`. The current implementation would incorrectly return `True` for this input. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
