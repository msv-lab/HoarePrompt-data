Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * Ï€ * radius^2 * height. It does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative, nor does it account for the possibility of non-numeric inputs. **
