Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to calculate the volume of a cone as outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

This matches the formula for the volume of a cone, which is exactly what the problem description requires. 

The assertions provided check the correctness of the function with specific test cases. Each assertion uses the `math.isclose` method to verify that the computed volume is approximately equal to the expected volume (within a relative tolerance of 0.001), ensuring that the function behaves correctly for various inputs.

Additionally, the comment in the code clarifies that the function assumes `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, which is consistent with the physical interpretation of a cone's dimensions.

Overall, since the function uses the correct mathematical formula for the volume of a cone and the assertions confirm its accuracy, the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
