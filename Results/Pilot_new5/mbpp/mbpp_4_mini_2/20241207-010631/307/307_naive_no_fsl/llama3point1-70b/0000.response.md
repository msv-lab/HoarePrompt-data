To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function that returns the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

### Triangular Numbers
Triangular numbers can be calculated using the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \]
where `k` is the index of the triangular number.

### Code Analysis
The code provided works as follows:
1. It initializes an index `idx` to 1.
2. In a while loop, it computes the triangular number for the current `idx`.
3. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. If the condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.
5. If not, it increments `idx` and repeats the process.

### Testing Potential Cases
1. For `n = 1`: The triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, ... The first triangular number with at least 1 digit is `1` (index 1).
2. For `n = 2`: The triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... The smallest triangular number with at least 2 digits is `10` (index 4).
3. For `n = 3`: The triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ... The smallest triangular number with at least 3 digits is `120` (index 15).
4. For `n = 4`: The triangular numbers continue as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ..., and the first triangular number with at least 4 digits is `2200` (index 66).

The code correctly continues to generate triangular numbers and checks their digit length.

### Edge Cases
- If `n` is 0 or negative, the code will enter an infinite loop since it will never find a triangular number with 0 or fewer digits. This case should ideally be handled to avoid an infinite loop.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 0 properly. Therefore, it can lead to incorrect behavior under such circumstances.

Correctness: **False**
