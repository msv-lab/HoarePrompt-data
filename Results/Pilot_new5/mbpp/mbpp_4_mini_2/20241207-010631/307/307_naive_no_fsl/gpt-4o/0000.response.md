To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1(n)`. 

### Problem Description
The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Understanding Triangular Numbers
Triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The `k`-th triangular number is given by the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \]
The function should return the smallest `k` such that the number of digits in `T_k` is equal to `n`.

### Analyzing the Implementation
The provided implementation of the function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes `k` to 1.
2. It enters an infinite loop and calculates the `k`-th triangular number.
3. It checks the number of digits in the triangular number.
4. If the number of digits matches `n`, it returns `k`.
5. If not, it increments `k` and repeats.

### Testing the Function
The assertions provided:
- `assert func_1(2) == 4`
- `assert func_1(3) == 14`
- `assert func_1(4) == 45`

These assertions indicate that the function is expected to return:
- For 2 digits: The smallest triangular number is 3 (which is `T_4`), hence `k = 4`.
- For 3 digits: The smallest triangular number is 105 (which is `T_14`), hence `k = 14`.
- For 4 digits: The smallest triangular number is 220 (which is `T_20`), hence `k = 20`.

### Finding Edge Cases
The function dynamically calculates triangular numbers until it finds one with the specified number of digits. However, we need to consider:
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1. It will return an infinite loop since there are no triangular numbers with 0 or negative digits.

Let's test with a case:
- If `n = 0`, the function will not terminate because it will never find a triangular number with 0 digits.

### Conclusion
Since the function does not account for the case where `n` is less than 1, it does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, we conclude that the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**  
The program fails when `n` is 0 or negative, as it will enter an infinite loop without returning a valid index.
