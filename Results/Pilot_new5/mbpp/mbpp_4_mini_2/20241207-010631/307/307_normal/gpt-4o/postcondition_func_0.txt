The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of digits in a triangular number. It returns the smallest integer `k` such that the triangular number corresponding to `k` has exactly `n` digits. The function continues to calculate triangular numbers until it finds one that meets this condition. There are no checks for invalid input, so if `n` is less than 1 or not an integer, the behavior is undefined.
