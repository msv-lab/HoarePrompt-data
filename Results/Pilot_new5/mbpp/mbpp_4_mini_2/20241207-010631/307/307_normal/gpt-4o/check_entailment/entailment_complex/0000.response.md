Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. Let's break down why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). This is the correct formula for calculating the k-th triangular number.

2. **Counting Digits**: The program checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and using `len(str(triangular_number))`. This correctly counts the digits in the triangular number.

3. **Finding the Smallest Index**: The program starts with \( k = 1 \) and enters an infinite loop where it computes triangular numbers while incrementing \( k \) each time. Once it finds a triangular number that has exactly `n` digits, it returns \( k \). This aligns with the requirement of finding the smallest index \( k \) such that the triangular number has exactly \( n \) digits.

4. **Correct Assertions**: The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) are consistent with the expected outputs for those inputs, confirming that the function behaves as intended for these specific cases.

5. **Input Validity**: The function is designed with the assumption that \( n \) is a positive integer. Although the program does not explicitly check for invalid inputs (such as \( n \leq 0 \)), it is implied that the function is intended to be used with valid positive integers as specified in the problem description. 

Overall, the implementation meets the specified requirements of the problem description, confirming that it is correct.
