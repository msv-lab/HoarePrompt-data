Since the loop statement is `while True`, it indicates that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit break condition inside the loop body. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**.
