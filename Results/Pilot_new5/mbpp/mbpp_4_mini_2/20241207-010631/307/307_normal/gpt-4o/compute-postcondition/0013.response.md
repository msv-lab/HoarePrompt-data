The `triangular_number` is assigned the value of the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows:

```
triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
                   = 3 * 4 // 2
                   = 12 // 2
                   = 6
```

Thus, the value of `triangular_number` is updated to 6. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 6.**
