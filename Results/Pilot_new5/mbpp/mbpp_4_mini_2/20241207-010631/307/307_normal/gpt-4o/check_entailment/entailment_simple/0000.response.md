Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of finding the index of the smallest triangular number that has a specified number of digits (n). Here's the explanation of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function `func_1(n)` calculates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the correct mathematical representation of the k-th triangular number.

2. **Digit Count Verification**: The program checks the number of digits in the calculated triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))`. This correctly determines the number of digits in the triangular number.

3. **Looping Until Condition Met**: The program uses a `while True` loop, incrementing `k` each time until it finds the first triangular number with exactly `n` digits. This ensures that as soon as a triangular number with the desired digit count is found, it returns the index `k`.

4. **Correct Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code confirm correct output for the cases of 2, 3, and 4 digits, showing that the function works as intended for these specific inputs.

5. **End Condition**: The program will eventually find a triangular number with n digits for any positive integer n, ensuring that it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem specifications and provides the correct output for the specified cases, making it a correct implementation.
