The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `k` is 1, so after the increment, `k` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged, and the condition about the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` still holds true, as there is no indication that it has changed due to the increment of `k`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
