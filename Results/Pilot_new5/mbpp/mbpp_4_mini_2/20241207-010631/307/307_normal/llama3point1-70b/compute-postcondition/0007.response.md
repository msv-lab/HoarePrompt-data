According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, I do not need to make any adjustments to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1.**
