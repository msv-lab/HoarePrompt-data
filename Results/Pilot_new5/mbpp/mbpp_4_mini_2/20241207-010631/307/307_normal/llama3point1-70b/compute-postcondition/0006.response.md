The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 1, thus the new value will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the length of `triangular_num` in relation to `n` still holds true. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1. The length of `triangular_num` when converted to a string is less than `n`.**
