The variable `triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The previous value of `idx` is 2. Therefore, `triangular_num` becomes `2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 * 3 // 2`, and then to `3`. The values of `n` remain unchanged since the calculation does not affect it. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3.**
