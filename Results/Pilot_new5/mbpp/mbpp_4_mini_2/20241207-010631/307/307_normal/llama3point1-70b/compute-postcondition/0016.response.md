The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 3, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 6, and `idx` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 6, `idx` is 4.**
