The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_num` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value, so the output state reflects the updated value of `idx`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 3, `idx` is 3**.
