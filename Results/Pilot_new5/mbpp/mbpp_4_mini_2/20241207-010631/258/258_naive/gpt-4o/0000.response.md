Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic for determining whether a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is one that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

1. The function `func_1` converts the number `n` to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` and checks if this sum is equal to the original number `n`.

The provided assertions correctly test the function with known Armstrong numbers (153 is an Armstrong number) and non-Armstrong numbers (259 and 4458 are not). The logic handles all edge cases for non-negative integers, which is the typical domain for Armstrong number checks. Therefore, I cannot find any input or potential case where the program fails to follow the problem description.
