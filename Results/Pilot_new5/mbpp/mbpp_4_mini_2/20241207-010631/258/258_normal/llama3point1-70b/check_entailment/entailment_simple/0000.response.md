Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The program follows this logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(num)` accepts a non-negative integer (`num`), as specified.
2. **String Conversion**: The code converts the number to a string to iterate through each digit, which is necessary for calculating the Armstrong condition.
3. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of the string representation of the number to determine how many digits it has.
4. **Sum Calculation**: It initializes a `sum` variable and iteratively computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits (`num_len`).
5. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if the computed sum is equal to the original number (`num`), returning `True` if they are equal (indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

The logic and implementation in the program correctly align with the definition of an Armstrong number, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description for all non-negative integer inputs. Therefore, the program can be deemed correct.
