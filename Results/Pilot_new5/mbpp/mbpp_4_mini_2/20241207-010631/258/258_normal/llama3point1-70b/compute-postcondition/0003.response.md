According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_str`. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must not be an empty string, which implies that `num` must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0 (since it is the string representation of `num`). 

The initial state shows that `sum` is 0, which does not affect the ability of the loop to execute. However, `num_len` should reflect the length of `num_str`. As `num_str` is derived from `num`, if `num` is 0, then `num_str` would be "0" and `num_len` would be 1.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `num` must be non-negative, `num_str` must be a string of at least one character, and `num_len` should be equal to the length of `num_str`.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must be a non-empty string, `num_len` must equal the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**
