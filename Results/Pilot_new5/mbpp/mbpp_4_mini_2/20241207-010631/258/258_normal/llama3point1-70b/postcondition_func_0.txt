The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns True if `num` is an Armstrong number (i.e., the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals `num`), and False otherwise. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as it assumes `num` is always a non-negative integer.
