Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or Narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Assumption**: The program starts with the assumption that `num` is a non-negative integer, as stated in the annotated comments. This aligns with the problem description, which does not require handling of negative integers or non-integer inputs.

2. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, which is a correct approach for extracting digits.

3. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of the string representation of the number, which is necessary for raising each digit to the correct power.

4. **Summation Logic**: The program initializes a sum variable and correctly accumulates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits (`num_len`).

5. **Final Comparison**: Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

Because the program accurately follows the procedure of checking for Armstrong numbers as described in the problem statement, it is deemed correct.
