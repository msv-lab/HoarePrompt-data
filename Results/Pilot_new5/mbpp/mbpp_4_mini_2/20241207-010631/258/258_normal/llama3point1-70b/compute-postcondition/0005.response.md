According to the code, the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `num_str`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `num_str` is a non-empty string, and the loop has processed up to the last character. Since `num_len` must equal the length of `num_str`, the loop will execute again for each character until all characters in `num_str` have been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `sum` is equal to `0 plus int(digit)`, meaning `sum` has been updated with the integer value of the last processed digit. The loop will continue until all digits in `num_str` have been processed.

To execute one more time, we need to consider that the loop variable `digit` will take the next character from `num_str`. If `num_str` has `num_len` characters, the loop can only execute for indices from `0` to `num_len - 1`. Hence, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `num_str` has at least one more character beyond the current index.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least one more character, `num_len` must equal the length of `num_str`, `sum` is equal to 0 plus `int(digit)` for the next digit in `num_str`**
