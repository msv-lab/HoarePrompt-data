The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit of the non-negative integer `n`, raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, is equal to `n` itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a boolean indicating if it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` if the sum of each digit of `n`, raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, is equal to `n`; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
