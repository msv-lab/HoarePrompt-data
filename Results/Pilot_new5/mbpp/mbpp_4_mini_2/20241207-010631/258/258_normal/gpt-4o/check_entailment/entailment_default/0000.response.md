The provided program aims to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program converts the number `n` to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string, which corresponds to the number of digits in `n`.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this sum equals the original number `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program should handle the edge case of `0`, which is an Armstrong number since \(0^1 = 0\).
- It should also handle single-digit numbers correctly, as any single-digit number \(d\) satisfies \(d^1 = d\).
- The function should work for larger non-negative integers.

### Review of the Output Hints:
- The output hints state that the function returns `True` if `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`. It confirms that the function correctly handles all non-negative integers, including `0`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic for checking Armstrong numbers as described in the problem statement and the output hints confirm that it works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like `0`, it appears to follow the problem description accurately.

Thus, I cannot find an example where the program does not work correctly based on the provided problem description and output hints.

Correctness: **True**.
