Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits \( n \) is an integer such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. The function `func_1` adheres to this definition by:

1. Converting the input integer `n` to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Calculating the number of digits in `n` using `len(num_str)`.
3. Computing the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
4. Finally, it checks if this calculated sum equals the original number `n`, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The function has been verified against several test cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True`, as \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False`, as \( 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259 \).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False`, as \( 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458 \).

These assertions confirm that the program functions correctly according to the problem description for the tested cases. 

Thus, the function follows the required specifications for all possible non-negative integers, confirming its correctness.
