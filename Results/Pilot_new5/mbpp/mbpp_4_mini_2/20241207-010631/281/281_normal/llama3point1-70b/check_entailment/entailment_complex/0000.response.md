Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find even numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `numbers`, which is specified in the annotations as a list of integers.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the `numbers` list.
3. For each number, it checks if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This condition returns `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers.
4. The list comprehension constructs a new list that includes only the numbers for which the condition evaluates to `True`, effectively filtering out all odd numbers.

The final output of the function is a list containing only the even integers from the original list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program will always return a correct list of even numbers regardless of the input (as long as the input is a list of integers). 

Thus, the function fulfills the problem's requirements for every potential case, confirming its correctness.
