Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers`, checking if each number is even by evaluating `num % 2 == 0`. This approach correctly captures all even numbers, including zero, and the provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the specific test cases given.

Since I cannot find any example where the program fails to satisfy the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
