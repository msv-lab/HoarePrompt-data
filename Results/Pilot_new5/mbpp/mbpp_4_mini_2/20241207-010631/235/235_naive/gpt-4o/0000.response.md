Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit (using `n % 10`), adds it to a total sum, and then removes that last digit from `n` (using integer division `n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes zero. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function works for the given test cases:
- For `345`, the digits are `3`, `4`, and `5`, which sum to `12`.
- For `12`, the digits are `1` and `2`, which sum to `3`.
- For `97`, the digits are `9` and `7`, which sum to `16`.

Additionally, there are no edge cases that the function misses, as it correctly handles all non-negative integers, including the case where `n = 0`, which correctly returns `0`. Therefore, all potential cases are covered, confirming the correctness of the program.
