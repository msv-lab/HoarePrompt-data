#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles any non-negative integer by converting it to a string, iterating through each character, converting them back to integers, and summing those integers. There are no edge cases regarding negative numbers as the input is explicitly stated to be non-negative.
