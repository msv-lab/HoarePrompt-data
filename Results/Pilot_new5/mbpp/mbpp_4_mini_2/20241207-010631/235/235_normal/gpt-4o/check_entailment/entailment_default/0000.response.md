The given Python function `func_1` is expected to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total
```

- The function initializes a variable `total` to zero.
- It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than zero.
- Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division (using `n //= 10`).
- Finally, it returns `total`.

Now, let's consider the output hints provided: 
"The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns this sum. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, as there are no digits to sum."

This indicates that the function should also handle the case when `n` is 0. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and `total` will remain 0, which is indeed the correct result for this specific input. 

Next, we should consider edge cases:
- If `n` is 0: It returns 0, which is correct.
- If `n` is a single digit (e.g., 5): The sum is correct since it returns 5.
- If `n` is a multi-digit number (e.g., 345): The sum of digits is correctly calculated as 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and provide a reasonable description of its behavior across all tested cases, including the edge case of 0.

However, to ensure that it covers all potential cases, we can confirm:
- For any non-negative integer, the function correctly computes the sum of its digits.
- The handling of `n = 0` is implicitly correct since it returns 0 as expected.

Since I cannot identify any scenario where the function fails to meet the problem description, and all tested cases including 0 work as required, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it accurately sums the digits of any non-negative integer, including the case of 0, as specified in the problem description.
