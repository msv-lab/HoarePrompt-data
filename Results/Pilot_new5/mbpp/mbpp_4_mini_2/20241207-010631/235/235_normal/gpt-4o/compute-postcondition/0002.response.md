The value of `total` is incremented by `n % 10`, where `n` is greater than 0. This means `n % 10` will return the last digit of `n`, which is guaranteed to be a positive digit (from 1 to 9). Thus, `total` will be updated from 0 to `n % 10`.

Since `total` is initially 0 and will be updated, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10**
