To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character `char`.
2. If `char` only appears once, it uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove that single occurrence.
3. If `char` appears multiple times, it constructs a new string that excludes the first and last occurrences.
4. If `char` is not found, it returns the original string `s`.

### Edge Cases:
- The code handles when `char` is not in `s`, appearing once, or appearing multiple times.
- However, we need to verify how it behaves in certain scenarios:
  - If the string is empty (`s = ""`).
  - If `char` is the only character in `s` (`s = "a", char = "a"`).
  - If `s` consists of the same character repeated (`s = "aaa", char = "a"`).

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`.
- It returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed if it appears once, or with all occurrences of `char` removed if it appears multiple times. 
- If `char` is not present, it returns the string `s` unchanged.

### Verification of Output Hints:
- The hints suggest it handles cases correctly for when `char` appears once and multiple times. 
- The handling of the case when `char` appears only once seems to be correctly handled by the code.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String:**
   - Input: `func_1("", "a")` should return `""` (correct).
   
2. **Single Occurrence:**
   - Input: `func_1("a", "a")` should return `""` (correct).
   
3. **Multiple Occurrences:**
   - Input: `func_1("aaa", "a")` should return `"a"` (correctly removes the first and last).
   
4. **Character not in String:**
   - Input: `func_1("hello", "x")` should return `"hello"` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly fulfills the problem description for all identified edge cases. The output hints also align with the expected behavior of the code.

Thus, there are no found cases where the program does not perform as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
