The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed if it appears once, or with all occurrences of `char` removed if it appears multiple times. If `char` is not present, it returns the string `s` unchanged. The function correctly identifies and handles cases where `char` does not exist in `s`, appears once, or appears multiple times.
