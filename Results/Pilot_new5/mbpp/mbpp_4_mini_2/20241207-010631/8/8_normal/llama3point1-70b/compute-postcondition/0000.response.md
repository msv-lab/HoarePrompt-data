`first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `find` returns -1. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible value of `first_occurrence` based on the presence of `char` in `s`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.**
