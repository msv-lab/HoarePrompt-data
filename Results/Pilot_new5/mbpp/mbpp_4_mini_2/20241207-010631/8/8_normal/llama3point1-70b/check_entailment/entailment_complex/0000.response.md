To verify the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the program's logic.

### Problem Description:
The function must remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Single Occurrence Case**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it indicates that `char` appears only once in the string. The program correctly removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

3. **Multiple Occurrences Case**:
   - If `char` appears multiple times (i.e., `first_occurrence != last_occurrence`), the program constructs a new string that excludes both the first and last occurrences. It does this by concatenating three parts of the string:
     - The part before the first occurrence.
     - The part between the first and last occurrences (which does not include the first occurrence).
     - The part after the last occurrence.

4. **Character Not Present**:
   - If `char` is not found in the string (`first_occurrence == -1`), it simply returns the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character and handles:
- The case where it appears only once by removing that single occurrence.
- The case where it appears multiple times by removing both the first and last occurrences.
- The case where the character does not exist in the string by returning the original string unchanged.

### Final Decision:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
