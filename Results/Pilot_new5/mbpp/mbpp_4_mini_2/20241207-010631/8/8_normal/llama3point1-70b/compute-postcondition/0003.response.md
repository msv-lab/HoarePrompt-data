Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. Both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal to -1, indicating that `char` is found in `s`. The current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, meaning that `char` appears only once in `s`.***
