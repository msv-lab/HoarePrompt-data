The program provided does not correctly implement the requirement specified in the problem description. The requirement is to remove both the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. 

However, let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function identifies the index of the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
2. If the character is not found (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`) or if there is only one occurrence of the character (`first_index == last_index`), the function returns the original string `s`.
3. If there are multiple occurrences, it constructs a new string by removing the first occurrence and the last occurrence of `ch` using slicing.

The issue arises in the case where there are multiple occurrences of `ch` that are adjacent. For example, if we call `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`, the expected result should be an empty string because both the first and last occurrences of 'a' are the same character, but the current implementation would return 'aa', which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not satisfy the requirement of removing the first and last occurrences if they are the same character in a string with multiple occurrences.

Correctness: **False**
