The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the integer value 2. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `b`, which is the nth value of a specific sequence defined by the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return different values based on the value of `n`, while also generating a sequence for values of `n` greater than or equal to 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 2 if n is 0, returns 1 if n is 1, and returns the nth value of the sequence if n is greater than or equal to 2.**
