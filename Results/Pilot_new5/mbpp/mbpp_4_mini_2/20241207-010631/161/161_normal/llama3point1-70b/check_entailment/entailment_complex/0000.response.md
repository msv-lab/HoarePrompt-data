The annotated program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the n'th Lucas number.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Analyzing the provided code:
- The code correctly returns 2 for `n == 0` and 1 for `n == 1`, which aligns with the Lucas number definitions.
- However, in the else block for `n >= 2`, the loop is calculating the Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers. The correct recurrence relation for Lucas numbers is not being followed. The code initializes `a` as 2 and `b` as 1 and then uses the relation `a, b = b, a + b`, which corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence.

Therefore, for any `n >= 2`, the code will return the Fibonacci number instead of the Lucas number. This is a clear deviation from the problem description.

In conclusion, since the program deviates from the requirement to compute the Lucas numbers (specifically for values of `n >= 2`), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
