According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. Since the loop variable `_` is currently 3, the next value of `_` will be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 (since the loop will iterate while `_` is less than or equal to `n`). 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `_` is 3. To execute one more iteration, `_` will be incremented to 4, and thus `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, the loop variable `_` will be 4**
