Let's break down the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, starting with 2 and 1. The subsequent numbers in the sequence are the sum of the two preceding numbers.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns:
- 2 if `n` is 0
- 1 if `n` is 1
- the n-th Fibonacci number if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly returns 2 for `n == 0` and 1 for `n == 1`, which matches the Lucas sequence definition.
2. **Recursive Cases**: The loop computes the n-th term using the iterative approach. However, the program is supposed to return the n-th Lucas number, not the Fibonacci number.

### Edge Cases:
The code is supposed to return Lucas numbers, but the output hints incorrectly describe that it returns the n-th Fibonacci number instead. This indicates a mismatch between what the problem description asks and what the hints suggest.

### Discrepancy with Output Hints:
- The function does not return the n-th Fibonacci number for `n >= 2`, as the hint suggests, but instead correctly computes the n-th Lucas number. 

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the code does follow the problem description correctly by calculating the n-th Lucas number. However, the output hints incorrectly state that it returns the n-th Fibonacci number for `n >= 2`, which is misleading.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for calculating Lucas numbers for all valid non-negative integers n (0 and above), yet the output hints are misleading, it shows that the program fundamentally follows the problem description for the intended task.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all possible non-negative integer inputs according to the problem description.
