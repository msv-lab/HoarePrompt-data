According to the code, the loop iterates from 2 to `n + 1`. This means it will execute when `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be increased by 1, thus it will become 4. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 3, `_` is 4**
