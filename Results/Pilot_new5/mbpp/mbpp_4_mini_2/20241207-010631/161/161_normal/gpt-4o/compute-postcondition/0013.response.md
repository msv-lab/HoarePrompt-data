To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop and its effect on the variables `a` and `b`. 

The loop executes from 2 to `n`, which means it iterates `n - 1` times in total. The variables `a` and `b` evolve through the loop based on the Fibonacci-like sequence defined by the line `a, b = b, a + b`.

Starting values before the loop:
- `a` is initialized to 2.
- `b` is initialized to 1.

After analyzing the iterations:
- After 1 iteration (when `_` is 2):
  - New `a` becomes `b` (which is 1).
  - New `b` becomes `a + b` (which is 2 + 1 = 3).
  
- After 2 iterations (when `_` is 3):
  - New `a` becomes `b` (which is 3).
  - New `b` becomes `a + b` (which is 1 + 3 = 4).
  
- After 3 iterations (when `_` is 4):
  - New `a` becomes `b` (which is 4).
  - New `b` becomes `a + b` (which is 3 + 4 = 7).

Continuing this process, we find that:
- After `n - 1` iterations, the final values will be determined based on the Fibonacci-like progression originating from the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Specifically, after `n - 1` iterations:
- `a` will be the value of `b` after `n - 1` iterations.
- `b` will be the sum of the two values of `a` and `b` from the previous iteration.

Considering this, the final values of `a` and `b` can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci sequence:
- The output state after the loop has executed all iterations will depend on the value of `n`.

Given that `n` is at least 2 (since it's greater than 1), the final state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number starting from 1, `b` is the n-th Fibonacci number starting from 1.**
