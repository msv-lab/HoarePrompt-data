After executing the code snippet `a, b = b, a + b`, we need to determine the new values of `a` and `b` based on their initial values. 

1. Initially, `a` is 4 and `b` is 3.
2. The assignment `a, b = b, a + b` means:
   - The new value of `a` will be the old value of `b`, which is 3.
   - The new value of `b` will be the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is `4 + 3 = 7`.

Thus, after the execution:
- `a` becomes 3
- `b` becomes 7

The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `a` is 3; `b` is 7; `_` is 4**.
