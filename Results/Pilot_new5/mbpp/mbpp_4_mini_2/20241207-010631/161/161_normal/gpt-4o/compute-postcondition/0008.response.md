The values of `a` and `b` are swapped according to the expression `a, b = b, a + b`. The previous value of `a` is 2 and the previous value of `b` is 1. 

- The new value of `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` plus the previous value of `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.
- The new value of `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, which is `1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values are updated as follows: `a` is now 1 and `b` is now 3. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
