According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop range is from 2 to `n + 1`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than 0 and not equal to 1, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 2.

At the start of the loop, `_` will take on the values starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. The current state lists `n` as a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, which implies that `n` is at least 2. Therefore, the loop can execute as the range will yield at least one valid iteration.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is at least 2 (which is already satisfied), and `_` will start at 2.

Thus, the final state before the loop starts should reflect that `_` is 2 (the first value in the loop range).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2**
