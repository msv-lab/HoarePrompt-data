According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `n`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, it means `n` could be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. In order for the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `_` to be 3). Therefore, we adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
