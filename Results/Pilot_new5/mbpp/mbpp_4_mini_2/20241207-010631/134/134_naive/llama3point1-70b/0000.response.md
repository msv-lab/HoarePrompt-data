Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. Specifically, it uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the binomial coefficient for each index `i` from `0` to `n`, and it accumulates the sum only for those indices that are even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). This adheres to the problem description, which specifies finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would make the function fail to meet the requirements set out in the problem description. For instance:

- If `n = 0`, the function correctly computes `math.comb(0, 0)` which equals `1`, and since `0` is even, the result is `1`.
- If `n = 1`, it computes `math.comb(1, 0)` and `math.comb(1, 1)`, summing only the first one (which is `1`), resulting in `1`.
- If `n = 2`, it sums `math.comb(2, 0)` and `math.comb(2, 2)`, which are both `1`, yielding a correct result of `2`.

Thus, all tested scenarios and edge cases confirm the program's correctness for the given description.
