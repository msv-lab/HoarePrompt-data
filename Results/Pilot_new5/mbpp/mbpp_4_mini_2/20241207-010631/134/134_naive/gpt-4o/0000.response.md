To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we first need to analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description**: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

**Program**:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

**Analysis**:
The program defines a function `func_1(n)` which returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. The assertions check that the function returns specific values for inputs 4, 6, and 2.

In the context of binomial coefficients, the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n` can be expressed as:
- For `n = 4`: The binomial coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. The even-indexed coefficients are 1 (index 0), 6 (index 2), and 1 (index 4). Their sum is 1 + 6 + 1 = 8, which matches the assertion.
- For `n = 6`: The binomial coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The even-indexed coefficients are 1 (index 0), 15 (index 2), and 15 (index 4), and their sum is 1 + 15 + 15 = 31, not matching the assertion that it should be 32.
- For `n = 2`: The binomial coefficients are 1, 2, 1. The even-indexed coefficients are 1 (index 0) and 1 (index 2), and their sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the assertion.

The error lies in the second assertion for `n = 6`. The function does not correctly compute the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for this input. Thus, while it correctly handles the cases for `n = 4` and `n = 2`, it fails for `n = 6`.

**Conclusion**:
The program does not follow the problem description for the case when `n = 6`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **False**.
