According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive), thus for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n`. Currently, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, the last value of `i` that allows the loop to execute again is `i = 1` (which is the current state). After this iteration, `i` will increment by 1 for the next loop iteration.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must become 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to 1 when `i` is odd, and when `i` is even, `sum` is updated to `1 + n`, while `i` is 2.**
