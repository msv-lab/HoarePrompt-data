According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n + 1` times, which will include the indices from `0` to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, this means the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be `n`, and the variable `sum` remains `0` as stated.

For the loop to be executed:
- `n` is already a positive integer, ensuring that `n + 1` is at least `2`.
- The initial value of `i` will start at `0` and will increment with each iteration up to `n`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `0`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
