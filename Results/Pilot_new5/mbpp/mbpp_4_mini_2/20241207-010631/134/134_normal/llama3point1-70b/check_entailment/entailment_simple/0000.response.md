Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer `n`, which aligns with the requirement of taking a positive integer as input.

2. **Even Index Binomial Coefficients**: The program iterates through all integers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`). This correctly identifies even indices.

3. **Sum Calculation**: For each even index, the program computes the binomial coefficient using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the variable `sum`. This step accurately calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed sum, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

The logic and implementation directly match the problem requirements, ensuring that for any positive integer input `n`, the function will return the correct sum of the even index binomial coefficients from the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`. 

Thus, the program is correct and fulfills the problem description.
