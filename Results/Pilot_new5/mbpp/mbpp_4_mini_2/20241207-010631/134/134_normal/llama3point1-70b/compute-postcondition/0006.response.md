The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The value of `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, which is equal to `n! / (i! * (n - i)!)`. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to `n` since `math.comb(n, 1) = n`. Therefore, the updated value of `sum` will be `1 + n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
