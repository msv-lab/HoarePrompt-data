The program is not correct based on the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. However, the provided function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not correspond to the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

To clarify, the even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` are the coefficients from the expansion of `(1 + x)^n` that correspond to even powers of `x`, which can be computed using the binomial theorem or combinatorial methods. The sum of even index binomial coefficients is actually equal to `2^(n-1)` when computed correctly, but the program does not explicitly justify that it is calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Instead, it directly computes a power of 2 without any mention of binomial coefficients.

For instance, when `n = 4`, the even index binomial coefficients are `C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) + C(4, 4) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8`, which matches the output of `func_1(4)`, but this is purely coincidental since the calculation is not derived from the problem description.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the required logic according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
