The provided problem description requires a function to take a positive integer \( n \) and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The program provided is as follows:

```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1(n)` returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \). This result does not directly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients. For example, the binomial coefficients for \( n = 4 \) are \( C(4, 0) = 1 \), \( C(4, 2) = 6 \), and \( C(4, 4) = 1 \). The sum of even index coefficients would be \( 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \), which matches the assertion for \( func_1(4) \).

However, the same logic does not apply for larger \( n \). The sum of even index coefficients for \( n = 6 \) gives \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) + C(6, 6) = 1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32 \), which matches the assertion for \( func_1(6) \).

### Edge Cases:
The function appears to work correctly for the provided cases, but it is crucial to confirm if it works for all positive integers. The formula \( 2^{(n-1)} \) does indeed represent the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for the cases checked, but we must consider if this is a universally accurate approach for all positive integers. 

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function correctly computes the value based on the input \( n \), and they claim there are no edge cases or missing functionality. They state that the function returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for positive integers, which directly aligns with the output of the function. However, while the hints affirm the correctness of the code, they do not address the original problem's request to compute the "sum of even index binomial coefficients," which could imply a need for deeper verification.

### Conclusion:
The function seems to meet the problem's requirements in the provided cases. However, since it relies on the formula \( 2^{(n-1)} \) without explicitly calculating the even index binomial coefficients, there is potential for misunderstanding or misapplication if the problem were altered or if different interpretations arise.

Thus, although it appears to work for the given cases, it does not directly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients as specified, which leads to the conclusion that it does not satisfy the problem description fully.

Correctness: **False**. 
The code does not compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients directly as stated in the problem description, even though it might coincidentally work in the examples provided.
