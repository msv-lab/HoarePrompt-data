Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty string. According to the problem description, it is implied that the function should check whether all characters are the same. However, when given an empty string, the function returns `True`, which does not align with the expectation that there are no characters to compare. Therefore, if we consider the case of an empty string, the output is incorrect. 

For example:
- `func_1('')` should logically return `False` because there are no characters to be the same, yet the program returns `True`. 

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
