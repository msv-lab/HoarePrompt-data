To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I'll analyze the function and see if it successfully checks whether all characters in a string are the same.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that checks if all characters in a string are the same.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
2. The expression `set(s)` creates a set of characters from the string `s`. A set will contain only unique characters.
3. The function checks the length of this set. If the length is `1`, it means all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, they are not.

### Edge Cases:
- If the input string is empty (`s = ""`), the set will be empty, hence `len(set(s))` will be `0`, and the function will return `False`. According to the problem description, an empty string could be interpreted as "not all characters are the same" since there are no characters present.
- If the input string contains only one character (e.g., `s = "a"`), the function will return `True`, which is correct since all characters are indeed the same.
- For strings with two or more characters (e.g., `s = "aa"` or `s = "ab"`), the function will return as expected based on whether all characters are the same or not.

### Conclusion:
The function incorrectly handles the case of an empty string. According to most interpretations of "all characters are the same," an empty input should ideally return `True` (since there are no differing characters). However, the provided function returns `False` for the empty string, making it not adhere to the expected behavior.

Correctness: **False**  
The program does not handle the edge case of an empty string properly, as it returns `False` instead of `True`.
