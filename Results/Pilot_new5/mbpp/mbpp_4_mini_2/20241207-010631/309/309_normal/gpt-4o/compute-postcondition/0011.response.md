According to the code, the loop iterates through each character in the string `s`. Since `s` has a length greater than 1, it contains at least two characters. At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in the string.

If `char` is equal to `first_char`, the loop continues, and `char` will be updated to the next character in `s`. Since `s` has a length greater than 1, we can infer that the loop will move to the third character in `s` for the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `s` must still have characters left after the second character, and `char` must be updated to the next character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string with a length greater than 2, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character in `s`**
