Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(s)` that checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same.

Here's how the function works:

1. It converts the string `s` into a set using `set(s)`. A set in Python automatically removes duplicate elements, which means that if all characters in `s` are the same, the set will contain only one unique element.

2. The function then checks the length of this set. If the length is `1`, it indicates that all characters in the string are the same, hence the function returns `True`. If the length is greater than `1`, it returns `False`, indicating that there is at least one different character in the string.

The function handles strings of any length (as long as there is at least one character, as specified in the state of the program) and correctly returns the expected result based on the uniformity of characters in the string. Therefore, it meets all requirements laid out in the problem description.
