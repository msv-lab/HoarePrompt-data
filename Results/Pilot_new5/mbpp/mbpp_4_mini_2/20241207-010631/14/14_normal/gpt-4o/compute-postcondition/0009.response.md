The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. The initial state indicates that `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`, and it also states that `seen` contains the first integer in `arr`. 

Since `num` can either already be in `seen` or not, the only change that occurs is the addition of `num` to the set `seen`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Thus, after executing the code, the output state is updated to reflect that `seen` now contains the first integer from `arr` and also `num` (which is the second integer in `arr`).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr` and `num`**.
