The state of the variable `seen` is updated to include `num`. Since `num` is already in `seen`, the `seen` set will now include three integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third integer in `arr`, and `seen` is a set containing the first, second integers in `arr`, and `num` which is now added to the set `seen`.**
