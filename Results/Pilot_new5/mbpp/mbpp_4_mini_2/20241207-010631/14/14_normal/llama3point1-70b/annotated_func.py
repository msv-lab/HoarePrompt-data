#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether there are duplicate integers in the list 'arr', as it compares the length of 'arr' to the length of the set of 'arr' (which removes duplicates).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns False. It effectively checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from that list, which removes duplicates. It handles empty lists correctly, returning False when there are no elements.
