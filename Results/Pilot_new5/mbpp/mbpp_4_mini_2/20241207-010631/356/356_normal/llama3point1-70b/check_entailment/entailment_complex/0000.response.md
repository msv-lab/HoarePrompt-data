Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `input_str` as an argument. The function uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters specifically the space character (' ').

Hereâ€™s why it correctly fulfills the problem description:

1. **Whitespace Removal**: The function replaces all instances of the space character (' ') in the input string with an empty string (''). This effectively removes all spaces from the string.

2. **Handling of Different Cases**: The function handles any string input, including those with leading spaces, trailing spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces. For instance:
   - Input: `"  Hello   World  "` would return `"HelloWorld"` as all spaces are removed.
   - Input: `"NoSpaces"` would return `"NoSpaces"` as there are no spaces to remove.
   - Input: `"Leading space"` would return `"Leadingspace"`.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new string without altering the original input string, which is a typical requirement in string manipulation tasks.

Thus, the program adheres to the specifications of the problem description by accurately removing whitespace from the input string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
