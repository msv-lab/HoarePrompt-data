Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. The function `func_1(s)` uses the `replace` method to substitute each space character (`' '`) with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them. 

The provided assertions cover various cases, including:
- A string with single spaces between words.
- A string with multiple spaces between words.
- A string with leading spaces.

In all these cases, the output matches the expected results as defined in the problem description.

Additionally, I've considered potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty string, which would return an empty string as expected.
- A string with no spaces, which would return the string unchanged.

Since the function behaves correctly in all tested and potential scenarios, the program fulfills the problem's requirements.
