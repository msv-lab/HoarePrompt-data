Correctness: **False**

The provided program only replaces spaces (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing only space characters from the input string. However, the problem description requires removing all whitespaces, which include not only spaces but also tabs, newlines, and other whitespace characters.

For example, consider the input string:

```python
input_str = "Hello\tWorld\n"
```

In this case, the program will return:

```python
"HelloWorld\n"
```

This output is incorrect because it fails to remove the tab ('\t') and newline ('\n') characters, which are also considered whitespace.

Thus, the code does not meet the requirement of the problem description to remove all types of whitespace, not just spaces.
