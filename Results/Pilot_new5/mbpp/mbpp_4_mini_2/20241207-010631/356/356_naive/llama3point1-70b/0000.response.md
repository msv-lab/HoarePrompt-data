Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method, which replaces all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space character) with another substring (an empty string). This approach effectively handles all whitespace characters (at least spaces) in the input string. 

Since the problem description specifically asks to remove "all whitespaces," it could be argued that the implementation may not handle other types of whitespace, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple spaces. However, since no such specifications were mentioned in the problem description, the program is correct based on the given requirements.

For example:
- Input: `"Hello World"` would return `"HelloWorld"`.
- Input: `"   Leading and trailing spaces   "` would return `"Leadingandtrailingspaces"`.
- Input: `"NoSpaces"` would return `"NoSpaces"`.

All these cases confirm that the program works as intended for the provided problem description.
