Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to check whether a given month number (1 to 12) contains 30 days. However, it fails to account for the following cases:

1. It returns `False` for month `2`, which is indeed not a month with 30 days, but it also does not handle the fact that February can have 28 or 29 days in leap years.
2. It incorrectly returns `False` for months `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `10`, and `12`, which all have either 31 days or fewer than 30 days.

Additionally, the assertion for month `12` (`assert func_1(12) == False`) is also incorrect, as December has 31 days.

Given these issues, the function does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
