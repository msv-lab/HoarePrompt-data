Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(month)` checks whether the given `month` (which is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive) corresponds to any month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days are represented by the integers 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November).

2. **Return Values**: The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. The expression `month in thirty_days_months` evaluates to `True` if `month` is one of those integers, meaning it correctly returns `True` for the months with 30 days. Conversely, for any other month (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), it returns `False`, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

3. **Assumption Handling**: The problem description states that the input will always be an integer between 1 and 12. The program has been designed with the assumption that the input will be valid, thus it does not require additional error handling for out-of-bounds input, which is acceptable based on the given conditions.

Overall, the function correctly identifies the months with 30 days and provides appropriate return values for all valid inputs, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
