The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that combines `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and return a new list that includes all elements from both structures. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that combines `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple` converted into a list.**
