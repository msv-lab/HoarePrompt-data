The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `tpl` is a tuple of elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines the elements of both. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted into a list.**
