#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and tpl is a tuple of elements.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of 'lst' and 'tpl' converted into a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted into a list. It does not handle any edge cases related to the types of elements in the list or tuple, assuming they are compatible for concatenation.
