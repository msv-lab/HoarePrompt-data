Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to add the elements of a given tuple to a list. It correctly implements this functionality by converting the tuple into a list and using the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists. 

The assertions provided test various scenarios:
1. Adding a tuple `(9, 10)` to the list `[5, 6, 7]`, which correctly results in `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. Adding a tuple `(10, 11)` to the list `[6, 7, 8]`, which correctly results in `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. Adding a tuple `(11, 12)` to the list `[7, 8, 9]`, which correctly results in `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

The function handles all cases correctly and does not miss any edge cases based on the problem description. The conversion of the tuple to a list ensures that all elements are added correctly, regardless of the tuple's size or contents.

Thus, there are no potential cases where the function does not behave as expected given the problem description.
