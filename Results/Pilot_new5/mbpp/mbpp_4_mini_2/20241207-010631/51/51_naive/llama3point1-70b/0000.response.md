Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list `numbers` is empty. When the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be `0`, leading to division by zero when the program attempts to compute `product / len(numbers)`. This will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`, indicating that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
