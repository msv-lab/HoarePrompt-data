To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it meets the requirements.

The problem description states that we need to "multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list."

Let's break down the provided function:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

1. The function initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying them together.
3. Finally, it divides the total product by the length of the list and returns that value.

Now, we need to consider potential edge cases:

- If the input list is empty (`[]`), the function will attempt to divide `product` (which is 1) by `len(numbers)` (which is 0). This will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If the input list contains any zeroes (e.g., `[0, 1, 2]`), the product will be 0, which is valid, but the division will still proceed as normal since the length is valid.
- If the input list contains negative numbers, the product will be negative, and the division will still work as expected.

The key issue here is the empty list scenario. This case is not handled in the code, which leads to a runtime error.

Given this analysis, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly when the list is empty.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails when given an empty list as input, resulting in a division by zero error.
