The variable `product` is assigned the value of `product *= num`, which means it is multiplied by the current value of `num`. The variable `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`. The value of `product` will change based on its previous value and the value of `num`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, and `product` is now equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `product` is equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by `num`.**
