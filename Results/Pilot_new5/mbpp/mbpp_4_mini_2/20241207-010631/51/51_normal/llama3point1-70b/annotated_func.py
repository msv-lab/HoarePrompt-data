#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least one element, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, and `num` is the last element of `numbers`.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of the numbers in the list 'numbers', calculated as the product of all elements in 'numbers' divided by the length of 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats) and returns the average of the numbers, calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. However, this approach is incorrect for calculating an average, as it multiplies all numbers instead of summing them. Additionally, if the list contains a zero, the function will return zero since the product will be zero, which may not be a valid average in context.
