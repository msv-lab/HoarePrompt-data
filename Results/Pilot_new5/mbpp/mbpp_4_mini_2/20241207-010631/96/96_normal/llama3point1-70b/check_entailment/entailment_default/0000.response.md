To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the problem description alongside the source code.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type or not.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function creates a set of the types of each element in the tuple (`tup`).
2. It checks if the length of this set is equal to 1, which would indicate that all the elements are of the same type.

### Edge Cases:
- The function does not handle the case of an empty tuple. According to the logic, an empty tuple would yield an empty set, resulting in a length of 0. Thus, it would return `False`, which contradicts the logical expectation that it should return `True` since there are no differing types.
- For a tuple with one element, the function would correctly return `True` as expected since there is only one type present.

### Output Hints:
- The output hints state that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same data type and `False` if they are not. It further mentions that the function does not handle the empty tuple case, but logically should return `True`.

The output hints agree with the code in terms of outlining its intended function. However, they highlight a significant edge case: the empty tuple should ideally return `True`, but the current implementation returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it fails to handle the empty tuple case correctly, even though the hints state it should logically return `True`. Hence, since the implementation does not adhere to the expected behavior for all scenarios detailed in the problem description, the assessment of the codeâ€™s correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not return the correct output for the empty tuple case, which is a valid and potential input according to the problem description.
