Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description. While the function attempts to check if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type, it has a flaw in its logic concerning empty tuples and tuples with a single element.

1. **Handling of Empty Tuples**: According to the problem description, the function should return `False` for an empty tuple since there are no elements to compare types. However, the current implementation returns `True` for an empty tuple, which does not meet the requirements.

2. **Handling of Tuples with One Element**: The logic implicitly handles tuples with a single element by returning `True`, which is not explicitly covered in the initial description. The problem description does not state that a single-element tuple should be considered as having the same type, but this is a more ambiguous case that could lead to confusion.

Thus, the function fails to correctly account for these edge cases, meaning it does not always behave according to the problem description. The function needs to be adjusted to return `False` for empty tuples to be correct.
