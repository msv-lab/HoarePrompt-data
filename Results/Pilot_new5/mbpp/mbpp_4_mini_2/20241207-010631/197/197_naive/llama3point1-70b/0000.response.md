Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the occurrence of all elements from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`. It utilizes a generator expression to iterate through each element in `lst`, counting how many times that element appears in `tup` using the `count` method. The sum of these counts is then returned, which matches the requirement of the problem description. 

For example:
- If `tup = (1, 2, 3, 1)` and `lst = [1, 2]`, it correctly counts `1` occurring twice and `2` occurring once, returning a total of `3`.
- If `tup = ()` (an empty tuple) and `lst = [1, 2]`, the function would return `0`, which is also the expected outcome.

Thus, the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
