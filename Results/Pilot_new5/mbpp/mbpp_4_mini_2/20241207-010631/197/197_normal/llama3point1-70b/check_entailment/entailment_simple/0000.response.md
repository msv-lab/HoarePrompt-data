Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The task is to count the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple, but the program currently sums up the counts of each element found in the list instead of returning a count of occurrences for each individual element.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 1, 3)` and `lst = [1, 2]`, the expected output should be a count of occurrences for each element in the list, which would be `{1: 2, 2: 1}`. However, the program returns `3`, which is the sum of occurrences of all elements from the list found in the tuple (2 from 1 and 1 from 2).

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of counting occurrences for each element specifically.
