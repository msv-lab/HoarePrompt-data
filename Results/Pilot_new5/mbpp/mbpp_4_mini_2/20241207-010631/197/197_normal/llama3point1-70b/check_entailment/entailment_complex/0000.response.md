Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrence of all elements from a list (`lst`) in a tuple (`tup`). This aligns directly with the problem description.

2. **Counting Mechanism**: The function uses a generator expression within `sum()` to iterate over each element in `lst` and calls `tup.count(element)` for each element. This effectively counts how many times each element of `lst` appears in `tup`.

3. **Handling Elements Not Found**: If an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` returns 0. Thus, the function correctly accounts for all elements in `lst`, even those that are not present in `tup`, as required by the problem description.

4. **Empty List Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle empty inputs, but it naturally returns 0 if `lst` is empty since there are no elements to count. This is a valid and expected outcome, adhering to the problem's requirements.

5. **Overall Output**: The function returns a single integer representing the total count of occurrences of all elements in `lst` within `tup`, which is precisely what was asked for in the problem description.

In conclusion, the program fulfills the problem's requirements for all potential cases, therefore it is correct.
