#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of the counts of each element in list 'lst' found in tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. This includes handling cases where `lst` may contain elements not present in `tup`, as they will contribute a count of 0. The function does not handle empty inputs explicitly but will return 0 if `lst` is empty, as there are no elements to count.
