Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` starting from the last index down to the first index. It checks if the current element is equal to the `target`. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that element, which is the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration. If no match is found after traversing the entire array, it returns -1. This logic correctly identifies the last position of the given element in a sorted array, fulfilling the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Additionally, edge cases such as an empty array or the target not being present in the array are handled correctly by returning -1 in those scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
