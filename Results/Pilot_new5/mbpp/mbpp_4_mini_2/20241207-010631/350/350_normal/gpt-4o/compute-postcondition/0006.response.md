Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that contains at least 2 integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`, no return occurs as there is no else part defined.***
