The provided code intends to find the last position of a specific element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The description states that the function should return the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or `-1` if `x` is not found.

Here's a breakdown of the provided code:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

1. The function iterates over the array in reverse, which is appropriate for finding the last occurrence of an element.
2. It checks each element from the end of the array to the start and returns the index of the first match it finds, ensuring it is the last occurrence since it is traversing from the end.
3. If no match is found, it correctly returns `-1`.

### Initial Assessment:
The given code appears to follow the problem description as it correctly identifies the last occurrence of `x` in a sorted array and returns the appropriate index or `-1` if the element is not found.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. If the array is empty. The function should return `-1`, which it does.
2. If `x` is not present in the array, the function should return `-1`, which is correctly handled.
3. If `x` occurs multiple times, it should return the last index, which the code does correctly.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function:
- Accepts a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Searches for the last occurrence of `x` and returns its index or `-1` if `x` is not found.

The hints align with the functionality of the code. The examples provided in the assertions are also consistent with the expected behavior of the function. For instance:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` correctly returns `0`.
- `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` correctly returns `2`.
- `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` correctly returns `3`.

### Conclusion:
Since the code correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately, I find no instances where it fails to meet the specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
