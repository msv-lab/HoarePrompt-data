Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x`, which is the integer we are searching for.

2. **Searching from the End**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through the array from the last index to the first. This ensures that when the target element `x` is found, it is the last occurrence since the loop starts from the end of the array.

3. **Returning the Index**: Upon finding the element `x`, the function immediately returns the index `i`, which is the last occurrence of `x` in the sorted list.

4. **Handling Element Not Found**: If the element `x` is not present in the array, the loop completes without finding it, and the function returns -1, which correctly indicates that the element is not found.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases:

- In the first case, searching for `1` in `[1, 2, 3]` correctly returns `0`, as `1` is found at index `0`.
- In the second case, searching for `1` in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` correctly returns `2`, as the last occurrence of `1` is at index `2`.
- In the third case, searching for `3` in `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` correctly returns `3`, as the last occurrence of `3` is at index `3`.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description and accurately finds the last position of the specified element in the sorted array.
