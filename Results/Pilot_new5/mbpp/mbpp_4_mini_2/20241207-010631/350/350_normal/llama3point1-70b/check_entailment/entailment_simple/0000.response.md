Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function (`func_1`) that finds the last position of an element (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Iterative Search from the End**: The function iterates over the array in reverse order (from the last index to the first) using a for loop, which is appropriate for finding the last occurrence of the target element.

2. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is equal to the `target`. If it finds a match, it returns the index `i`, which represents the last occurrence of that element since we are traversing the list backward.

3. **Return Value for Absence of Target**: If the target is not found after checking all elements, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target integer is not present in the list. This behavior is standard for search functions when an element is not found.

4. **Handles All Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the target may appear multiple times, returning the index of the last occurrence. It also correctly handles cases where the target is not present at all.

Therefore, the implementation adheres strictly to the requirements set forth in the problem description, ensuring that the last position of the target element in the sorted array is accurately identified.
