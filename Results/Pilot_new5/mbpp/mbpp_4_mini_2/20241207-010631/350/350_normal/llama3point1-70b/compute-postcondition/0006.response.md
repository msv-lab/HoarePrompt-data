Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, and `i` is the last index of `arr` (len(arr) - 2). If `arr[i]` is equal to `target`, the program returns the index `i`. Since the last element of `arr` at index `i` is not equal to `target`, no return occurs from this block.***
