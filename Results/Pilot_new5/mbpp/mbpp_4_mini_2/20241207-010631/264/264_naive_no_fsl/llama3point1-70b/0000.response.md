Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`. This is the standard formula used to perform the conversion, and it will accurately handle all inputs that are valid for the conversion from degrees to radians.

Additionally, the edge cases, such as converting 0 degrees (which should yield 0 radians) or negative degrees (which will yield a negative radian value), are also correctly handled by the program. The program will return the correct radian values for any degree input, as the mathematical operations involved will not lead to unexpected results.

Since no counterexamples can be found where this function fails to meet the problem description, the code is correct.
