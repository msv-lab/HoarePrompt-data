Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions for 90, 60, and 120 degrees return the correct expected results, which match the mathematical conversion from degrees to radians. 

Furthermore, the function handles any degree input correctly, including negative degrees and values greater than 360 degrees, since the formula applies universally. There is no case where the function fails to work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
