#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the angle in radians calculated as deg multiplied by π and divided by 180, where deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg`, representing an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `deg` by π and dividing by 180. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range of degrees, but it will compute the conversion for any numeric input.
