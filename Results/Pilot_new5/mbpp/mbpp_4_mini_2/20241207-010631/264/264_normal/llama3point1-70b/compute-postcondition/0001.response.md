The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, it returns the angle in radians calculated as `deg` multiplied by Ï€ and divided by 180. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and return its equivalent value in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg, representing an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians.**
