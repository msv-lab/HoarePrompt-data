The provided Python function `func_1` is intended to convert degrees to radians. The formula used in the function is correct: it converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by `(math.pi / 180)`.

Looking at the function, it takes a numeric input, which can include negative values and zero, and applies the conversion formula. Specifically:
- For 90 degrees, it correctly returns approximately 1.5708 radians.
- For 60 degrees, it returns approximately 1.0472 radians.
- For 120 degrees, it returns approximately 2.0944 radians.

Next, I will assess edge cases:
- The function will handle 0 degrees, which should return 0 radians correctly (since 0 * (math.pi / 180) = 0).
- Negative angles, such as -90 degrees, will also be handled correctly (resulting in -1.5708 radians).

Now, I will consider the output hints, which state that the function handles all numeric inputs, including negative values and zero, properly converting them to radians. This agrees with the logic of the function since it uses a straightforward mathematical formula that applies to all real numbers.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the function fails to follow the problem description and all provided examples show correct outputs, I conclude that the function is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
