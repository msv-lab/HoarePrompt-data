To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the function's logic and consider potential edge cases.

The function definition is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Problem Analysis
1. **Matrix Input**: The program expects a matrix, which is a list of lists.
2. **Column Index**: The parameter `n` is used to specify the column from which the maximum value should be extracted. It's important to note that it uses `n - 1` to access the column, which implies that the column index is 1-based.

### Potential Issues to Consider
1. **Empty Matrix**: If the input `matrix` is empty, attempting to find the maximum of an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`.
2. **Invalid Column Index**: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in the rows of the matrix, the function would again raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `row[n - 1]`.
3. **Non-Uniform Row Lengths**: If the rows in the matrix have different lengths, accessing `row[n - 1]` could lead to an `IndexError` for rows that are shorter than `n`.

### Conclusion
Given the above considerations, the function does not handle cases where:
- The matrix is empty.
- The column index `n` is out of bounds.
- The rows of the matrix have varying lengths.

Since the function fails to account for these potential edge cases, it does not fulfill the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False** 

**Explanation**: The program does not handle empty matrix cases or invalid column indices, which can lead to runtime errors when executed.
