To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the function `func_1(matrix, n)` and evaluate its behavior against the problem description, which states that the function should return the maximum value from the `n`-th column of a given matrix represented as a list of lists.

### Review of the Code:
The program contains the function `func_1(matrix, n)` which:
1. Extracts the `n`-th column from the provided `matrix`.
2. Returns the maximum value from that column.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Column Index Validity**: The function does not handle cases where `n` is out of the range of valid column indices. For example:
   - If `n` is negative or greater than the number of columns in the matrix, this will raise an `IndexError`.
   - Example input: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)` would fail because there is no 2nd index (0-based) in the provided matrix.
  
2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix provided is empty, `func_1([], 0)` would also raise an `IndexError` since there are no rows to extract a column from.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If the rows of the matrix are of inconsistent lengths, accessing `row[n]` could again lead to an `IndexError`. For instance:
   - Example input: `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 1)` would fail because the second row does not have a column at index 1.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle edge cases and can raise errors under certain conditions. As described above, the function can fail if the column index `n` is invalid or if the matrix is empty or irregularly shaped.

Correctness: **False** 

This determination is based on the fact that the function lacks error handling for various potential input scenarios that the problem description did not specify, leading to cases where the function would not perform as expected.
