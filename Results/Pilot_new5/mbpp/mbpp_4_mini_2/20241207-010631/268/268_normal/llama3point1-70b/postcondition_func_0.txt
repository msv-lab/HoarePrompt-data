The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix. If n is 0, it will result in an IndexError due to attempting to access an out-of-bounds index, as the (n-1)th column would not exist. The function does not handle this error, which is a potential edge case.
