#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix, where matrix is a list of lists and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix. If n is 0, it will result in an IndexError due to attempting to access an out-of-bounds index, as the (n-1)th column would not exist. The function does not handle this error, which is a potential edge case.
