You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix, where matrix is a list of lists and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix. If n is 0, it will result in an IndexError due to attempting to access an out-of-bounds index, as the (n-1)th column would not exist. The function does not handle this error, which is a potential edge case.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
