The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the `n`th column of the `matrix`. However, if `matrix` is empty or if `n` is out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row of `matrix`), it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `matrix` is not empty and that `n` is within the valid range before calling this function to avoid potential errors.
