Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' except at the start and end of each word. The function splits the input string into words and checks each word (with a length greater than 1) for the presence of 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters. 

All scenarios are handled properly:
1. Single-character words will not be checked, as they cannot have 'z' in the middle.
2. Words with 'z' at the start or end will not count, as the check explicitly looks in `word[1:-1]`.
3. Words without 'z' will naturally return False without any issues.

Thus, I see no edge cases or missed logic in the implementation, confirming that it meets the problem requirements.
