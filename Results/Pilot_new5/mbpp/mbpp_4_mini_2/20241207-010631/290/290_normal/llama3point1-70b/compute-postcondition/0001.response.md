According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. The loop will execute if `words` contains at least one element, meaning that the string `s` must not be empty. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `word` will take the value of the first element in the `words` list during the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `word` must be the first word in the list.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**
