Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It returns `True` if `n` is odd (when `n % 2` is not equal to 0) and `False` if `n` is even (when `n % 2` is equal to 0). This logic accurately follows the problem description for all potential integer inputs, such as negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. All cases have been accounted for, so the program is correct.
