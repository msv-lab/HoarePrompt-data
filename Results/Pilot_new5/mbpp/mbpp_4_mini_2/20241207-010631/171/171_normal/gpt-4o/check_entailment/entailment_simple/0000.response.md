Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the number `n` is odd by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2) and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., divisible by 2).

The assertions provided in the program also confirm its correctness:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct since 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct since 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct since 10 is even.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by properly identifying the parity of a number as odd or even for all tested cases. The logic is sound, and it handles the input as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
