Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` is defined to take a single integer argument `n`.

2. **Parity Check**: The key operation in the function is `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the number `n` is odd. The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of `n` by `2`. If `n` is odd, this operation will yield `1`, making the expression `n % 2 != 0` evaluate to `True`. Conversely, if `n` is even, `n % 2` will yield `0`, and the expression will evaluate to `False`.

3. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which aligns perfectly with the requirement of determining whether the parity of the number is odd.

4. **Overall Functionality**: The program's functionality, as explained in the annotations, accurately reflects the problem's requirements. It correctly interprets the parity of the integer and provides the expected boolean output.

Since all tests for both odd and even integers will yield the correct results, the program correctly implements the problem description.
