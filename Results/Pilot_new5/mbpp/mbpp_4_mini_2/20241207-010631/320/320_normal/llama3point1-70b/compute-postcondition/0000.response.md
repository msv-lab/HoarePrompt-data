The code creates a set from the `nums` list, which automatically removes any duplicate integers, and then converts it back into a list. As a result, `unique_nums` will contain only the unique elements from the original list `nums`. The state of `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list containing the unique integers from `nums`.**
