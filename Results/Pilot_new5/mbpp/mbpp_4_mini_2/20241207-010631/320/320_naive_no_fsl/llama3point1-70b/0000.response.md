Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by following these steps:

1. It first converts the list to a set to ensure all numbers are unique, eliminating duplicates.
2. It checks if there are fewer than two unique numbers. If so, it returns `None`, which is appropriate because there can't be a second smallest number.
3. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second element (the second smallest number).

This logic is sound and covers edge cases, such as:
- When the input list has only one unique number (it correctly returns `None`).
- When the input list is empty (it also returns `None`).
- When there are multiple duplicates of the smallest number (it still correctly identifies the second smallest).

Since all cases have been considered and function as expected, the program is correct.
