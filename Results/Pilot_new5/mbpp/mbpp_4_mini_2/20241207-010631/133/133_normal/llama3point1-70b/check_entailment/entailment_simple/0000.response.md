Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple from the corresponding elements of the second tuple using their indices.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes that both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, as stated in the precondition. This is a necessary condition for the element-wise subtraction to make sense.

2. **Element-wise Operation**: The program uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements from both tuples. It then iterates over these pairs (a, b) where `a` comes from `tup1` and `b` comes from `tup2`.

3. **Subtraction**: For each pair, it performs the subtraction `a - b`, which directly follows the requirement to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple based on their respective indices.

4. **Tuple Creation**: The results of the subtraction are collected into a new tuple using the `tuple()` constructor, which is the expected output format as per the problem description.

Since the function adheres to the specified behavior of taking two tuples and performing index-based subtraction, it fulfills the problem's requirements for all potential cases where the input tuples are of the same length and contain numeric values. Thus, the output of the function will always be correct for valid inputs.
