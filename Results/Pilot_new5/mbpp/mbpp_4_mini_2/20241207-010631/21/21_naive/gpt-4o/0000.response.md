Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This is correctly implemented, as the `min()` function will return the smallest value in the list provided. The assertions provided cover a few test cases, and since the `min()` function can handle various lists, including those with varying positive integers, it is reasonable to conclude that it will work for any valid list of numbers. 

The only potential edge case not explicitly covered in the assertions is an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, since the problem description does not mention handling empty lists, we can assume that the function is meant to operate on non-empty lists of numbers. Therefore, the program is considered correct given the problem description.
