Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(nums)` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`. The built-in `min()` function correctly handles various cases such as:

1. An empty list will raise a `ValueError`, which is consistent with the expectation that the input should be a non-empty list to find a smallest number.
2. A list with all identical elements will return that same element.
3. A list of mixed positive and negative integers will return the smallest integer correctly.

Since it correctly identifies the smallest number under typical conditions associated with finding a minimum in a list and the only edge case (an empty list) aligns with an expected behavior, the function meets the problem requirements comprehensively.
