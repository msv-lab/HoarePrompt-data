The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min()` function. 

Initial assessment:
- The function operates correctly for non-empty lists, returning the minimum value among the elements.
- However, it does not account for the case when the input list `nums` is empty. The built-in `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` in this case, which is not handled in the function.

Now, examining the output hints:
- The hints specify that the function accepts a list of numbers and returns the minimum value from that list, but it also notes that if the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError`. This aligns with the behavior of the `min()` function and confirms that the function does not handle the empty list case.

Since the problem description requires the function to find the smallest number in a list, it must handle all possible cases, including when the list is empty. Since the provided implementation does not handle this edge case and will raise an error instead, it does not fulfill the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not handle the case of an empty list, which leads to an exception being raised, thus failing to meet the problem description's requirements in every potential case.
