The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a given list. It uses Python's built-in `min` function to determine the minimum value among the elements of the list.

Initial assessment based solely on the problem description:
- The description states that the function should find the smallest number in a list. The code uses `min(lst)`, which correctly implements this functionality for non-empty lists.
- However, the problem description does not explicitly mention the requirement for the input list to be non-empty, which leads to potential issues if an empty list is passed as an argument. In such a case, invoking `min` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.

Now, examining the output hints:
- The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of numbers and returns the minimum value, but they also explicitly state that the function does not handle empty lists, which will raise an error. This aligns with the initial assessment indicating that the function does not account for all possible cases described in the problem.

Given that the program does not handle the edge case of an empty list, which is a valid input scenario according to typical behavior in list processing, the code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not work correctly when an empty list is provided as input, as it will raise a ValueError, failing to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases.
