Correctness: **True**

The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It uses the built-in `min()` function to return the smallest number from that list.
3. The assertions provided test the function with several cases:
   - For the input `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the smallest number is `1`, and the assertion checks that the output is correct.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is `1`, which is also correctly asserted.
   - For the input `[45, 46, 50, 60]`, the smallest number is `45`, and this is correctly captured by the assertion.

Since the function consistently produces the correct result for the provided test cases, it adheres to the problem description of finding the smallest number in a list. The use of `min()` is appropriate as it directly finds the minimum value, ensuring that the function works as intended for any list of numbers. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
