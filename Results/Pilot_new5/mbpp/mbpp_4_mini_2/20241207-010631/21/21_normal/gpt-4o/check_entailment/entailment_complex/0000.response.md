Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle the case where the input list `lst` is empty. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to find the smallest number in a list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the minimum, which does not align with the expectation that the function should always return a valid minimum number from the list.

Therefore, while the function works correctly for non-empty lists, it fails to fulfill the requirement for all potential inputs, specifically when an empty list is provided. This makes the program incorrect in the context of the problem description.
