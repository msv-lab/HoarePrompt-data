Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. 

Here are a few example cases to confirm the correctness:

1. For an input `[['banana', 'Apple', 'cherry']]`, the output would be `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]`.
2. For an input `[[], ['dog', 'Cat', 'elephant']]`, the output would be `[[], ['Cat', 'dog', 'elephant']]`.

Since the function handles empty sublists, mixed-case strings, and will sort any given valid list of lists of strings correctly, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. Thus, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
