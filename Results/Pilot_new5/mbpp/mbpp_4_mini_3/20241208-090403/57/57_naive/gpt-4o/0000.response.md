Correctness: **False**.

The program does not properly handle the case where the strings in the sublists have leading or trailing whitespace. The examples provided in the problem description suggest that the sorting should disregard leading and trailing spaces. However, the `sorted` function in Python sorts based on the exact string values, including spaces. 

For example, in the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`, the expected output according to the problem description suggests that ' black' should come before 'blue ', but due to the leading space in ' black', the sorting will put ' blue ' before ' black'. Thus, the output will not match the requirements of the problem description. 

Another example is `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, where the expected output indicates that 'black' and 'white' should be ordered correctly within the sublist, but the program does not ensure that the strings are stripped of spaces before sorting. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements in all potential cases.
