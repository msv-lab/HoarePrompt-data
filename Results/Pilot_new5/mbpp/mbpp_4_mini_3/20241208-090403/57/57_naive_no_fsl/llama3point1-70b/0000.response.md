Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description by defining a function that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The use of `sorted` with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, which is the expected behavior when sorting strings. 

I can confirm the correctness of the program through the following reasoning:

1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (`[]`), it will return an empty list. This is the expected behavior since there are no sublists to sort.

2. **Single Sublist**: For an input like `[["banana", "apple", "Cherry"]]`, the output will be `[['apple', 'banana', 'Cherry']]`, which is correctly sorted.

3. **Multiple Sublists**: For an input like `[["banana", "apple"], ["Cherry", "banana"]]`, the output will be `[['apple', 'banana'], ['banana', 'Cherry']]`, which correctly sorts each sublist.

4. **Case Sensitivity**: The sorting is case-insensitive, meaning both `['a', 'B', 'c']` will sort into `['a', 'B', 'c']`, which is the expected outcome.

5. **Mixed Cases**: The program handles mixed case strings correctly, e.g., for `[['apple', 'Banana', 'cherry']]`, it will return `[['Banana', 'apple', 'cherry']]`.

Since the program handles all these potential cases correctly according to the problem description, I conclude that the code meets the requirements specified.
