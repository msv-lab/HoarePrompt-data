The provided code defines a function `func_1` that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The approach uses a list comprehension combined with the `sorted()` function, which is generally a valid method for sorting lists in Python.

### Initial Assessment
1. **Functionality**: The function appears to sort each sublist correctly. For instance:
   - `['green', 'orange']` stays the same since it's already sorted.
   - `['black', 'white']` remains unchanged.
   - `['white', 'black', 'orange']` becomes `['black', 'orange', 'white']` after sorting, which matches the expected behavior.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: However, we need to analyze potential edge cases:
   - If the input list is empty, `func_1([])` would return `[]`, which is correct as it matches the expected behavior of returning an empty list when there is nothing to sort.
   - If the input contains non-list elements or a mix of types (for instance, `[['red'], 'blue', ['green']]`), it would raise a TypeError since `sorted()` expects a list and would attempt to sort a string.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-list elements. This aligns with our findings because while the function does handle empty lists correctly, it does not have any error handling for cases where the input is malformed (i.e., non-list sub-elements).

### Conclusion
Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically it lacks error handling for non-list inputs), it is considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle cases where the input may contain non-list elements, leading to a possible runtime error.
