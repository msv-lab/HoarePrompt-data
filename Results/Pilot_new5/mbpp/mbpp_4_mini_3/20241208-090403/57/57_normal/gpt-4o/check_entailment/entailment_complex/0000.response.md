The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists containing strings and sorts each sublist in ascending order. The assertions given as tests seem to check this behavior.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` implements the behavior described in the problem statementâ€”sorting each sublist of strings. This means that for any given input of lists of strings, the output will be a new list of lists with each sublist sorted.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided check various cases:
   - The first assertion checks if the sublists `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['white', 'black', 'orange']` are sorted correctly. The expected result is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which indicates that the sorting is not applied correctly (the third sublist is not sorted).
   - The second assertion checks the sorting of `[' red ', 'green']`, `['blue ', ' black']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']`. The expected result is `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which also indicates incorrect sorting (the second sublist is not sorted).
   - The third assertion has the input `['zilver', 'gold']`, `['magnesium', 'aluminium']`, and `['steel', 'bronze']`, and the expected result is `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. The output does not match the expected results in the way sorting should occur.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code acknowledges that it does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-list elements. While the prompt does not specify that these edge cases should be handled, it implies that the function should still work correctly for the intended input types.

Based on the analysis of the assertions and the behavior of the function:

- The function does not produce the expected outputs for the provided test cases. Specifically, the ordering of the strings is incorrect in the assertions provided.
  
Thus, we conclude that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
