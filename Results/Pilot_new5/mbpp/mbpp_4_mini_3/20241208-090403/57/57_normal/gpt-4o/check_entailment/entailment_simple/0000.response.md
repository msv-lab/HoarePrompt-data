To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements and the implementation. 

### Problem Description:
The function must sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
1. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`, calling the `sorted()` function on each sublist.
3. The `sorted()` function returns a new list that contains the elements of the sublist sorted in ascending order. This is also consistent with the requirement to sort the strings in each sublist.
4. The function then returns a new list of sorted sublists.

### Test Cases:
- The test cases provided as assertions check whether the output of `func_1` matches the expected sorted lists.
- Let's analyze each assertion:
  - For `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, the correct sorted sublists would be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. 
  - For `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`, the correct sorted sublists are `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`.
  - For `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])`, the correct sorted sublists are `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

### Conclusion:
All provided test cases demonstrate that the `func_1` function correctly sorts each sublist of strings. 

The implementation correctly follows the problem description by:
- Taking a list of lists as input.
- Sorting each sublist in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
- Returning a new list containing the sorted sublists.

Thus, the program does what the problem description asks for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
