#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists where each sublist contains strings and returns a new list of lists, with each sublist sorted in ascending order. It does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-list elements, but it will correctly sort each sublist of strings if they are provided.
