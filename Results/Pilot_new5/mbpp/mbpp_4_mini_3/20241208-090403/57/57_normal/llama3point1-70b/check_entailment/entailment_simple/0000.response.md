Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is specified to be a list of lists containing strings. The program correctly assumes this structure.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. For each `sublist`, it applies the `sorted()` function, which sorts the strings in that sublist.

3. **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: The sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner by utilizing `key=str.lower`. This ensures that strings are compared without regard to their case, which is a common requirement when sorting strings.

4. **Output Type**: The function returns a new list that consists of each sorted sublist, preserving the structure of having a list of lists.

Since the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner and returns the expected output format (a list of lists), it fulfills the requirements set by the problem description for all potential cases.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the problem description and functions as intended.
