The provided program sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner by using the `sorted` function with a key of `str.lower`. 

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears correct as it should sort strings regardless of case. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle edge cases such as empty sublists or sublists containing non-string elements.

Now, looking at the output hints: they state that the function assumes each sublist is well-formed and does not handle cases where a sublist might be empty or contain non-string elements. This is critical because an empty sublist would return an empty list without raising an error, which might be acceptable, but the presence of non-string elements could lead to a TypeError during sorting.

Thus, if we consider these potential edge cases, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically regarding non-string elements.

Therefore, the assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle edge cases such as non-string elements in the sublists, which violates the requirements of the problem description.
