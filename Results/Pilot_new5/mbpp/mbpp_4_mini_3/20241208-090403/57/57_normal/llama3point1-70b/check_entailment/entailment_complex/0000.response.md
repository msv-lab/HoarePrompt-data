Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist contains strings and returns a new list of lists. Each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner using the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower`.

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function processes each sublist individually, ensuring that the sorting is applied to each collection of strings as required.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: By using `key=str.lower`, the sorting ignores the case of the strings, which aligns with the assumption that sorting should be case-insensitive.
3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list of lists, preserving the structure of the original input, which is another requirement of the problem.

While the annotations mention that it does not handle cases where a sublist might be empty or contain non-string elements, the problem description does not specify constraints on the input, such as the presence of empty sublists or the requirement that all elements must be strings. Therefore, since the function adheres to the general requirements stated, it is considered correct.
