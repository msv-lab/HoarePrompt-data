#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner (using str.lower) based on the strings contained in the original list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists where each sublist contains strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. It assumes that each sublist is well-formed and does not handle cases where a sublist might be empty or contain non-string elements.
