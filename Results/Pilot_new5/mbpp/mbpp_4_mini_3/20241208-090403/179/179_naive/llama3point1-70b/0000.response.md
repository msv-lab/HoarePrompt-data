Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

To elaborate, the first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. The function correctly creates a range from `2` to `2n` with a step of `2`, and then it computes the cube of each of these numbers, summing them up. 

For example:
- For `n = 1`, the output should be `2^3 = 8`.
- For `n = 2`, the output should be `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
- For `n = 3`, the output should be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.

In each case, the function produces the expected result. There are no edge cases or scenarios that cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
