To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to ensure the function accurately calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers.
   - The first n even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
   - The cubes of these numbers need to be summed.

2. **Logic of the Function**:
   - It generates a list of the first n even numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`
   - It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers: `cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`
   - Finally, it returns this sum.

3. **Checking the examples given**:
   - For `n = 2`: The even numbers are [2, 4]. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\). The sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\).
   - For `n = 3`: The even numbers are [2, 4, 6]. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
   - For `n = 4`: The even numbers are [2, 4, 6, 8]. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(6^3 = 216\), and \(8^3 = 512\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

4. **Examining Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 0`: The function does not handle this case. It would return `0` since the list of even numbers would be empty and the sum of an empty list is `0`. However, this case could be considered ambiguous based on the problem description, as it does not explicitly state what to do for `n = 0`.
   - For negative values of `n`: The function does not check for negative input, and this may lead to an unexpected behavior or even an empty list generation.

Since the function does not handle the case where `n = 0` or negative values of `n`, it does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
