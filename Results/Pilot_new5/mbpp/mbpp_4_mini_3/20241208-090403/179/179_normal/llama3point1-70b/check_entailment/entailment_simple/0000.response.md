Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers (which are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the nth even number). The nth even natural number can be represented as `2 * n`.

2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to compute the sum.
   - The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2 * n` (inclusive), which is exactly the range of the first `n` even natural numbers.
   - Each of these generated even numbers is cubed (`i ** 3`).

3. **Example of Usage**: 
   - If `n = 3`, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
   - The program correctly computes this by summing the cubes of the generated numbers.

4. **General Case**: 
   - For any non-negative integer `n`, the function will always compute the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, adhering strictly to the problem description.

Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality as required, making it correct per the problem description.
