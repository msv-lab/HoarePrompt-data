Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to take a non-negative integer `n` as input, which aligns with the problem requirement for `n` to be a non-negative integer.

2. **Range of Even Numbers**: The program uses the `range` function starting from 2 up to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of 2. This effectively generates the first `n` even natural numbers:
   - For `n = 1`, it generates [2].
   - For `n = 2`, it generates [2, 4].
   - For `n = 3`, it generates [2, 4, 6], and so on.
   Hence, it correctly identifies the first `n` even natural numbers.

3. **Cube Calculation**: The list comprehension `i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` calculates the cube of each even number generated by the range.

4. **Summation**: The `sum()` function accumulates all the cubes calculated from the list comprehension, resulting in the total cube sum of the specified even natural numbers.

5. **Edge Case for `n = 0`**: When `n` is 0, the range function produces an empty range, and thus the sum of cubes returns 0, which is correct as there are no even numbers to sum.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description by correctly calculating the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for any non-negative integer `n`.
