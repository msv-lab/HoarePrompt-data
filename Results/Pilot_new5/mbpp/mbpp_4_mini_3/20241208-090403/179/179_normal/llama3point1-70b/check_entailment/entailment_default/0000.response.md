The provided program is designed to compute the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function `func_1` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` and sums their cubes.

Let's analyze the code and the problem description:

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```
1. The function uses a generator expression `sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))` to calculate the cube of every even number from 2 to `n * 2`.
2. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 0`:** 
   - According to the problem description, if `n` is 0, the function should return 0 because there are no even numbers to consider.
   - In the code, `range(2, 0 + 1, 2)` results in an empty range, thus returning `sum([])` which correctly results in 0.

2. **Positive `n`:** 
   - For `n = 1`, the expected output is the cube of the first even number (which is 2), i.e., `2^3 = 8`.
   - For `n = 2`, the expected output is the sum of the cubes of the first two even numbers (2 and 4), i.e., `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
   - The function appears to operate correctly for positive integers as well.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints specify that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and sums the cubes of all even numbers from 2 up to `n * 2`, returning 0 for `n = 0`. This aligns with how the function is implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the stated functionality for all cases discussed, including the edge case when `n = 0`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as required for both edge cases and normal cases of non-negative integers.

Thus, I cannot find any case where the code does not follow the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
