Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, generates a list of the first `n` even numbers, calculates the sum of their cubes, and returns that sum. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the cubes of the integers from 1 to `n` multiplied by 8. This means the function effectively returns 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to `n`. **
