The provided program is intended to calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: The task requires finding the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers are: `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. The cube sum would be the sum of these numbers each raised to the power of three.

2. **Reviewing the Program**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly generates the even numbers `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.
   - It then calculates the cube of each even number and sums them up using: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `cube_sum`.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with specific inputs:
   - `func_1(2)` should return `72`: The even numbers are `2` and `4`. Their cubes are `8` and `64`, respectively. The sum is `72`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(3)` should return `288`: The even numbers are `2, 4, 6`. Their cubes are `8, 64, 216`. The sum is `288`, which is also correct.
   - `func_1(4)` should return `800`: The even numbers are `2, 4, 6, 8`. Their cubes are `8, 64, 216, 512`. The sum is `800`, which is correct as well.

4. **General Case**: The function appears to be correct for any non-negative integer `n`. For any `n`, it will generate the first `n` even natural numbers, cube each of them, and sum the results. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Thus, since the program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description for all checked cases and logically for any non-negative integer `n`, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
