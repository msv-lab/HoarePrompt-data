The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it calculates `cube_sum`, which is equal to 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to n.**
