The code creates a list of even numbers by multiplying each integer `i` from 1 to `n` by 2. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the range will generate integers from 1 to `n`. The variable `even_numbers` will be a list of all even numbers from 2 up to `2 * n`.

The previous state of `n` as a non-negative integer remains unchanged, but `even_numbers` is now defined and will contain the calculated list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`, specifically `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n]`.**
