#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum, which is equal to 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, generates a list of the first `n` even numbers, calculates the sum of their cubes, and returns that sum. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the cubes of the integers from 1 to `n` multiplied by 8. This means the function effectively returns 8 times the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to `n`.
