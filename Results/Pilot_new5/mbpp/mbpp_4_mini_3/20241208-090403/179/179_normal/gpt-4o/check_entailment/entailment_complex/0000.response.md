To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements and the actual implementation of the function.

### Problem Description:
The function must find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
```

1. **Generating Even Numbers**: The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` correctly generates the first n even natural numbers:
   - For `n = 1`, it generates `[2]`
   - For `n = 2`, it generates `[2, 4]`
   - For `n = 3`, it generates `[2, 4, 6]`
   - For `n = 4`, it generates `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

2. **Calculating the Cube Sum**: The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` computes the sum of cubes of these even numbers:
   - For `n = 1`: \(2^3 = 8\)
   - For `n = 2`: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\)
   - For `n = 3`: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\)
   - For `n = 4`: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\)

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `cube_sum`, which is indeed the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers and returns this sum.

Thus, the program's output is consistent with the expected results, as verified by the assertions. 

Correctness: **True**
