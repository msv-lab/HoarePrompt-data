To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to ensure that the function computes the cube sum of the first 'n' even natural numbers correctly.

The function `func_1(n)` is designed to:
1. Generate the first 'n' even natural numbers.
2. Compute the sum of their cubes.

### Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Generating Even Numbers**: 
   - The expression `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates even numbers by multiplying each integer from 1 to n by 2. This is correct.

2. **Computing Cube Sum**:
   - The sum of cubes is calculated using `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`. This correctly computes the cube for each even number generated.

### Testing against known outputs:
- For `n = 2`: The even numbers are `[2, 4]`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`. The sum is `8 + 64 = 72`. This matches the assertion.
- For `n = 3`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. Their cubes are `8, 64, 216`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. This matches the assertion.
- For `n = 4`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Their cubes are `8, 64, 216, 512`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`. This matches the assertion.

### Additional Test Cases:
- Let's consider `n = 1`: 
  - The even numbers are `[2]`. Their cube is `2^3 = 8`. The sum is `8`. The function should return `8`, which is not tested in the assertions provided.
- Let's also consider `n = 0`: 
  - In this case, there are no even numbers, so the cube sum should be `0`. The program does not handle this edge case explicitly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the cases of `n = 0` and it lacks checks for non-positive integers. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results or not behave as expected for such input values.

Correctness: **False**
