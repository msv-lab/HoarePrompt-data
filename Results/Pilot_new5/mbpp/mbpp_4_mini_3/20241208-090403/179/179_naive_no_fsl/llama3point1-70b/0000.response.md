To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as per the problem description.

Let's analyze the function `func_1(n)`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes an integer `n` which indicates how many even natural numbers we want to consider.
2. **Range Generation**: 
   - `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to `2 * n`. For example:
     - If `n = 1`, the range will be `[2]`.
     - If `n = 2`, the range will be `[2, 4]`.
     - If `n = 3`, the range will be `[2, 4, 6]`, and so forth.
3. **Cubing**: For each even number generated in the range, it calculates `i ** 3`.
4. **Summation**: It sums up these cubes and returns the result.

### Testing the Function:

1. **Case for `n = 1`**:
   - Even numbers: `[2]`
   - Cube sum: `2^3 = 8`
   - Expected output: `8`
   - Actual output: `func_1(1) = 8` (Correct)

2. **Case for `n = 2`**:
   - Even numbers: `[2, 4]`
   - Cube sum: `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`
   - Expected output: `72`
   - Actual output: `func_1(2) = 72` (Correct)

3. **Case for `n = 3`**:
   - Even numbers: `[2, 4, 6]`
   - Cube sum: `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`
   - Expected output: `288`
   - Actual output: `func_1(3) = 288` (Correct)

4. **Edge Case for `n = 0`**:
   - Even numbers: `[]` (no even numbers)
   - Cube sum: `0` (since there are no numbers)
   - Expected output: `0`
   - Actual output: `func_1(0) = 0` (Correct)

By testing these cases, we observe that the function produces the expected results for all cases provided. 

Since the function correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for all potential input cases including edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
