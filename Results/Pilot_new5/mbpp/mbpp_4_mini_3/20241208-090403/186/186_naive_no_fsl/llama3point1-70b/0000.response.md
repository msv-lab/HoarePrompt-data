To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze what the function `func_1` is intended to do based on the problem description: "Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples."

The function takes in two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and it uses a generator expression combined with the `zip` function to produce a new tuple that contains the bitwise AND of each corresponding pair of elements from the two input tuples.

Let's consider the following points while evaluating its correctness:

1. **Elementwise Operation**: The program uses the bitwise AND operator `&` on the elements of the tuples. This operation is only valid for numeric types and does not handle cases where the elements are not integers (e.g., strings, lists, etc.).

2. **Tuple Lengths**: The `zip` function stops at the end of the shorter tuple. If the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2` are not equal, the program will simply ignore the extra elements of the longer tuple without any warning or error.

3. **Input Types**: The program does not handle invalid input types gracefully. For instance, if one of the tuples contains non-integer types, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Now, let's test the function with some example cases:

- **Case 1**: Input tuples of equal length with integers:
  ```python
  func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))  # Expected output: (0, 0, 2)
  ```
- **Case 2**: Input tuples of different lengths:
  ```python
  func_1((1, 2), (4, 5, 6))  # Expected output: (0, 0), ignores 6
  ```
- **Case 3**: Input with non-integer values:
  ```python
  func_1((1, 'a'), (4, 5))  # Expected to raise TypeError
  ```

Based on the analysis above, we can see that the function does not handle cases with different types of elements and does not provide feedback or handling for different lengths of tuples.

Thus, there are potential cases where the function does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle non-integer types and does not provide feedback for tuples of different lengths, which may lead to unintended behavior or errors.
