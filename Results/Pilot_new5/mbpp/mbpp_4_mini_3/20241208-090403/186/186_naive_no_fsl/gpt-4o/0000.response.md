To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the problem description and the program's implementation.

**Problem description:** The task is to extract element-wise operations from two tuples.

**Program:** 
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

The program uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on corresponding elements of the two tuples. It generates a new tuple containing the results of these operations.

**Assertions to test the function:**
1. `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
3. `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`

Now, let's analyze the provided assertions:
- For the first assertion:
  - `10 & 5` yields `0`
  - `4 & 2` yields `0`
  - `6 & 3` yields `2`
  - `9 & 3` yields `1`
  - Thus, the result is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the assertion.

- For the second assertion:
  - `1 & 5` yields `1`
  - `2 & 6` yields `2`
  - `3 & 7` yields `3`
  - `4 & 8` yields `0`
  - Thus, the result is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the assertion.

- For the third assertion:
  - `8 & 7` yields `0`
  - `9 & 13` yields `9`
  - `11 & 14` yields `10`
  - `12 & 17` yields `0`
  - Thus, the result is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which matches the assertion.

Next, we need to consider edge cases:
1. What if the tuples contain negative numbers?
   - For instance, `assert func_1((-1, -2), (1, 2))` should return `(-1, 0)` because:
     - `-1 & 1` is `-1` (in binary: `...11111111 & ...00000001` results in `...11111111`)
     - `-2 & 2` is `0` (in binary: `...11111110 & ...00000010` results in `...00000000`)

2. Testing with empty tuples:
   - `assert func_1((), ())` should return `()`, as there are no elements to operate on.

3. What if the tuples have different lengths?
   - The function currently assumes both tuples are of equal length, which is not guaranteed. For example, `assert func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` may lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Since we found that the program does not handle cases of tuples with different lengths properly, this presents a clear case where the function can fail.

Therefore, the assessment of the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
