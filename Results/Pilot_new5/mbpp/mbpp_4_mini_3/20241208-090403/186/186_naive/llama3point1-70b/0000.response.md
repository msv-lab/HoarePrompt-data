Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to extract elementwise AND operations from two tuples. However, it does not take into account potential mismatches in the lengths of the input tuples. For example, if `tup1` has a length of 3 and `tup2` has a length of 2, the program would still attempt to perform a bitwise AND operation on the pairs until the shorter tuple's end is reached. This could lead to an incomplete result or even an error if the tuples have no elements in common. 

For instance:

```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)
```

The code will only compute the AND for the first two elements, yielding `(0, 0)`, which is not representative of an operation considering all elements in `tup1`. Thus, it fails to fulfill the requirement of handling tuples of different lengths, demonstrating that the program is incorrect for this case.
