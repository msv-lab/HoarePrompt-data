Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description requires a function to extract the elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the tuples instead of directly extracting the elements. This means that if the elements of the tuples are not integers (for example, if they are strings or floats), the operation would fail or not behave as intended. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of simply extracting the tuples, as it modifies the data instead. Additionally, the program does not address cases where the tuples are of different lengths in terms of returning a relevant result. It truncates to the length of the shorter tuple but does not provide a mechanism to handle or report this situation in accordance with the problem description. Thus, it does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.
