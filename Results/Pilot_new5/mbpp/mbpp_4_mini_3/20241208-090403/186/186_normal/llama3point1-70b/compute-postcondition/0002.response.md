Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will truncate to the length of the shorter tuple, thus not processing any elements beyond that length.**
