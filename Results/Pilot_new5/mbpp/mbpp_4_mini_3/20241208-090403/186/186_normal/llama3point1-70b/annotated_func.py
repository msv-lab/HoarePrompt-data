#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will truncate to the length of the shorter tuple, thus not processing any elements beyond that length.
