To assess the correctness of the provided Python function according to the problem description and output hints, let's break down the analysis step by step.

**Problem Description**: The function should extract the element-wise bitwise AND from two tuples.

**Provided Program**:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

**Initial Assessment**:
1. The function takes two tuples as input.
2. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, allowing it to access corresponding elements from each tuple.
3. For each pair of elements `(x, y)`, it computes the bitwise AND using `x & y`.

**Edge Cases Consideration**:
- If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. This means that any additional elements in the longer tuple will not be considered, which is explicitly stated in the problem description.
- The function does not handle cases where the tuples are empty, but the output for empty tuples is still consistent with the expected behavior of returning an empty tuple, since `zip` on two empty tuples results in an empty iterator.

**Output Hints**: The hints state that the function:
- Returns a tuple of the bitwise AND of corresponding elements.
- Truncates to the shorter tuple's length if they differ.
- This matches the logic in the provided function.

Now, let's see if there are any specific cases that show the function not adhering to the problem description:
1. When both tuples are empty: `func_1((), ())` returns `()`, which is correct.
2. When one tuple is empty: `func_1((1, 2), ())` returns `()`, which is correct.
3. When tuples are of different lengths: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` returns `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)`, which is `(1, 0)`, also correct.

Since there are no edge cases or examples where the function fails to meet the specifications provided in the problem description or the output hints, I conclude that the function behaves correctly.

**Final Assessment**:
Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly computes the element-wise bitwise AND of two tuples, truncating to the length of the shorter tuple if they are of different lengths. It handles edge cases appropriately.
