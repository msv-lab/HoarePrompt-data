Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function should extract "elementwise and tuples" from the given two tuples. However, the program implements the bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the corresponding elements of the tuples, which is not the same as extracting elementwise tuples. 

For example, if we have `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the program will return `(0, 0, 2)` since it performs a bitwise AND on each corresponding pair of elements. This is not a valid extraction of the tuples themselves, as the output does not represent the tuples but rather the result of a bitwise operation. 

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description, which leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
