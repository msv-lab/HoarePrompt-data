To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that extracts the element-wise bitwise AND from the two given tuples.

**Code:**
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The function takes two tuples and uses the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements.
2. It computes the bitwise AND (`&`) of the paired elements and returns them as a new tuple.
3. If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

**Consideration of Edge Cases:**
1. **Different Length Tuples:** The code does not handle the case where the two tuples are of different lengths. The shorter tupleâ€™s length will determine how many elements are processed, which may lead to loss of data from the longer tuple.
2. **Data Type Compatibility:** If the elements in the tuples are not of types that support the bitwise AND operation (like strings or lists), this will result in a runtime error. The code does not check for this, which is a potential issue.

**Output Hints:** 
The hints clearly state that the function will stop processing at the length of the shorter tuple and that there is no data type compatibility check. This confirms the concerns raised in the initial assessment:
- The function does ignore excess elements from the longer tuple.
- There is a risk of runtime errors if non-compatible types are used.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (notably, it doesn't handle tuples of different lengths and lacks type checking), it can be concluded that the implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**. 

The program fails to account for the possibility of tuples being of different lengths and does not perform type checks for the bitwise AND operation, which could lead to runtime errors.
