The program's description states that the function `func_1` is supposed to "extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the implementation of the function performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples instead of extracting elements as described.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Functionality**: The problem description implies that the extraction should be a straightforward process of combining two tuples or extracting elements based on some criteria. However, the function performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not mentioned in the problem description.

2. **Output**: The expected output as per the assertions is a tuple resulting from bitwise AND operations. This does not align with any typical interpretation of "extracting elements" from tuples.

3. **Data Type Compatibility**: The function does not check if the data types of the elements in the tuples are compatible with the bitwise AND operation. This could lead to runtime errors if non-integer types are passed.

4. **Handling Different Lengths**: The function stops processing when it reaches the end of the shorter tuple. The problem description does not indicate that this behavior is acceptable or expected.

Therefore, the implementation does not follow the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
