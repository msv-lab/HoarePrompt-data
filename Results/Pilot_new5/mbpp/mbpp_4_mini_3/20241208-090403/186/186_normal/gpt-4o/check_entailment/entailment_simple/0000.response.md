The provided problem description requires a function that extracts tuple elements elementwise from two given tuples. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` does not align with this requirement.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Functionality**: The function uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between each pair of elements from the two tuples. This means it will perform a bitwise operation rather than simply extracting the elements.
2. **Output**: The expected output should simply involve the elements from both tuples in a specified manner (it does not specify any operation like intersection or bitwise AND). 

### Given Assertions:
- The assertions provided expect specific results based on the output of the function. However, using the bitwise AND operation on various types of inputs (notably integers) will produce results that may not align with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not simply extract elements from the tuples but rather performs a bitwise operation on them.

Correctness: **False**
