#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from tuple1 and tuple2 for each corresponding pair of elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop at the length of the shorter tuple, potentially resulting in some elements from the longer tuple being ignored. The function does not check for data type compatibility, so if the elements are not suitable for the bitwise AND operation, this may lead to a runtime error.
