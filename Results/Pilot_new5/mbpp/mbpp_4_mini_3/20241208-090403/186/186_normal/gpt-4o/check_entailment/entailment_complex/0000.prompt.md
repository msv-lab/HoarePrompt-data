You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from tuple1 and tuple2 for each corresponding pair of elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop at the length of the shorter tuple, potentially resulting in some elements from the longer tuple being ignored. The function does not check for data type compatibility, so if the elements are not suitable for the bitwise AND operation, this may lead to a runtime error.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
