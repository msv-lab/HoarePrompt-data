The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type. The function returns a tuple that contains the intersection of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2` for each corresponding pair of elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple that represents the intersection of elements from the input tuples at corresponding positions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from tuple1 and tuple2 for each corresponding pair of elements.**
