Correctness: **False**.

The provided program `func_1` does not handle the case of empty lists correctly. If the input list of lists is empty (e.g., `func_1([])`), the function will return `(0, [])`, which is not the intended behavior since there are no lists to evaluate. The expected output for such a case is not specified in the problem description, but logically, it should return something indicating that there are no lists to find the maximum length from. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle this potential edge case.
