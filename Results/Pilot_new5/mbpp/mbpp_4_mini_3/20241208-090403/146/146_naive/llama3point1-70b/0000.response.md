Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the call to `max()` will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot find the maximum length of an empty sequence. This means that for the input `list_of_lists = []`, the program does not behave as expected, leading to incorrect functionality.
