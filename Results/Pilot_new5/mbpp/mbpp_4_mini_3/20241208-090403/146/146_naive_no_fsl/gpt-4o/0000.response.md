To verify the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, we need to ensure it correctly identifies the list with the maximum length from a list of lists and returns both the length of that list and the list itself.

### Analysis of the Function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate since no list can have a negative length.
   - `max_list` is initialized to an empty list, which will hold the longest list found.

2. **Iteration**: 
   - The function iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each list (`lst`), it checks if its length is greater than `max_len`.
   - If it is, it updates both `max_len` and `max_list`.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

### Test Cases Provided:
- The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected values. Let's analyze them:
  - For `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the longest list is `[13, 15, 17]` with a length of 3. This is correct.
  - For `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, the longest list is `[10, 12, 14, 15]` with a length of 4. This is correct.
  - For `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, the longest list is `[15, 20, 25]` with a length of 3. This is also correct.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty Input**: What happens if the input list is empty, e.g., `func_1([])`? The function should return `(0, [])`, which is the expected behavior.
2. **Multiple Longest Lists**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered should be returned. For example, `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])` should return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, which it does.

3. **Single Element Lists**: If all lists contain a single element, e.g., `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])`, it should return `(1, [1])`, which it does.

4. **Lists with Zero Length**: If the input contains empty lists, e.g., `func_1([[], [], []])`, it should return `(0, [])`, which is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the function and considering possible edge cases, the function correctly handles all the described scenarios. There are no instances identified where the function does not perform as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
