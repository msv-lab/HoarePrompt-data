Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it only returns the first maximum-length sublist instead of all of them. 

For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`. The maximum length is 3, and the expected output should be `([3, 4, 5])` (a list of all maximum length sublists), but the program will return `(3, [3, 4, 5])`, which does not fulfill the requirement of returning all maximum-length sublists. 

Another edge case is if there are multiple sublists of maximum length, e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]`. The expected output should be `([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`, but the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, again failing to provide all sublists of maximum length.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
