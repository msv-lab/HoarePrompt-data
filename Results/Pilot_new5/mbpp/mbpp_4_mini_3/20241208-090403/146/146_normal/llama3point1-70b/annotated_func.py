#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying length.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` as `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`, which contains all sublists of that maximum length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists and returns the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If there are no sublists, it will raise a ValueError due to the call to `max` on an empty input, which is not handled in the code.
