The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying length. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` as `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`, which contains all sublists of that maximum length. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of sublists and return the maximum length of those sublists along with the first sublist that has that maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the maximum length of the sublists as max_len, and the first sublist from the maximum length sublists.**
