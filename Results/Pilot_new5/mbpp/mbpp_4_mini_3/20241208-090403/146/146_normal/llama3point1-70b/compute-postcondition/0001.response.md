The variable `max_sublists` is assigned a list comprehension that iterates through `list_of_lists` and includes each `sublist` that has a length equal to `max_len`. The value of `max_sublists` will now be a list containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` that are exactly of length `max_len`. The state of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` that have length equal to `max_len`.**
