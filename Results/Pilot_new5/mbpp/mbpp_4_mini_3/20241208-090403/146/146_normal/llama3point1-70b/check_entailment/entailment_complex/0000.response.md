Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Output Requirements**: The problem description specifies that the function should return a list of maximum length sublists, while the program returns only the maximum length and the first sublist of that maximum length instead of returning all sublists with that length.

2. **Handling of Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. The call to `max` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. Thus, if the input is an empty list, the program will not function correctly, violating the requirement to work with a list of lists.

3. **Lack of Robustness**: The program assumes there will always be at least one sublist to evaluate. It fails to account for scenarios where the input list may not contain any sublists.

Because of these issues, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. It does not return all sublists of maximum length and does not handle empty input properly. Thus, the correctness of the program is false.
