Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description, which requires the function to return "the list of maximum length in a list of lists." The program instead returns the maximum length as a separate value along with only the first sublist that has this maximum length. 

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Return Values**: The function is designed to return a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of that maximum length. However, the problem description only asks for the list(s) that have the maximum length, not the length itself.
2. **Multiple Sublists**: The function ignores the possibility of multiple sublists having the same maximum length by only returning the first one. The expected output should include all sublists of maximum length, not just one.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem description.
