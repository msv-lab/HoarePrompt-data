The provided function `func_1` is intended to find the maximum length sublist from a list of lists and return both the maximum length and the first sublist of that length. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

1. The function uses `max` to find the maximum length of the sublists, which works correctly when there are sublists present.
2. It then creates a new list `max_sublists` containing all sublists that have that maximum length and returns the first one.

However, the function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. When it tries to calculate `max` on an empty iterable, it will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the function will not meet the requirement in the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when `list_of_lists` is empty.

Next, let's check the output hints:
- The output hints indicate that the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the call to `max` on an empty input, which confirms that this edge case is indeed not handled properly in the code.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically, it fails with an empty list), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the scenario of an empty list, which should have returned an appropriate error or a defined output according to the problem description.
