`max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.**
