The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the length and the content of the longest sublist, while handling the case where the input list is empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists and returns the length of the longest sublist as max_len and the longest sublist as max_list. If list_of_lists is empty, it returns 0 for max_len and an empty list for max_list.**
