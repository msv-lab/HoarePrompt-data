Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists and correctly identifies the longest sublist within that list. Let's break down its functionality:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list, which are appropriate starting values for tracking the length and content of the longest sublist.

2. **Iteration through each sublist**: The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, checking the length of each. 

3. **Updating the longest sublist**: If a sublist is found that is longer than the current `max_len`, the function updates both `max_len` and `max_list` to reflect this new longest sublist.

4. **Return values**: After checking all sublists, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`. If no sublists are present (the input list is empty), the return values will indeed be `(0, [])`, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Handling ties**: The function returns the first longest sublist it encounters in the case of ties, which is also acceptable according to the problem description, as it does not specify how to handle ties.

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate that the function produces expected results for given inputs, further confirming that the implementation correctly follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
