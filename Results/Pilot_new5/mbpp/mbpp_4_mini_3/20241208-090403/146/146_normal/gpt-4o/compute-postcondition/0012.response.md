The value of `max_len` is assigned the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, the value of `max_len` will now reflect the length of that specific sublist. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` remains unchanged or may change based on the length of `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` remains unchanged or may change based on the length of `lst`.**
