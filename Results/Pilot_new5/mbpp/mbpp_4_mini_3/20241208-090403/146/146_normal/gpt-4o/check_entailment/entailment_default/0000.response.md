To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we shall first analyze the code and then check it against the provided hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires a function that finds the longest list (by length) within a list of lists. The function should return a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself. If the input list is empty, it should return `(0, [])`.

### Analyzing the Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```
- The function initializes `max_len` to `0` and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`.
- If a list's length is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
- After the loop, it returns a tuple of `max_len` and `max_list`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input List**: The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `(0, [])` because none of the conditions will be satisfied, but it was not explicitly checked.
2. **Multiple Lists with the Same Maximum Length**: The description states that if there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, the first one encountered should be returned. The code does this correctly by only updating `max_list` when a longer list is found.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list of lists and returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself.
- If the input list is empty, it returns `0` for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list`.
- The function correctly identifies the longest sublist and will return the first one encountered if there are multiple of the same length.

### Conclusion:
- The output hints agree with the logic of the code, except for the handling of the empty list case, which the code does not explicitly check. Therefore, technically, the function is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty input list as described.
  
Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty input list, which means it may not work correctly for that scenario.
