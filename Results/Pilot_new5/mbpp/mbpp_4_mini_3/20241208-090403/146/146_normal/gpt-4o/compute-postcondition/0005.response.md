`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. Since `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` will now contain that sublist. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is now equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
