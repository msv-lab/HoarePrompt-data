The variable `max_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths; `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list.**
