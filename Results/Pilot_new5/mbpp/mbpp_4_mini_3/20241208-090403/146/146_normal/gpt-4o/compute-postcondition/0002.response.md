According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. The current state indicates that `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 sublist, and during the first iteration, `lst` should be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list**
