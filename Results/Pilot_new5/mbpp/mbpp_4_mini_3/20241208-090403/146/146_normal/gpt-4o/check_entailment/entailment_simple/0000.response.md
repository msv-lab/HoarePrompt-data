Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` must return the list of maximum length along with its length in a tuple. However, the program has a flaw in its implementation regarding the handling of empty lists.

1. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function correctly sets `max_len` to `0` and `max_list` to an empty list. However, based on the assertions provided, there are no tests that validate this specific scenario. This means that the function may not correctly handle the expected output format for an empty input.

2. The problem description implies that the function should work for any given list of lists, including scenarios where the input is empty or only contains empty sublists. The current implementation lacks a return value for such cases, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed that it behaves as required in every potential case.

3. The assertions provided do not include any tests for the edge case of an empty list of lists, which suggests the test coverage is insufficient to validate the correctness of the function for all scenarios.

Due to these reasons, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect since it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list of lists, which is a valid input condition.
