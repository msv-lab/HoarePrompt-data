#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists, and max_list, which is the longest sublist in list_of_lists. If list_of_lists is empty, then max_len is 0 and max_list is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists and returns two values: the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and the longest sublist itself (`max_list`). If the input list is empty, it returns `0` for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list`. The function correctly identifies the longest sublist, even if there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length, it will return the first one encountered.
