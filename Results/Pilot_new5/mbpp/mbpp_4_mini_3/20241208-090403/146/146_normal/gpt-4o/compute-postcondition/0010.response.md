Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` remains unchanged, `max_list` is updated to be equal to `lst`, and `max_len` is set to the length of `lst`. Otherwise, there is no change to `max_len` and `max_list`.***
