The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the length of the first sublist `lst` from `list_of_lists`. Given that the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, which is currently 0, the new value of `max_len` will be equal to `len(lst)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list.**
