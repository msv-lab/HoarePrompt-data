Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, if the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is set to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is set to `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
