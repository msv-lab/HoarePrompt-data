The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the second sublist from `list_of_lists`. The values of `list_of_lists`, `lst`, and `max_len` remain unchanged during this operation, but now `max_list` will reference the same content as `lst`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists; `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`; `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`; `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
