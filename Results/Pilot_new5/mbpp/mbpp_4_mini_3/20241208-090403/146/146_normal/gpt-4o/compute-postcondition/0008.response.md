The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, which indicates the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The values of `list_of_lists` and `max_list` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `max_len`, which is equal to the length of `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` remains unchanged.**
