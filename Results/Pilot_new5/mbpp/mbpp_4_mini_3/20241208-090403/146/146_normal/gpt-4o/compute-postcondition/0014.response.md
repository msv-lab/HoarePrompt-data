Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, if the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to `len(lst)` and `max_list` is set to `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged and `max_list` is not updated.***
