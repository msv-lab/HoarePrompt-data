The code assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. Since `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` now refers to this specific sublist. The previous value of `max_list` remains unchanged unless it was pointing to a different list, in which case it now references `lst`. The state of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and now `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
