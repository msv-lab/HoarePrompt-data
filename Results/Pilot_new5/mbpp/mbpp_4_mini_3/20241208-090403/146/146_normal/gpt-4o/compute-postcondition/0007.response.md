According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. The loop will execute for each sublist in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in that list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must refer to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. This means that `lst` should be the second sublist, and we can denote the possible length of this new `lst` as `len(lst)`.

Since `list_of_lists` originally had at least 1 sublist, to ensure the loop continues, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 sublists.

State: **`list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` remains unchanged, `max_list` remains unchanged**
