The annotated program is intended to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \). However, the implementation provided does not fulfill this requirement.

The function `func_1(n)` computes \( 2^{(n - 1)} \). This result does not correspond to the sum of even index binomial coefficients of \( n \). The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \) is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \binom{n}{2k}
\]

The assertion checks (e.g., `assert func_1(4) == 8`) seem to suggest specific expected outputs, but they do not align with the expected outputs based on the problem description. In fact, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for \( n = 4 \) should yield \( 8 \) (which is correct) due to \( \binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{4} = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \). However, for \( n = 6 \) the expected sum should be \( 20 \) and for \( n = 2 \) it should be \( 2 \), which the function does not compute.

The function's logic does not reflect the requirement of summing the binomial coefficients at even indices. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
