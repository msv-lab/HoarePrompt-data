Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). However, the function `func_1(n)` simply returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \), which does not compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

To illustrate this with a counterexample, consider the calculation for \( n = 4 \):
- The binomial coefficients for \( n = 4 \) are \( \binom{4}{0}, \binom{4}{1}, \binom{4}{2}, \binom{4}{3}, \binom{4}{4} \), which are \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \).
- The even index binomial coefficients are \( \binom{4}{0} = 1 \) and \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \). Their sum is \( 1 + 6 = 7 \).
- However, `func_1(4)` returns \( 2^{(4 - 1)} = 8 \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the function does not perform the required computation as per the problem description.
