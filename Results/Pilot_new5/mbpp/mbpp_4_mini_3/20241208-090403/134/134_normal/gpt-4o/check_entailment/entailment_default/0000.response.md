To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Program Code:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`.
2. The assertions provided check for specific values:
   - For `n = 4`, it checks that the function returns `8`.
   - For `n = 6`, it checks that the function returns `32`.
   - For `n = 2`, it checks that the function returns `2`.

### Understanding the Required Logic:
- The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given integer typically relates to combinatorial mathematics, specifically how coefficients from the binomial expansion are calculated.
- The binomial coefficients correspond to the terms in the expansion of `(x + y)^n`, and the even indexed coefficients are those corresponding to even powers of `x` and `y`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function correctly computes `2 ** (n - 1)` for any positive integer input and states that there are no edge cases or missing logic.

### Verification:
We need to verify whether the function indeed calculates the desired sum of even index binomial coefficients:
- The sum of even index binomial coefficients for `n` is given by `C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + ...`, where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient.
- The correct formula for the sum of even indexed binomial coefficients is indeed `2 ** (n - 1)`, which aligns perfectly with what the function `func_1` returns.

### Edge Cases:
1. The program only considers positive integers as inputs, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. Since the program computes `2 ** (n - 1)`, it handles all cases of positive integers correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code follows the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases as confirmed by the output hints. No discrepancies or missing logic have been identified.

Correctness: **True**. 
Explanation: The function computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients correctly for all positive integers, as it returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is the correct mathematical evaluation. The assertions confirm this for specific values.
