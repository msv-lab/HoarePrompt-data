#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` is equal to the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum which is equal to the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` from 0 to `n`. If `n` is negative, the behavior is undefined since the function does not handle negative inputs.
