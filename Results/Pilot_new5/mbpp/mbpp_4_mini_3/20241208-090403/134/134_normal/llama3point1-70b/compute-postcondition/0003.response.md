To determine the output state after executing the code, we start with the initial conditions:

1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `sum` is initially 0.
3. `i` is initially 0, and since `i` is even, `i % 2 == 0` holds true.

The operation being executed is:
```
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

Here, `math.comb(n, i)` computes the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, which is represented mathematically as \( C(n, i) \) or \( \binom{n}{i} \). Since `i` is 0, the formula simplifies to \( C(n, 0) = 1 \) for any positive integer `n`.

Thus, the operation modifies `sum` as follows:
- `sum` becomes `0 + 1`, therefore `sum` now equals `1`.

Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0**
