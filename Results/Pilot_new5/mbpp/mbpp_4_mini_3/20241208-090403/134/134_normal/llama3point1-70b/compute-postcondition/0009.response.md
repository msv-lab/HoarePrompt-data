The variable `sum` is being updated with the result of `math.comb(n, i)`, which computes the binomial coefficient "n choose i". The initial state indicates that `sum` is equal to `1 + n` if `i` is even, or `1` if `i` is odd, and that `i` is currently `2`. 

Since `i` is even, we know that `sum` starts off as `1 + n`. The new value of `sum` will then be `1 + n + math.comb(n, 2)`.

The value of `math.comb(n, 2)` is calculated as `n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)`, which simplifies to `n * (n - 1) / 2` for `n >= 2`.

Thus, the updated value of `sum` becomes:
- `sum = 1 + n + (n * (n - 1) / 2)`

The value of `i` remains `2` since it has not been changed in the code provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n + (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, `i` is 2**
