According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `n`, inclusive. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is even, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and since it still needs to be less than or equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
