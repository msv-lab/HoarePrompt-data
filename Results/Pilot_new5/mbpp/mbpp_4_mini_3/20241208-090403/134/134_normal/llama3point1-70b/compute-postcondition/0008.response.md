According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to 1 + `n` if `i` is even; if `i` is odd, `sum` remains 1 and `i` is 2**
