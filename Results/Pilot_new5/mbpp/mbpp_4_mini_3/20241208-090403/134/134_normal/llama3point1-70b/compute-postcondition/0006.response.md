The value of `sum` is updated to include the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)`, where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. The value of `math.comb(n, 1)` equals `n`, because the binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose 1 element from `n`, which is simply `n`. Thus, `sum` becomes `1 + n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, while `sum` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
