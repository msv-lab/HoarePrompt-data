Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input. The problem description states it must handle a positive integer, and while the code does not explicitly check for negativity, it is reasonable to assume that the user will provide a positive integer based on the problem constraints.

2. **Calculation of Binomial Coefficients**: The program uses `math.comb(n, i)` to compute the binomial coefficients for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`. The use of `math.comb` is appropriate as it computes the binomial coefficient \( C(n, i) \), which counts the number of ways to choose `i` elements from a set of `n` elements.

3. **Summing Even Index Coefficients**: The program correctly identifies and sums the coefficients for even indices. The condition `if i % 2 == 0:` ensures that only coefficients at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n` if `n` is even) are included in the sum.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the correct value, which is the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices, fulfilling the requirement stated in the problem description.

Therefore, since the program effectively computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`, it adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description.
