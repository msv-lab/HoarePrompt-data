Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Specification**: The function takes a single positive integer `n`, as required. The program correctly identifies this input parameter.

2. **Output Specification**: The function returns the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients, which corresponds to the binomial coefficients computed using `math.comb(n, i)` for every even index `i` from 0 to `n`.

3. **Logic**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n`. Within the loop, it checks if the index `i` is even (`if i % 2 == 0:`). If it is, it includes that binomial coefficient in the running total (`sum`). This captures all even indices correctly since `i` takes every value from 0 to `n`.

4. **Final Return Value**: After completing the loop, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients is returned.

Thus, the program correctly implements the requested functionality, ensuring accurate computation of the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer `n`.
