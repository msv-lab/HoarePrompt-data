According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` in the range from `0` to `n + 1`, inclusive of `0` and exclusive of `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute `n + 1` times (from `0` to `n`). 

At the start of the first execution of the loop, `i` will be `0`. The variable `sum` is initialized to `0` and does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are that `i` will be `0` at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop, and `n` must remain a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
