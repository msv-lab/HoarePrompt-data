To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(n)` and its purpose, which is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Problem Analysis

The sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \) refers to the sum of coefficients \( C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots \) where \( C(n, k) \) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k". 

The sum of the even indexed coefficients can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of even indexed coefficients} = \frac{1}{2} (2^n + 1) \text{ for even } n
\]
\[
\text{Sum of even indexed coefficients} = \frac{1}{2} (2^n - 1) \text{ for odd } n
\]

### Code Analysis

The provided implementation:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

This function returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which does not correctly represent the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. 

### Testing Provided Cases

1. **For \( n = 4 \)**:
   - **Expected**: \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \)
   - **Returned**: \( 2^{(4-1)} = 8 \)
   - **Result**: Incorrect

2. **For \( n = 6 \)**:
   - **Expected**: \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \)
   - **Returned**: \( 2^{(6-1)} = 32 \)
   - **Result**: Incorrect

3. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - **Expected**: \( C(2, 0) = 1 \)
   - **Returned**: \( 2^{(2-1)} = 2 \)
   - **Result**: Incorrect

### Conclusion

The function does not correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any of the provided test cases. It consistently produces results that do not align with the expected values based on the mathematical definitions.

Correctness: **False**.
