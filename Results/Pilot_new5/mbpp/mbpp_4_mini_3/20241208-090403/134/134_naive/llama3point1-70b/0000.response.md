Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. The function `math.comb(n, i)` is used to compute the binomial coefficient, and the loop iterates from `0` to `n`, checking if the index `i` is even. If `i` is even, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the `sum`. 

The code handles all cases for positive integers properly, as it will correctly compute the sum of the binomial coefficients for all even indices, including when `n` is `0` (which will yield `1` since `C(0,0) = 1`). There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the code to misbehave according to the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
