Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The `func_1` function iterates through each item in the input `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to `flat_list`.

The assertions included in the program test various cases of nested lists, and they all evaluate to the expected flat lists. The logic correctly handles lists of any depth and any combination of nested and non-nested items.

Since I could not identify any edge cases or examples where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
