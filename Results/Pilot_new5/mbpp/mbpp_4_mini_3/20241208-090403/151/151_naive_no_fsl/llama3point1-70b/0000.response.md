Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list structure. It handles cases of varying depths of nesting effectively by checking the type of each element in the input list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the results. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to the `flat_list`.

The implementation covers various scenarios, including:
1. An empty list, which will simply return an empty list.
2. A list with only non-list elements, which will return the same list.
3. A list with nested lists of varying depths, which will be fully flattened.

For example:
- Input: `[1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]` will output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Input: `[[[1]], 2]` will output `[1, 2]`.

Since I cannot identify any input or edge case where the program would fail to flatten the nested list as described, I conclude that the program is correct.
