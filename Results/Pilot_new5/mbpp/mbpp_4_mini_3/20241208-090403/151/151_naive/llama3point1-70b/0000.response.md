Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the flattening of a nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the provided `nested_list`. If an item is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that list, and if an item is not a list, it appends that item directly to `flat_list`. This logic correctly handles any level of nesting, ensuring that all elements are extracted into a single, flat list. 

For example:
- Input: `[1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]` would yield the output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected result.
- Input: `[[[1, 2], 3], 4]` would yield: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

As such, the function operates correctly in terms of the requirements laid out in the problem description.
