Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by checking if each item is a list. If it is, the function recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`. 

The assertions given test various nested list scenarios and the outputs are as expected:
1. For the input `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]`, the output is `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`, which is correct.
2. For the input `[[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]`, the output is `[10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]`, which is correct.
3. For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]`, which is also correct.

The function handles both flat lists and nested lists properly, including multiple levels of nesting, as well as empty lists. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
