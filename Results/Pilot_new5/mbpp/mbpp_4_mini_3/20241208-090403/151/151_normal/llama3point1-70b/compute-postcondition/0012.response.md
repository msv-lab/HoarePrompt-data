The variable `i` is assigned the value of the third element in the `nested_list`. The function `func_1(i)` is called with `i` as its argument, and the result of that function call is then extended to `flat_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State captures all relevant information.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list; `flat_list` is updated with the result from `func_1(i)`.**
