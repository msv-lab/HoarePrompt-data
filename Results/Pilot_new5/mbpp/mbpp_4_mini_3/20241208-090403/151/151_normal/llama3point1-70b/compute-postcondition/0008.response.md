To determine the output state, we analyze the initial state and the effect of the code snippet provided.

1. The variable `i` is taken as the second element of `nested_list`.
2. The function `func_1(i)` is called with `i` as an argument. The output of this function is assumed to be a list since it is being extended to `flat_list`.
3. The `extend` method is applied to `flat_list`, which means that the elements returned by `func_1(i)` will be added to the end of `flat_list`.

We do not have specific information about the content of `nested_list`, `flat_list`, or the output of `func_1(i)`, but we know that `flat_list` will be updated to include whatever is returned from `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least two elements, `flat_list` is updated to include the elements returned from `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the second element in `nested_list`.**
