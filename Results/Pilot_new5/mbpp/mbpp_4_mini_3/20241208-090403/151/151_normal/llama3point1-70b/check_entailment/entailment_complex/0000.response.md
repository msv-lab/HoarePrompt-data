Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which can contain integers or other lists. This matches the problem description, which specifies that the input can be a nested list structure.

2. **Flattening Logic**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element of `nested_list`. It checks if the current element (`i`) is a list using `type(i) == list`. If it is, the function calls itself recursively (`func_1(i)`) to handle the nested list, effectively flattening it. If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it appends the integer to `flat_list`. This recursive approach ensures that all levels of nesting are addressed.

3. **Output Structure**: After processing all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all integers collected from `nested_list` and any nested lists. The program also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list.

4. **Comment Annotations**: The annotations in the code accurately describe the state of the variables at various points in execution, reinforcing that `flat_list` accumulates the correct elements.

In summary, the function fulfills the requirement of flattening a nested list structure by recursively traversing and collecting integers, and thus aligns perfectly with the problem description.
