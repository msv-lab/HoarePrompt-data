Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires flattening a nested list structure. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to traverse through the nested list. If it encounters another list, it calls itself to flatten that sub-list, ensuring that all levels of nesting are handled.

2. **Appending Non-list Elements**: For elements that are not lists (i.e., integers), it appends them directly to the `flat_list`. This behavior aligns with the requirement to include all integers from the nested list structure.

3. **Returns a Fully Flattened List**: After processing all elements, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all integers from the original input list, regardless of how deeply they were nested. If the input list is empty, the output will also be an empty list, as expected.

The program effectively handles various cases of nested lists, including:
- Lists containing only integers.
- Lists that have varying levels of nested lists.
- Empty lists.

This guarantees that the function adheres to the problem requirements, thus confirming its correctness.
