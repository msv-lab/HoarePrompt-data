The code `flat_list.append(i)` is executed, which means the value of `i` (the third element of `nested_list`) is added to `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is specifically the third element of that list. The operation does not change any of the existing values in `nested_list` or `i`, but it modifies `flat_list` by adding a new element to it.

Since no information about `flat_list` was provided in the initial state, we can only mention that it now contains an additional element:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in `nested_list`; `flat_list` now includes the third element `i` from `nested_list`.**
