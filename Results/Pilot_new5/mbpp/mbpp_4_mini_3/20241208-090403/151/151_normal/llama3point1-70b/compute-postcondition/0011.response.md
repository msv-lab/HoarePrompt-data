According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least two elements, the first iteration will process the first element in the list, and in the second iteration, it will process the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least three elements, and the next value of `i` will be the third element in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list.**
