According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains more elements, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one element and we have processed the first element `i`. 

Since we are iterating through `nested_list`, we need to consider the index of the current element being processed. If the loop has executed once, we will move to the next element in `nested_list`. If the current element was the first one, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least two elements. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are moving to the second element in `nested_list`. The new state will indicate that `flat_list` may or may not change depending on whether the next element is a list or a single element.

State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least two elements, flat_list remains as is, i is the second element in nested_list**
