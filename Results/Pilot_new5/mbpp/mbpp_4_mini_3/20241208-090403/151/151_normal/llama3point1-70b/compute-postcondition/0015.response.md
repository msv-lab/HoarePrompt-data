To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the information provided.

1. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers or other lists, and `flat_list` starts empty.
2. The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`.
3. If `i` is a list, the function `func_1(i)` is called, and the result is added to `flat_list`. If `i` is an integer, it is appended directly to `flat_list`.

To summarize the transformation of `flat_list` after all iterations of the loop:

- If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains empty.
- If `nested_list` contains one or more elements, `flat_list` will contain all integers from `nested_list` directly, and if any element is a list, the results from `func_1` applied to those lists will also be included in `flat_list`.

Given that `flat_list` will ultimately contain all elements from `nested_list`, both integers and the flattened results from any nested lists processed through `func_1`, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` and all elements returned from `func_1` applied to any sub-lists within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is also empty.**
