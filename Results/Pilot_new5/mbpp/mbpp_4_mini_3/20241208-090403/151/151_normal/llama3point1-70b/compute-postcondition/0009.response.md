The code `flat_list.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is the second element in `nested_list`) to the `flat_list`. The values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` are not modified directly by the code but `flat_list` will contain an additional element, which is the value of `i`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we simply note that `flat_list` has been modified by appending `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing at least two elements, `flat_list` now includes the value of `i`, where `i` is the second element in `nested_list`.**
