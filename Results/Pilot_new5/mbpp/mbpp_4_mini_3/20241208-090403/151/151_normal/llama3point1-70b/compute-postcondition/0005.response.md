The statement `flat_list.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `flat_list`. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is not a list itself, we can conclude that `i` is being added to `flat_list`. The variable `flat_list` will now contain this new element `i`, while the states of `nested_list` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and `i` is not a list, `flat_list` now contains the element `i`.**
