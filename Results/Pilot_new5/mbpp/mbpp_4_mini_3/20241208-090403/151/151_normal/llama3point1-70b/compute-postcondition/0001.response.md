According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list is not empty, the loop will execute, iterating over its elements. Since `flat_list` is empty and does not affect the loop execution, we need to ensure that `nested_list` contains at least one element for the loop to run. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` would need to be initialized to the first element of `nested_list` during the first iteration.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`**
