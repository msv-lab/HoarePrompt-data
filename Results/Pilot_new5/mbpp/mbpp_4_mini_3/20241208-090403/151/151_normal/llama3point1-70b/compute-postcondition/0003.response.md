The variable `flat_list` is extended by the result of the function `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and `i` is a list. The values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` are not directly affected aside from `flat_list`, which will now include the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` (a list), and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`**.
