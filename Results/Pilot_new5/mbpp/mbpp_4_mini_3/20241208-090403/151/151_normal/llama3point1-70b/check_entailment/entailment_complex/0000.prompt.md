You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists, which can be nested to any level.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` and all elements returned from `func_1` applied to any sub-lists within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is also empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all integers from nested_list and all elements returned from func_1 applied to any sub-lists within nested_list. If nested_list is empty, flat_list is also empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nested_list` which may contain integers or other lists (including nested lists). It returns a flat list containing all integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. If `nested_list` is empty, it will return an empty list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
