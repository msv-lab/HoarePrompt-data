According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least 3 items, the loop will run once more for the third item in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 items and `item` is the second element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 3 items, and `item` will need to be the third element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third element in the list.**
