Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a nested list structure. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers and/or other lists nested to any depth. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Recursion**: The implementation uses recursion to handle nested lists. For each item in the `nested_list`, it checks if the item is a list. If it is, it makes a recursive call to `func_1(item)`, which effectively flattens any further nested lists. This ensures that regardless of how deeply nested the integers are, they will be included in the final flattened list.

3. **Appending Integers**: If the item is not a list, it directly appends the integer to the `flat_list`. This guarantees that all integers present in the input, whether they are in nested lists or not, will be included in the output.

4. **Final Output**: The function returns `flat_list`, which will contain all the integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists. If the input list is empty, `flat_list` will also be empty, which is the expected behavior.

5. **Assertions**: The provided assertions confirm that the function correctly flattens various nested list structures, yielding the expected outputs.

Overall, the recursive structure of the function effectively handles any level of nesting, which ensures compliance with the problem requirement to flatten a given nested list. All test cases provided in the assertions return the correct flattened lists, validating the implementation.
