According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. Since `flat_list` is empty at the start, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must contain at least one item. At the beginning of the first iteration, `item` will be set to the first element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is an empty list**
