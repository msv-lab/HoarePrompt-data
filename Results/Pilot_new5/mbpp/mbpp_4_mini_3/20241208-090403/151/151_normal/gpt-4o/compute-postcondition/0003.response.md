To analyze the code snippet provided, we note the following:

- The variable `flat_list` is an empty list initially.
- The variable `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, which is itself a list (as stated).
- The function `func_1(item)` is called, which should return a list that will be extended to `flat_list`.

Since the exact output of `func_1(item)` is unknown but it will return some list derived from `item`, we cannot specify its exact contents. However, we know that `flat_list` will be updated to include whatever list is returned by `func_1(item)`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `flat_list` now contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, while other variables maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.**
