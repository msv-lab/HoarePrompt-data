To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we start with the `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both. The `flat_list` starts as an empty list and will accumulate the results from processing each `item` in `nested_list`.

The loop operates by iterating over each `item` in `nested_list`. If `item` is itself a list, it processes that list via `func_1(item)` and extends `flat_list` with the results. If `item` is not a list, it directly appends the `item` to `flat_list`.

The conditions for the output state after all iterations are as follows:

- If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `flat_list` will remain empty.
- If `nested_list` contains at least one item, `flat_list` will include either the items themselves or the results from `func_1()` applied to any sublists.

Given these explanations, we conclude that:

1. If `nested_list` is empty: 
   - `flat_list` is an empty list.
2. If `nested_list` contains any items:
   - `flat_list` is a flattened version of all integers from `nested_list` and any integers returned from processing sublists via `func_1()`. 

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is determined by the contents of `nested_list` and how `func_1()` operates on any nested lists.

Output State: **If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is an empty list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` plus any integers returned from `func_1()` applied to each nested list within `nested_list`.**
