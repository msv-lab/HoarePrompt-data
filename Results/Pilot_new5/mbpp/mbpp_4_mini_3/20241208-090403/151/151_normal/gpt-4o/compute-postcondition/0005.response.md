The code takes the variable `item`, which is the first element of `nested_list`, and appends it to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` is initially empty, after the execution of the code, `flat_list` will contain one element, which is `item`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we still know that `nested_list` must contain at least one item and that `item` is not a list. 

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains `item`, and `item` is not a list.**
