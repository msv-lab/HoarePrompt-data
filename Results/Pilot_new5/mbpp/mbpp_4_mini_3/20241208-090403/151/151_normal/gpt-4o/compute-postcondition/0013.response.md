The code `flat_list.append(item)` adds the value of `item`, which is the third element of `nested_list`, to the `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` is not affected by this operation, but the `flat_list` will now include the item. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.**
