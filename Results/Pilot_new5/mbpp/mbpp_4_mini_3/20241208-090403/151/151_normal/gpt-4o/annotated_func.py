#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both, and can be nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is an empty list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` plus any integers returned from `func_1()` applied to each nested list within `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all integers from nested_list and any integers returned from func_1() applied to each nested list within nested_list. If nested_list is empty, flat_list is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list, `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both at any level of nesting. It returns a flattened list containing all integers from `nested_list`, including those contained within any nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers, it returns an empty list.
