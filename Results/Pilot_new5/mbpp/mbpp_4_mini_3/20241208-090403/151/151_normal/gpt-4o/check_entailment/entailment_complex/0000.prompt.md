You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both, and can be nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is an empty list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` plus any integers returned from `func_1()` applied to each nested list within `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all integers from nested_list and any integers returned from func_1() applied to each nested list within nested_list. If nested_list is empty, flat_list is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list, `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both at any level of nesting. It returns a flattened list containing all integers from `nested_list`, including those contained within any nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers, it returns an empty list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
