The `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the third element in the `nested_list`. The value of `item` is specifically defined as the third element of the `nested_list`, and it is passed to the function `func_1`. The output of `func_1(item)` is assumed to be some iterable that will be combined with `flat_list`.

Since `flat_list` is affected by the extension, its previous contents will now include the results of `func_1(item)`. The values of `nested_list` and `item` remain unchanged. Therefore, we state the preconditions still valid after the code has been executed and reflect the change in `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third element in the list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`**.
