Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that flattens a given nested list structure, as required by the problem description. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle nested lists of any depth. It checks each item in the input list (`nested_list`). If an item is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that item to further flatten it. This allows the function to handle deep nesting correctly.

2. **Appending Non-List Items**: For items that are not lists, the function appends them directly to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all integers in the original nested structure are included in the final flat list.

3. **Returning the Result**: After processing all items, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains a single-level list of all integers extracted from the original nested list.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various combinations of nested lists, producing the intended flat output.

Overall, the implementation correctly matches the problem description by effectively flattening any nested list input, regardless of structure or depth.
