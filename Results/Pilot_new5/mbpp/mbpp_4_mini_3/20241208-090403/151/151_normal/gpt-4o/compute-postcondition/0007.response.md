According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, the loop can execute one more time for the second item. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, and if the first element `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, otherwise, `flat_list` contains `item` itself.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items. The next `item` will be the second element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 items, item is the second element in the list, flat_list contains the respective values based on the type of item.**
