To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the problem description.

The problem is to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, let's break down the provided code in `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

1. **Base Cases**: 
   - When `n == 0`, it correctly returns `2`.
   - When `n == 1`, it correctly returns `1`.

2. **Recursive Case**: 
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes `a` to `2` (L(0)) and `b` to `1` (L(1)), which are correct.
   - It then iteratively computes the next Lucas numbers based on the previous two numbers using the loop.

3. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n`, updating `a` and `b` as it goes. After the loop, `b` contains the value of L(n).

Now let's consider if there are any potential cases where this code might fail based on the problem description:

- **Testing with various values of n**:
  - For `n = 0`, returns `2` (correct).
  - For `n = 1`, returns `1` (correct).
  - For `n = 2`, calculates `L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3`, returns `3` (correct).
  - For `n = 3`, calculates `L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4`, returns `4` (correct).
  - For `n = 4`, calculates `L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7`, returns `7` (correct).
  - For `n = 5`, calculates `L(5) = L(4) + L(3) = 7 + 4 = 11`, returns `11` (correct).

After testing these base cases and additional numbers, it seems that the implementation correctly computes the n-th Lucas number as per the definition.

Since the program handles all cases correctly and follows the problem description without any errors or omissions, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
