To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of finding the nth Lucas number, we first need to recall the definition of Lucas numbers:

The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

The assertions given in the program are as follows:
- `assert func_1(9) == 76`
- `assert func_1(4) == 7`
- `assert func_1(3) == 4`

Next, we compute the expected Lucas numbers for the inputs used in the assertions:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
- L(3) = 2 + 1 = 3
- L(4) = 1 + 3 = 4
- L(5) = 3 + 4 = 7
- L(6) = 4 + 7 = 11
- L(7) = 7 + 11 = 18
- L(8) = 11 + 18 = 29
- L(9) = 18 + 29 = 47

Now, comparing these values with the assertions:
1. `func_1(9)` is expected to return 47, but it asserts that it equals 76. This is incorrect.
2. `func_1(4)` is expected to return 7, and the program returns 7, which is correct.
3. `func_1(3)` is expected to return 4, but the function returns 3, which is incorrect.

Since the program fails to correctly calculate the Lucas number for at least two cases (specifically for n = 9 and n = 3), the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

Thus, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the Lucas numbers based on the provided problem description.
