According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for values of `_` starting from 2 up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be increased by 1. Thus, it will become 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (since the loop runs from 2 to `n` inclusive). 

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
