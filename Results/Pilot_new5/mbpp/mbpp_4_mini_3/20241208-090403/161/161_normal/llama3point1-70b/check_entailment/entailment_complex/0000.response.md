Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to return the n-th Lucas number, but instead, it incorrectly returns Fibonacci numbers for n > 1. 

Here are the discrepancies:

1. **Lucas Number Definition**: The n-th Lucas number is defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Incorrect Implementation**: The program, in the `else` block for n > 1, implements the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence:
   - It initializes `a, b = 2, 1`, which are correct for L(0) and L(1).
   - However, the line `a, b = b, a + b` calculates Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers.

3. **Conclusion**: The logic in the loop is wrong; it should be updating `a` and `b` in accordance with the Lucas number formula (i.e., `b` should be updated to `a + b`, and `a` should take the previous value of `b`). 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not compute the n-th Lucas number correctly for n > 1.
