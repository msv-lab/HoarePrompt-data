After executing the code `a, b = b, a + b`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated. The previous value of `a` is 2, and the previous value of `b` is 1. Therefore, after execution:

- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 1.
- The new value of `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
