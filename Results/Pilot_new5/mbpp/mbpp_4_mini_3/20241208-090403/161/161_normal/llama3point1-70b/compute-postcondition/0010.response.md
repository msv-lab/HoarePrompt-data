The code `a, b = b, a + b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is updated to the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the result of `a + b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 3
- `_` is 3

We can calculate the new values:
- `a` will be assigned the current value of `b`, which is 3.
- `b` will be assigned the sum of the current values of `a` and `b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.

After executing the code, the updated values are:
- `a` is now 3
- `b` is now 4

The state of `n` and `_` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
