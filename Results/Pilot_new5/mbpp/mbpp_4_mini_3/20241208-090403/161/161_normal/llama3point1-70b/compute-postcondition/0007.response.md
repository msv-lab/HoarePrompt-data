According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts at 2 and ends at `n + 1`. Given that the initial state has `n` as a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, it ensures that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Therefore, at the beginning of the loop, the range will be from 2 to `n + 1`, which means the loop will execute if `n` is 2 or greater.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables of interest are `_`, which represents the current iteration value but does not affect the state, and `n`, which we know must be at least 2 for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2 (the first value in the range)**
