To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop code and the initial state.

The loop executes from 2 to `n`, inclusive, which means it will iterate `n - 1` times. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

Let's define the states of `a` and `b` throughout the iterations:

1. **Initial State**: `a` starts at 2, `b` starts at 1.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `_ = 2`: `a` becomes `1` (previous value of `b`), and `b` becomes `3` (2 + 1).
   - For `_ = 3`: `a` becomes `3`, and `b` becomes `4` (1 + 3).
   - For `_ = 4`: `a` becomes `4`, and `b` becomes `7` (3 + 4).

Continuing this process, we see that:
- At each iteration, `b` takes the value of the previous `b` + the previous `a`, and `a` simply takes the previous value of `b`.

After iterating through all `n - 1` times, the final values of `a` and `b` can be derived based on the Fibonacci-like progression.

The loop will end when `_` equals `n`. Thus, the final values can be represented as:
- `a` ends up being the value which is `F(n-1)`, where `F` is the Fibonacci sequence starting from `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`, and so on,
- `b` ends up being `F(n)`.

Therefore, if `n` is greater than 1, the output state after the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is the Fibonacci number at position `n-1`, `b` is the Fibonacci number at position `n`.**
