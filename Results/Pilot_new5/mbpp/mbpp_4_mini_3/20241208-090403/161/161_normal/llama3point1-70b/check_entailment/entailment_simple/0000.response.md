Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to compute the nth Lucas number, but it incorrectly computes Fibonacci numbers instead. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

In the annotated program, the sequence for `a` and `b` is computed as follows:

- `a` starts at 2 (L(0)) and `b` starts at 1 (L(1)), which is correct for the base cases.
- However, the loop computes the next numbers as `a + b`, which corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence, not Lucas numbers.

For example, if `n = 2`, the function will return `1`, which is the second Fibonacci number instead of `3`, which is the second Lucas number.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description to find the nth Lucas number.
