According to the code, the loop continues as long as the variable `_` is less than or equal to `n`. In the previous iteration, `_` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3. The loop iterates from 2 to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute one more time if `_` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `_` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 (because `n + 1` must be at least 4). In the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will become 4.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need:
- `n` must be at least 4 (to ensure the loop condition holds true).
- `_` will be 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4**
