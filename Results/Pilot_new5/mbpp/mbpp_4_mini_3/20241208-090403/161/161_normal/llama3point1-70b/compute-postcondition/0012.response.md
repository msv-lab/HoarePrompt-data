The values of `a` and `b` are updated with the tuple unpacking operation `a, b = b, a + b`. The previous values are `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. After the operation, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (which is 4), and `b` is assigned the value of `a + b` (which is 3 + 4 = 7). 

The variable `n` is not directly affected, so it remains with its previous constraint of being at least 4. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**.
