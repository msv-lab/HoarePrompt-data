The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values 2 and 1, respectively. The initial state of `n` is not affected by this assignment, so we maintain the condition that `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
