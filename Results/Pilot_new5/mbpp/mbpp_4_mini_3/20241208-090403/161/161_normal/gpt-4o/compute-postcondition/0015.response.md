The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. 

- If `n` is 0, the function returns the integer 2. 
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. 
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `b`, which is the sum of the last two values of `a` and `b`, with `a` being the value of `b` after `n - 1` iterations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the value of `n`: it returns 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, it returns the sum of the last two computed values in a sequence determined by previous iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns 2 if n is 0, returns 1 if n is 1, and returns the sum of the last two values of a and b for n >= 2.**
