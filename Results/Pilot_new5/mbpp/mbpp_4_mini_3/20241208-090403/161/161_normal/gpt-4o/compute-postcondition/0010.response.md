The code assigns new values to `a` and `b`. Specifically, `b` gets the old value of `b`, which is 2, and `a` gets the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`. The initial state shows `_` is 3, which does not affect the calculation. The final value of `a` will depend on its previous value, which is not specified, but we know it has been updated to `a + 2`. Therefore, the output should reflect the changes to `a` and `b`.

The new values are:
- `b` becomes 2 (unchanged).
- `a` becomes `a + 2 + 2`, which simplifies to `a + 4` (since the old `b` was 2).

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is updated to `a + 4`; `_` is 3; `b` is 2**
