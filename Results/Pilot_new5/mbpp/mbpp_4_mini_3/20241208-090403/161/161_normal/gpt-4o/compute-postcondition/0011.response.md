According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts at 2 and continues as long as `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `a` is updated to `a + 4`; `_` is 4; `b` is 2**
