The function `func_1` is supposed to find the nth Lucas number. A Lucas number is defined similarly to Fibonacci numbers, but starts with 2 and 1:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

Looking closely at the problem description, the function appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating Lucas numbers, as it handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` and applies the correct recurrence for `n >= 2`.

Now, let's evaluate the output hints provided, which state:
- The function returns 2 if `n` is 0,
- Returns 1 if `n` is 1,
- And returns the nth Fibonacci number for `n >= 2.

Here, we find a discrepancy: the output hints incorrectly state that the function returns the nth Fibonacci number for `n >= 2`, when in fact it should return the nth Lucas number. The implementation is correct for calculating Lucas numbers but the output hints mischaracterize what the function is doing for `n >= 2`.

This mischaracterization indicates that the function doesn't meet the requirements as per the output hints, which raises concerns about its correctness in the context of the problem description.

Given this discrepancy, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it fails to align with the output hints regarding the expected results for `n >= 2`.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function correctly calculates Lucas numbers but misaligns with the output hints, which claim it returns Fibonacci numbers for `n >= 2`, thus failing to completely satisfy the problem description as per the hints provided.
