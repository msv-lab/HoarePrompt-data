According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for values of `_` starting from 2 up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, meaning that the loop has run once, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to determine the values for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be increased by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is updated to `a + 2`; `_` is 3; `b` is 2**
