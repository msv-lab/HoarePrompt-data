The provided code is intended to compute the nth Lucas number. However, the final annotation incorrectly states that the function returns the nth Fibonacci number for n >= 2. This is a critical error since the function is supposed to return the nth Lucas number according to the problem description.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

The function correctly returns 2 for n = 0 and 1 for n = 1, but the logic in the loop is intended for Fibonacci numbers, which is not what the problem description requests.

Moreover, the assertions provided for testing the function are incorrect for Lucas numbers:
- `func_1(9) == 76` is incorrect as the 9th Lucas number is 76.
- However, the function does produce the correct Lucas number in this case.
- But for `func_1(4)`, which should return 7, it indeed returns 7, and for `func_1(3)`, it returns 4 as expected.

Overall, the function does return the correct Lucas numbers for the inputs given in the assertions. The confusion arises from the final annotation stating it computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers.

Therefore, I conclude that despite the misleading annotation regarding Fibonacci numbers, the actual logic of the code aligns with the Lucas number computation.

Correctness: **True**
