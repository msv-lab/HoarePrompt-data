To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we proceed as follows:

1. The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, hence it will execute `n - 1` times.
2. Each iteration updates `a` to the previous value of `b`, and `b` to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.
3. The initial values are `a = 2` and `b = 1`.

After executing the loop for `n - 1` times, we can derive the final values of `a` and `b`:

- On the first iteration, `a` takes the initial value of `b` (which is 1), and `b` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
- On the second iteration, `a` becomes 3 (the updated value of `b` from the previous iteration), and `b` becomes `1 + 3 = 4`.
- This continues until the loop has executed for `n - 1` times.

Ultimately, after the loop has completed, `a` will end up as the value of `b` from the last iteration, and `b` will end up as the sum of the last two values of `a` and `b`.

Assuming the loop executes `n - 1` times, `n` must be at least 2. Thus:

Output State: **`a` is the value of `b` after `n - 1` iterations, `b` is the sum of the last two values of `a` and `b`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
