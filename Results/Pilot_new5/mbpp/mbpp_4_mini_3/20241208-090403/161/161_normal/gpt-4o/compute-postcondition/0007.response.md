According to the code, the loop will execute for values from 2 to `n` (inclusive). The loop will run as long as `n` is at least 2, since the range starts at 2. Given that the state before the loop starts states that `n` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `_` will take on each value from 2 up to `n`, starting with `_` as 2. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `a` or `b` since they are not involved in the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2**
