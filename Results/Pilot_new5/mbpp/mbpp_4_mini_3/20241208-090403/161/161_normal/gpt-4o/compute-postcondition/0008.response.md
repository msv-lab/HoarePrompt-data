The operation `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates `a` and `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but `b` will take the value of its previous state, and `a` will be updated to the sum of its previous value and the previous value of `b`.

Since `_` is 2 and it appears that `_` is being used to represent `b` as its initial value could likely be `_`, we can assume:
- `b` starts as 2.

Thus,:
- The new value of `b` will be equal to its previous value, which is 2.
- The new value of `a` will be equal to the sum of its previous value and `b`. However, since the initial value of `a` is unknown, we denote it as `a`.

So we have:
- `a` becomes `a + 2`.
- `b` becomes `2`.

The output state should reflect these changes while maintaining the condition on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is updated to `a + 2`; `_` is 2; `b` is 2**
