The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. The right-hand side is evaluated first before any assignments are made. Here, `b` will take the current value of `b`, which is 2, and `a` will be updated to the sum of its previous value and the current value of `b`.

1. The initial value of `a` must be assessed. Since `a` is updated to `a + 4`, let's denote the previous value of `a` as `a_initial`. Therefore, the new value of `a` before the assignment occurs is `a_initial + 4`.

2. Then, we calculate the new value of `b`: it will be `a_initial + 4 + 2`.

3. After the assignment:
   - `b` becomes `2`.
   - `a` becomes `a_initial + 4 + 2`.

We still need to represent the initial state of `n`, which is not directly affected by the statements, and it remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `a` is equal to `a_initial + 6` (where `a_initial` is the value of `a` before update); `b` is 2; `_` is 4.**
