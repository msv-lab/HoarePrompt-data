To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and understand how it computes the nth Lucas number.

### Lucas Numbers
The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, let's evaluate the `func_1(n)` function:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - When `n == 0`, the function returns `2`, which is correct, as L(0) = 2.
   - When `n == 1`, the function returns `1`, which is correct, as L(1) = 1.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - When `n >= 2`, the function initializes `a` and `b` to `2` and `1`, respectively. It then uses a for loop to compute the values iteratively:
     - In each iteration, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of the sum of the previous `a` and `b`. This effectively calculates the Lucas numbers as per the definition.
   - After `n - 1` iterations, `b` will hold the value of L(n), which is then returned.

### Given Assertions:
The program has assertions that test the function:
- `func_1(9)` should return `76`, which is true since L(9) = 76.
- `func_1(4)` should return `7`, which is true since L(4) = 7.
- `func_1(3)` should return `4`, which is true since L(3) = 4.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- The function correctly implements the logic to compute the nth Lucas number for all non-negative integers n.
- The assertions provided in the code verify that the function behaves as expected for the specified cases.

Since the function fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all non-negative integers, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
