Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n >= 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The provided function `func_1(n)` handles these cases accurately:
- It correctly returns 2 for `n = 0`.
- It correctly returns 1 for `n = 1`.
- For all other values of `n`, it uses a loop to calculate the n-th Lucas number based on the previous two values, which is the correct approach.

I cannot find any potential edge cases or examples where the program would fail to meet the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
