Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It does so by converting the input list `nums` into a set to eliminate duplicates, sorting the unique numbers, and then returning the second smallest number if there are at least two unique numbers. 

The assertions provided in the code confirm that it works for various cases:

1. For the input `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique sorted numbers are `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-2`.
2. For the input `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique sorted numbers are `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-0.5`.
3. For the input `[2, 2]`, there are not enough unique numbers, so it correctly returns `None`.
4. For the input `[2, 2, 2]`, similar to the previous case, it returns `None` since there are no second unique numbers.

The function handles edge cases and works as intended based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all potential inputs.
