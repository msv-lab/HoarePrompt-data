Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where there are fewer than two unique numbers in the input list. For example, if the input is `[2, 2]` or `[2, 2, 2]`, the function correctly returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number. However, this is misleading because the problem statement requires finding the second smallest number, and returning `None` for inputs with duplicates does not align with the correct interpretation of the problem when considering a list of only one unique value. 

Additionally, the case when the input list is empty (e.g., `[]`) is not explicitly handled, which would lead to an `IndexError` when the function attempts to access `unique_nums[1]`. 

Therefore, since the function does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
