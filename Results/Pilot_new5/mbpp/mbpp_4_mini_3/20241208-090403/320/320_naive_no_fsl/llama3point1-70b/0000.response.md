To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The requirement is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list.

### Program Analysis
Hereâ€™s the implementation provided:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))  # Remove duplicates
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:        # Check if there are at least two unique numbers
        return None                  # Not enough numbers to find the second smallest
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]   # Sort and return the second smallest
```

### Check for Edge Cases
1. **Case with less than two unique numbers**: 
   - If the input list has only one unique number or is empty, the program correctly returns `None`.
   - Example: `func_1([1])` or `func_1([])` both return `None`, which is correct.

2. **Case with duplicates**:
   - The program converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, which is appropriate. 
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])` returns `2`, which is correct since `1` is the smallest and `2` is the second smallest.

3. **Typical case with distinct numbers**:
   - Example: `func_1([5, 1, 3, 2])` returns `2`, which is correct.

4. **Case with negative numbers**:
   - Example: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns `-2`, which is correct.

5. **Case with all identical numbers**:
   - Example: `func_1([4, 4, 4])` returns `None`, which is correct because there is no second smallest number.

6. **Performance for large lists**: 
   - Since the function first converts the list to a set, then sorts it, it handles larger lists correctly, but the performance could be affected for very large lists because of the sorting step.

### Conclusion
After reviewing various edge cases, the program behaves correctly in all scenarios relevant to the problem description. It correctly returns the second smallest unique number or `None` if there are not enough unique numbers.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**
