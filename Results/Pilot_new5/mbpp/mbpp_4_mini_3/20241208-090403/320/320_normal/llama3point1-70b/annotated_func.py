#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None because the current value of len(unique_nums) is less than 2, indicating there are not enough unique integers derived from nums.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `unique_nums`, which is derived from the list `nums` that contains at least two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns `None` if there are not at least two unique integers. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. If all elements in `nums` are the same, it will also return `None` since the unique list will have a length of less than 2.
