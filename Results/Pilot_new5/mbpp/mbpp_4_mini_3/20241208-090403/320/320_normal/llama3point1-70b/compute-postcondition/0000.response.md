The code creates a set from the list `nums`, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts it back to a list. The variable `unique_nums` will hold the list of unique integers from the original `nums` list. However, the specific contents of `unique_nums` depend on the original values in `nums`, which are not provided. Therefore, `unique_nums` will be a list containing the unique elements of `nums`, but we cannot specify the exact values.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
