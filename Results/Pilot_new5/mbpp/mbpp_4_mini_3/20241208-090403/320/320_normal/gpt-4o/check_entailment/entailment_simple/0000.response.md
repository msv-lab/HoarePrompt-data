Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. The issue lies in the handling of cases where the input list contains duplicate elements or fewer than two unique elements.

1. The problem description requires finding the second smallest number in a list. However, the program only returns the second unique number, which means it will ignore duplicates.
2. In the test cases:
   - `func_1([2, 2])` and `func_1([2, 2, 2])` return `None`, which suggests that the function interprets the lack of unique values as an invalid case instead of returning the second smallest number based on the original problem description. This is incorrect because the input lists contain only one unique number, so it should not return `None` without explicitly addressing the problem requirements.
3. The program does not account for cases where the second smallest number is a duplicate of the smallest number. For example, if the input is `[2, 2, 3]`, the second smallest would be `3`, but the program would incorrectly return `3` only if it were unique.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement to find the second smallest number from the original list, hence it is considered incorrect.
