Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description, which requires it to find the second smallest number in a list. The issue arises in the handling of lists where all elements are the same or where there are not at least two unique numbers. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. The program uses `set(nums)` to eliminate duplicates before sorting the numbers. This approach means that if all elements in `nums` are the same, the function will return `None`, which is correct according to its implementation but does not fulfill the expectation of finding the second smallest number because if there's no second unique number, it should not be considered valid input for finding the second smallest.

2. The assertions provided in the annotated program reflect this behavior. For example, `func_1([2, 2])` and `func_1([2, 2, 2])` both return `None`, which means the function is not finding a second smallest number, but rather indicating that it cannot do so because of the lack of unique numbers.

3. The problem description does not specify that the function should return `None` for cases where no valid second smallest number exists. This leads to confusion since the requirement is specifically to find the second smallest number, not to indicate an absence by returning `None`.

In conclusion, while the function handles some cases correctly, it fails to align with the problem description in cases where all numbers are the same or when not enough unique numbers exist in the list to determine a "second smallest" value. Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements set forth in the problem description.
