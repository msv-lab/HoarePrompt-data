The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers called `nums` that is guaranteed to have at least two elements. It extracts unique integers from this list, sorts them, and checks the count of unique integers. If there is more than one unique integer, the function returns the second unique integer from the sorted list. If there is only one unique integer present, it returns `None`. 

There are no edge cases related to the input length specified in the annotations, as the precondition states that `nums` will always have at least two elements. However, if all integers in `nums` are the same, it will still return `None`, which is a valid scenario not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the second unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers if there are at least two unique integers; otherwise, it returns None. **
