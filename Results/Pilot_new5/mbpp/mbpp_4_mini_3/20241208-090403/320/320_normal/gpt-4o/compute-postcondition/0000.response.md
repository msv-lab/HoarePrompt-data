The code creates a set from the list `nums` to remove duplicates, then sorts that set to produce a sorted list of unique integers. The variable `unique_nums` is assigned this new sorted list. The original list `nums` remains unchanged, and its previous state, which is a list of integers with at least two elements, is still valid. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is the sorted list of unique integers from `nums`.**
