To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` in relation to the requirement: the function should check if the string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Let's go through the code and its logic:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

### Logic Analysis:

1. The function slices the input string `s` to check for the presence of 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]`. This effectively ignores the first and last characters of the string.
2. If 'z' is found in that substring, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Test Cases Given:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` should return `True`: This is correct because 'z' is in the substring ignoring the first ('p') and last ('.') characters.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` should return `False`: Correct, as 'z' is at the start, which is ignored.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` should return `False`: Correct, as there is no 'z' in the string at all.

### Edge Case Consideration:

Let's consider additional edge cases:

1. **Input with 'z' at the start and end:**
   - `func_1('z')` should return `False`: The string is of length 1, so there are no characters to check between the start and end.
   - `func_1('zabc')` should return `False`: 'z' is at the start.
   - `func_1('abc z')` should return `False`: There is no 'z' in the middle.
   - `func_1('abcz')` should return `False`: 'z' is at the end.
   - `func_1(' az ')` should return `False`: 'z' is at the start.

2. **Input with multiple 'z's:**
   - `func_1('abcde z fgh')` should return `False`: There is no 'z' in the part of the string that is being checked.
   - `func_1('abczdefgz')` should return `True`: 'z' is in the middle, which is correct.

3. **Empty string:**
   - `func_1('')` should return `False`: An empty string is considered, and there are no characters to check.

### Conclusion:

After considering the above cases, we can conclude that the implementation of `func_1` correctly checks for the presence of 'z' in the allowed segment of the string, considering the conditions outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, there are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements. 

Correctness: **True**
