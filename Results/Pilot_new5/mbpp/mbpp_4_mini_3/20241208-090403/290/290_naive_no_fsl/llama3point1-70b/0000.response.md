Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when a word contains 'z' at the start or end. According to the problem description, 'z' should not be counted if it appears at the start or end of the word. However, the program's implementation does not differentiate between the placement of 'z' relative to the start and end of a word if the word is longer than one character. 

For example, consider the input string `"zebra"`. According to the problem description, it contains a 'z' at the start and thus should not return True. However, the current implementation will check the substring `word[1:-1]` which gives us `"ebr"` and does not contain 'z', resulting in a False return. 

Furthermore, for the input `"buzz"`, the function will return True because it finds 'z' within `"uz"` (the substring excluding the first and last characters), even though there's a 'z' at the end which is not allowed.

Therefore, there are cases where the program does not work as expected, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
