The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters. It returns `True` if 'z' is found in that substring and `False` otherwise. If the string has a length of 1, the function will always return `False` since there are no characters to check between the first and last.
