#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length of at least 1.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the character 'z' is present in the substring of 's' excluding the first and last characters.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, and the substring of `s` from index 1 to the second-to-last index does not contain the character 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters. It returns `True` if 'z' is found in that substring and `False` otherwise. If the string has a length of 1, the function will always return `False` since there are no characters to check between the first and last.
