Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` with a length of at least 1 as input.
  
2. **Checking for 'z'**: The line `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` effectively checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last character of `s`. This is exactly what the problem statement requires.

3. **Return Values**: If 'z' is found in the specified substring, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This aligns with the requirement to return `True` if 'z' appears in the string (except at the start and end) and `False` otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. If the string has a length of 1, the substring `s[1:-1]` would be empty (as there are no characters to check), and thus the function will return `False`, which is the expected behavior.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program also validate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases:
   - `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is indeed present in the substring "pythonzabc" (between 'p' and '.').
   - `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
   - `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False` because there is no 'z' in the substring " lang ".

Thus, the function satisfies all conditions set by the problem description, making the overall implementation correct.
