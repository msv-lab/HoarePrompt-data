Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z', excluding the first and last characters of the string. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Substring Check**: The program uses `s[1:-1]` to create a substring that omits the first and last characters of the string `s`. This directly aligns with the requirement to check for 'z' except at the start and end of the word.

2. **Conditional Logic**: The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` checks if 'z' is present within the substring. If it is found, the function returns `True`, which is the expected behavior as per the problem description.

3. **Return Value**: If 'z' is not found in the specified substring, the function correctly returns `False`, indicating the absence of 'z' in the required portion of the string.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions are correctly structured:
   - `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring `ythonzabc`.
   - `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
   - `func_1('  lang  .')` also returns `False` since there is no 'z' in the substring ` lang `.

Thus, the program satisfies all conditions presented in the problem description for any potential case.
