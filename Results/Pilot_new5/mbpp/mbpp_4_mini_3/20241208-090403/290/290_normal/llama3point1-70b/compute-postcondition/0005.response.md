According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `words`. If the list has more words, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `s`, and `word` is the first word in `words`. Since `word` has a length of 1 or does not contain the letter 'z' in its substring that excludes the first and last characters, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `words` must have at least one more word following the current `word`. If the current `word` is the first in `words`, then the next `word` would be the second in the list. 

Thus, the next state should reflect that `word` is now the second word in `words`, and `words` must have at least 2 words for the loop to continue. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list of words that must have at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in `words`**
