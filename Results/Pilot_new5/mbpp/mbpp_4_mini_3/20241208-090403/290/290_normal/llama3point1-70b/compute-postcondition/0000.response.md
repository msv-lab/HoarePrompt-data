The variable `words` is assigned the result of `s.split()`, which splits the string `s` into a list of words based on whitespace. The contents of `s` can be any characters, so `words` will now hold a list of those characters separated by spaces. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string that may contain any characters, and `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain any characters; `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `s`.**
