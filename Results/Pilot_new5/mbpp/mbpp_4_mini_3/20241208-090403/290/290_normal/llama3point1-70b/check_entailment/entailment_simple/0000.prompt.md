You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain any characters.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `s` is an empty string, `words` is an empty list, and no return occurs. If `s` contains words, and at least one word of length greater than 1 contains 'z' in its internal characters, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the conditions for returning True are not met, as either `s` is an empty string or there are no words containing 'z' with length greater than 1.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
