According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 3 words, the loop will execute again for the third word. At the end of the last iteration, `words` contains at least 2 words, and `word` is the second word in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 words, and `word` should then be set to the third word in the list.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in `words`**
