Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the issue arises with the following points:

1. The function checks for the presence of 'z' only in words that have a length greater than 1. This is correct according to the problem description. However, it fails to return `False` for words that may be a single character long and contain 'z'. The problem description does not explicitly mention that words of length 1 should be ignored; hence, the implementation may potentially overlook cases that could lead to misinterpretation based on the intent of the problem.

2. The program does indeed check only for 'z' in the internal characters of the words (i.e., it excludes the first and last characters). While this part of the implementation aligns with the problem statement, the overall logic can lead to confusion and could potentially return incorrect results if the input string has punctuation or special characters.

3. The annotations mention that if `s` is empty or no words meet the criteria, the function returns `False`. However, the condition for checking if 'z' is present only checks if it is in the internal characters of words with length greater than 1. If a single character word is 'z', the function would not return `True`, but it does not explicitly state that 'z' at the start or end is to be excluded.

The program's logic is sound for checking the presence of 'z' but does not account for every potential edge case as required by the problem description. Thus, it does not fully adhere to the conditions specified, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
