Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and returns `True` if any word has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its internal characters. If `s` is empty or no words meet these criteria, the function returns `False`. It does not account for cases where words contain 'z' only at the beginning or end, nor does it handle punctuation or special characters in the words. **
