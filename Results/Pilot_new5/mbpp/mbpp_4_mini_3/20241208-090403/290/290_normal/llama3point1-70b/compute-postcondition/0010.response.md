Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in `words`. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is present in the substring of `word` from the second to the second-last character, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
