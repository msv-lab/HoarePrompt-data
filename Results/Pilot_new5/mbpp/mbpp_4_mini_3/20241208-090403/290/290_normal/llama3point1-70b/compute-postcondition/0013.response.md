The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string that may contain any characters. After executing the function body, the function has the following behavior: 

- Case 1: If the first word in the list 'words' has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its substring (excluding the first and last characters), the function returns `True`.
- Case 2: The program returns `True` (the specific condition for this case is unspecified).
- Case 3: The program returns `True` (the specific condition for this case is unspecified).
- Case 4: If the input string `s` is empty or if there are no words containing 'z' with a length greater than 1, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to analyze the input string `s` and return `True` under certain conditions related to words containing the character 'z', or `False` if the conditions for `True` are not met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, and returns True under specific conditions regarding words containing the character 'z', or False if the input string is empty or conditions are not met.**
