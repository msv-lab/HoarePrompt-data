Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of any word. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Splitting the String**: The program uses `s.split()` to break the string into words, which is necessary to analyze each word individually.

2. **Iterating Through Words**: The `for` loop iterates through each word in the list of words obtained from the split operation.

3. **Length Check**: The condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that only words longer than one character are considered. This is crucial as the problem specifies to check for 'z' only in the internal characters of words.

4. **Checking for 'z'**: The check `'z' in word[1:-1]` correctly determines if 'z' is present in the middle of the word (i.e., between the first and last character).

5. **Returning True or False**: The function returns `True` if any word satisfies the condition (contains 'z' internally). If no such word exists, it returns `False`.

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description for all relevant cases.
