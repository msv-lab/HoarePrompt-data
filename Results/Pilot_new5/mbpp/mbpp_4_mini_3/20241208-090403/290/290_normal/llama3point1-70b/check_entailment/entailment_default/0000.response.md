Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description and output hints.

**Problem description:** Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

**Initial Assessment:**
- The function splits the input string `s` into words.
- It checks each word to see if its length is greater than 1 and if the character 'z' is present in the substring of the word that excludes the first and last characters.
- If any word meets these criteria, the function returns `True`. If none do, it returns `False`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. A string with only one character (e.g., "z" or "a") should return `False` since there are no words of length greater than 1.
2. A string with words that contain 'z' only at the start or end (e.g., "zoo" or "az") should also return `False`, and the code seems to handle this correctly as it checks the internal characters only.
3. Punctuation or special characters adjacent to 'z' (e.g., "zoo!" or "a!z") should also be handled correctly.

**Output Hints:**
- The hints state that the function checks for 'z' in words longer than one character and returns `True` if found in the internal characters.
- It also specifies that it does not account for cases where 'z' might appear only on the boundaries (start or end) of the words and notes that it does not handle punctuation or special characters.

**Agreement with Output Hints:**
The output hints mention that the function does not account for punctuation or special characters, which could lead to cases where 'z' is incorrectly interpreted as being part of the internal characters. For instance, a string like "a z!" would return `False`, which is correct. However, if special characters are unexpectedly included in words, the logic might fail without explicit handling.

**Conclusion:**
While the program does correctly implement the described functionality for most scenarios, it fails to explicitly outline how punctuation or special characters impact the checking process, particularly given the prompt's mention of words. 

In particular, consider a case such as `"azb zcd z"`:
- The first word `"azb"` would be evaluated as having 'z' in the internal characters, resulting in `True`. However, this would be misleading since the 'z' is at the beginning of the string.

Given that edge case and the output hints, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
