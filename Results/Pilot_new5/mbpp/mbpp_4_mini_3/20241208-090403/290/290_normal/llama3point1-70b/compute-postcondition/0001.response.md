To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop. The loop iterates over `words`, which is derived from splitting the string `s`. 

1. The loop will execute if `words` contains at least one element. This means the string `s` must not be empty; otherwise, `words` will be an empty list.
2. Additionally, we need to ensure that `word` can reference the first element in the `words` list during the first iteration.

Thus, the conditions that need to be met are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string to ensure that `words` contains at least one word.
- At the start of the loop, `word` will refer to the first element in `words`.

In summary, the adjustments needed for the state before the loop are:
- Ensure `s` is a non-empty string.
- Set `word` to the first word in the `words` list.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list of words obtained from splitting `s`, `word` is the first word in `words`**.
