Correctness: **False**.

The function does not correctly handle cases where there are spaces or special characters at the beginning or end of the string. For example:

- `func_1('zabc')` should return `False` because the 'z' is at the start of the string, but the current implementation would return `True` since 'z' is present in the substring from index 1 to -1 (which includes the 'a', 'b', and 'c').
- Similarly, `func_1('.z')` or `func_1('z')` should return `False`, but the current implementation doesn't handle these edge cases correctly.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not behave as specified in the problem description.
