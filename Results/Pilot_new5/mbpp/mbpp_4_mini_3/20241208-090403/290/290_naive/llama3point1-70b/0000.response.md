Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Specifically, if the string is a single character "z", the program would return `False`, which is incorrect because it should simply return `False` without any additional checks.

For example, consider the input:

- Input: "z"
  
The program checks the length of the word and finds it to be 1, so it does not check for 'z' in the substring `word[1:-1]`, and returns `False`. However, since the word only contains 'z' and it is at the start and end, the correct behavior should also return `False`, but the logic is misleading and relies on the length check alone which could lead to misunderstanding.

A case that demonstrates this issue:
- Input: "azb"
  
The word "azb" contains 'z' in the middle, so the program will return `True`. However, if we have an input like "zz" where the 'z' is at both the start and end, the program will return `False`, which is correct, but the general logic could fail to cover other edge cases correctly like 'z' standing alone or multiple 'z's. 

Thus, the logic for checking and the flow of the program could lead to confusion and incorrect results in certain scenarios, which means the program does not satisfy the problem requirements fully.
