To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we start by evaluating the code and checking for potential edge cases.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that finds the shared elements from two given lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
```

### Output hints:
The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted tuple of the unique common elements present in both lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program converts both input lists into sets and uses the intersection operator `&` to find common elements. This is a valid approach for identifying shared elements.
2. The result is then sorted and returned as a tuple, which also aligns with the problem requirements.
3. The function seems to handle duplicate entries correctly by converting the lists to sets, ensuring that only unique elements are considered.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function should return an empty tuple. This is handled correctly since the intersection of two empty sets is an empty set.
2. **No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements between the lists, the function should return an empty tuple. The output hint states this correctly.
3. **Identical Lists**: If both lists are identical, the function should return a tuple containing all elements of the list sorted and unique, which is also handled correctly.
4. **Different Types**: If the lists contain different types (e.g., strings and integers) that do not match, the function should return an empty tuple. The function handles this scenario since the intersection of sets with different types will yield no common elements.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints correctly describe the behavior of the function. They specify that the function returns a sorted tuple of unique common elements and that it returns an empty tuple when there are no common elements, which agrees with the functionality of the code.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program handles the problem description effectively, including all identified edge cases, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies and returns shared elements from two lists, including handling edge cases like empty lists and lists with no common elements.
