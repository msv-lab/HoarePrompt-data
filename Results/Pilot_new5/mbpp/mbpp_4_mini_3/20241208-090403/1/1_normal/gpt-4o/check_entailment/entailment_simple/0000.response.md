Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Shared Elements**: The function `func_1` is designed to find shared elements between two lists. It uses the intersection of two sets created from the input lists (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) to identify common elements. This directly addresses the requirement of finding shared elements from the given two lists.

2. **Return Type**: The function returns a sorted tuple of the common elements, which is a reasonable choice given that the problem does not specify the return type. Returning a tuple allows the result to be easily used in contexts that require an immutable sequence of the shared elements.

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that validate the functionality of `func_1`. Each assertion checks if the function returns the correct shared elements for given pairs of input lists. The expected outputs in the assertions match the outputs produced by the function, confirming its correctness.

4. **Handling Different Element Types**: The function can handle any type of elements in the lists since it uses sets, which can contain various data types, as long as they are hashable. 

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description, successfully identifying shared elements and returning them in the specified format. Thus, it is correct.
