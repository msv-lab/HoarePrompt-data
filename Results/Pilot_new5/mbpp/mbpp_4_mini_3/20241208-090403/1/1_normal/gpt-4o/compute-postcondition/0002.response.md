The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that can contain any type of elements. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted tuple containing the common elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a sorted tuple of the elements that are common to both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted tuple of the common elements present in both lists.**
