The variable `common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection of `list1` and `list2`, which means it contains only the elements that are present in both lists. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the creation of `common_elements` based on the contents of `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any type of elements; `common_elements` is the set of elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.**
