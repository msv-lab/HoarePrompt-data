Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description by accurately finding the shared elements between the two lists. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function `func_1` achieves this:

1. **Input Handling:** The function takes two input parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both expected to be lists (or tuples, as the assertions indicate), containing elements of any type.

2. **Finding Common Elements:** The line `common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)` converts both lists into sets and calculates the intersection. This effectively identifies all unique elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

3. **Sorting and Returning:** The function then returns `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. By converting the set of common elements back into a sorted tuple, it ensures that the result is not only unique but also ordered. If there are no common elements, the result will be an empty tuple, which is a correct behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Assertions:** The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function with various test cases, confirming that it returns the expected results.

Overall, the function logically follows the problem description and handles all specified cases correctly, making it a valid implementation for finding shared elements in two lists.
