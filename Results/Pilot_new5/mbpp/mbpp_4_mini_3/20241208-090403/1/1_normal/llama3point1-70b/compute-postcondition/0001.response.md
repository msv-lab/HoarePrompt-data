The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two lists, meaning it includes only the elements that are present in both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a tuple that contains the common elements found in both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters test_tup1 and test_tup2, both of which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two lists.**
