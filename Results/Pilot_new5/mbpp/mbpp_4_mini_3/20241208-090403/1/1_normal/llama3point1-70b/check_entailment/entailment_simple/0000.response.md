Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it is designed to return a tuple containing the shared elements from two lists. However, the function's output format is incorrect according to the specification that implies the return type should be a list (given that the problem description mentions "elements from the given two lists"). 

The primary issue is that while the program correctly finds the shared elements using set intersection, it returns the result as a tuple instead of a list. According to the problem description, the output should ideally be in the same format as the input (lists). Therefore, the function should return a list instead of a tuple to align with the expectations set by the problem description. 

Moreover, the use of sets means that the function will lose any duplicate elements from the original lists, which may not align with some interpretations of the problem description if it implies maintaining the original list structure and properties. 

Thus, the function does not conform to the requirements of the problem description.
