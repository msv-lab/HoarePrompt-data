Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the shared elements between them. This is achieved by converting both lists to sets, using the intersection operator (`&`) to find the common elements, and then converting the resulting set back into a tuple.

The function handles all potential cases as follows:
- If both lists have common elements, it returns those elements as a tuple.
- If there are no common elements, it correctly returns an empty tuple, as specified in the annotations.
- The use of sets ensures that only unique elements are considered when finding the intersection, which aligns with the requirement of returning unique shared elements.

The overall logic and handling of edge cases are consistent with the problem description, ensuring that the program meets its requirements.
