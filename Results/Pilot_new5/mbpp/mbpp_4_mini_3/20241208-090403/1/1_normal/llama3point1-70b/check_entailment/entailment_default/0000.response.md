To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and output hints:

**Problem description:** The task is to write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements that are present in both lists, effectively giving the intersection of the two lists. If there are no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function takes two lists as input and uses a set operation to find the intersection of the two lists. This is a standard and efficient way to find shared elements between two collections.
2. The output is correctly returned as a tuple, as specified in the problem description.
3. The function handles the case where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the description.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- The function should correctly handle cases where:
  - One or both lists are empty. In such cases, the function should return an empty tuple.
  - The lists contain duplicate elements. The use of sets ensures that only unique shared elements are included.
  - The lists contain common elements in different orders.

### Output Hints Validation:
- The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the program. The hints mention that the function returns a tuple of unique elements found in both lists, which matches the set intersection operation performed in the code.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement and matches the output hints.

Since I cannot find any edge case where the program fails to meet the problem description and the output hints are consistent with the program's implementation:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly returns a tuple of shared elements for all potential cases, including when lists are empty or contain duplicates.
