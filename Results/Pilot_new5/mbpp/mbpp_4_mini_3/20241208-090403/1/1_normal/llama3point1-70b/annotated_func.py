#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two lists test_tup1 and test_tup2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements that are present in both lists, effectively giving the intersection of the two lists. If there are no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
