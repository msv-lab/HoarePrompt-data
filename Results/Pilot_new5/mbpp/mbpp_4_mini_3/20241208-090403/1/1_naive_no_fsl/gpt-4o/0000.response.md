Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists. It converts the input lists to sets and uses the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements. The resulting set is then sorted and returned as a tuple.

The assertions provided as test cases check various scenarios, including:
1. Two lists with some common elements.
2. Two lists where the order of elements is different.
3. Two lists with multiple common elements.

The function passes all these assertions and correctly handles the following potential edge cases:
- If either of the input lists is empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is the expected outcome.
- The function also handles cases with duplicate elements by converting lists to sets, ensuring that only unique common elements are returned.

Since I cannot think of any input or edge case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, it is correct.
