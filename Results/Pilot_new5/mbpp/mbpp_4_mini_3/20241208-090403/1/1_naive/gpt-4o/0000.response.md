Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies shared elements between the two lists provided in the problem description. It uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists, which ensures that only unique shared elements are returned. The result is then sorted and converted back to a tuple, as required by the description.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function works correctly for the input cases given:

1. For input `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, the common elements are `(4, 5)`.
2. For input `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)`, the common elements are `(3, 4)`.
3. For input `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)`, the common elements are `(13, 14)`.

Since the program accurately handles the examples given and the logic is sound for identifying shared elements in general, it is deemed correct.
