Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly finds the shared elements from two given lists by converting them to sets and using the intersection operator `&`. This approach effectively handles various potential cases:

1. If both lists are empty, the result is an empty tuple, which is expected.
2. If one list is empty and the other is not, the result is also an empty tuple, aligning with the requirement to find shared elements.
3. If there are no shared elements between the lists, the program returns an empty tuple, which is correct.
4. If there are shared elements, the function returns them as a tuple without duplicates, which is consistent with the problem description.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the program's logic fails to produce the correct result, the implementation is deemed correct.
