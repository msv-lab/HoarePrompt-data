Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to compute the angle of a complex number. It uses the `cmath.phase` function, which accurately computes the phase (or angle) of a complex number given its real and imaginary components. 

Here’s why the code is correct in every case:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. 

2. **Complex Number Creation**: It constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex()` function, allowing for a straightforward representation of the complex number.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The `cmath.phase()` function returns the angle (in radians) of the complex number, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code correctly handles various edge cases:
   - For a complex number with zero real and imaginary parts `(0, 0)`, the angle is defined as 0 radians.
   - For positive or negative imaginary values with a zero real part, it correctly returns either π/2 or -π/2 radians.
   - The function can handle both positive and negative real parts, covering all quadrants of the complex plane.

Since the program works correctly for all potential cases outlined in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
