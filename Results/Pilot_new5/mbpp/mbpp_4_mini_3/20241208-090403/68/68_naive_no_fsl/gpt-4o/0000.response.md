To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that the function correctly computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number for all possible edge cases.

The program uses the `cmath.phase()` function, which computes the phase of a complex number. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number, constructs the complex number using Python's built-in `complex()` function, and then returns the phase.

Let's analyze the assertions provided in the code:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` should return `1.5707963267948966`, which is the phase for the complex number `0 + 1j`. This is correct as the angle is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
   
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` should return `0.4636476090008061`, which is the phase for the complex number `2 + 1j`. This is correct as the angle can be computed using \( \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \).
   
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` should return `1.5707963267948966`, which is the phase for the complex number `0 + 2j`. This is again correct as the angle is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Now, let's consider additional edge cases and potential inputs:

- The function should also correctly handle the case when both the real and imaginary parts are zero, e.g., `func_1(0, 0)`. The phase of the complex number `0 + 0j` is undefined. In most mathematical contexts, this can be treated as returning `0` or `None`, but the current implementation will return `0.0` since `cmath.phase(0)` is defined to be `0.0`.

- If the real part is negative, such as `func_1(-1, 0)`, the function should return `3.141592653589793` (or `math.pi`), indicating that the angle is 180 degrees.

- Further edge cases include complex numbers lying on the negative imaginary axis, such as `func_1(0, -1)`, which should return `-1.5707963267948966`.

Based on this analysis, the existing function implementation handles typical cases but fails to address the scenario of the zero complex number, which is generally considered to be undefined.

Thus, since the program does not handle every potential case correctly, the correctness evaluation is as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not correctly handle the case of `func_1(0, 0)`, where the angle of a complex number with both real and imaginary parts as zero is undefined.
