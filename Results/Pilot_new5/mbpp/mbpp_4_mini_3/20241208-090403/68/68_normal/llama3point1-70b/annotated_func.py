#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number 'complex_num' which is equal to 'real + imag*j'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and returns the phase (or angle) of the complex number formed by `real + imag*j`. There are no edge cases to handle as the input types are not restricted, and valid floating-point numbers will always yield a valid phase.
