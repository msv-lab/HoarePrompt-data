Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It constructs a complex number using these parts and then returns the phase (or angle) of that complex number using `cmath.phase`.

The phase of a complex number is defined mathematically as the angle formed by the complex number in the complex plane, which is precisely what the function is intended to compute. The program does not have any edge cases that would cause it to fail, as it operates correctly for all valid floating-point inputs to compute the angle of a complex number.

Thus, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential cases.
