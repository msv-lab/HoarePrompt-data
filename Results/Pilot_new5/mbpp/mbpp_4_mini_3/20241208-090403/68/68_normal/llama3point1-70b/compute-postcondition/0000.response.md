The variable `complex_num` is assigned the value of a complex number created from `real` and `imag`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. The value of `complex_num` will be a complex number of the form `real + imag*j`, where `j` is the imaginary unit in Python.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is equal to `real + imag*j`**.
