Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function that takes two floating-point numbers (representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number) and returns the angle (or phase) of that complex number.

Here’s a breakdown of how the program satisfies the problem description:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. It constructs a complex number using Python’s built-in `complex` function, which combines the real and imaginary parts.
3. The program then uses `cmath.phase`, which computes the angle (or phase) of the complex number in radians.
4. This angle is returned as the output of the function.

Since the implementation accurately computes the angle of a complex number, it fully aligns with the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential valid inputs (i.e., any floating-point values for `real` and `imag`).
