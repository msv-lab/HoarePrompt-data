Functionality: ** The function accepts two floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and returns the phase (or angle) of the complex number formed by `real + imag*j`. There are no edge cases to handle as the input types are not restricted, and valid floating-point numbers will always yield a valid phase. **
