The provided function `func_1` is designed to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary components. 

Upon initial inspection, the code appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description, which requires returning the angle of a complex number represented by the given `real` and `imag` parts. The use of `cmath.phase` is appropriate for calculating the phase of the complex number.

The output hints clarify that the function accepts two floating-point numbers and returns the phase of the complex number formed by `real + imag*j`. The hints also mention that there are no edge cases to handle, as valid floating-point inputs will always provide a valid phase output.

However, we should consider potential edge cases:
1. **Zero Input**: If both `real` and `imag` are zero (`real = 0.0` and `imag = 0.0`), the phase of the complex number is undefined. This is because the complex number `0 + 0j` does not point in any direction, leading to a mathematical ambiguity in defining the phase.

The output hints state, "there are no edge cases to handle," which overlooks this case. Since the phase is not defined for the zero complex number, the function does not fully meet the problem's requirement for all potential inputs.

Thus, upon considering the potential edge case of a zero complex number, we conclude that the function does not correctly handle every possible scenario.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle the case when both input parameters are zero, which results in an undefined phase angle for the complex number `0 + 0j`.
