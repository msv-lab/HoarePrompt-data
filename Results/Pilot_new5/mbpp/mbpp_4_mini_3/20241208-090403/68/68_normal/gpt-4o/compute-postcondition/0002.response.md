The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are real numbers (which can be floats or integers). The function calculates the phase angle of the complex number formed by the given `real` and `imag` values, represented as `complex(real, imag)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `real` and `imag`, and return the phase angle of the complex number they represent. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase angle of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`.**
