`complex_number` is assigned the value of `complex(real, imag)`, where `real` and `imag` are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The states of `real` and `imag` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, and `complex_number` is equal to `complex(real, imag)`.

Output State: **`real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_number` is equal to `complex(real, imag)`**.
