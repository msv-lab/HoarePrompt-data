Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that computes the angle (phase) of a complex number. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the expected input for constructing a complex number.

2. Inside the function, the complex number is created using Python's built-in `complex` function: `complex(real, imag)`. This correctly represents a complex number in the form \( real + imag \cdot i \).

3. The function then returns the phase (angle) of this complex number using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`. The `cmath.phase` function calculates the angle in radians, which is precisely what the problem description requires.

4. The assertions following the function definition verify that the function produces the expected outputs for given inputs, further confirming the functionality against known correct values.

Since the program correctly calculates the angle of a complex number as specified in the problem description and handles various cases (as shown in the assertions), we conclude that the implementation is correct.
