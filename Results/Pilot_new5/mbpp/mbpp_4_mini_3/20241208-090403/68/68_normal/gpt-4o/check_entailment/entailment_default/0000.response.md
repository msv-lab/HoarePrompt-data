The provided Python program is intended to compute the phase angle of a complex number constructed from two parameters: `real` and `imag`. The function makes use of the `cmath.phase` function, which correctly computes the phase angle of the complex number.

The initial assessment based solely on the problem description indicates that the function should handle two parameters, which can be either floats or integers. It constructs a complex number and returns the angle in radians.

However, upon further examination, the output hints mention that the function "does not handle any exceptions or edge cases, such as invalid input types," and it "assumes that the input values are valid real numbers." This implies that the function does not handle cases where the input values are not valid types (e.g., strings or None) or out-of-bounds inputs, which could potentially lead to runtime errors.

Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function constructs a complex number correctly and returns the phase angle. However, they do highlight the lack of exception handling, which is a significant oversight since the function might crash with invalid inputs.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to its failure to handle invalid input types properly.

Correctness: **False**.
