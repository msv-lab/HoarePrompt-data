Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function uses Python’s `complex` function to create a complex number from these parameters, and then utilizes `cmath.phase` to compute the angle (or phase) of the complex number.

Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts both integers and floats as input for the real and imaginary parts, which aligns with the typical use cases of complex numbers.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: The program constructs a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`, which is a correct way to represent complex numbers in Python.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The use of `cmath.phase` correctly computes the angle of the complex number, returning the result in radians, which is appropriate.

4. **Validation with Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with specific complex numbers and check if the output is close to the expected phase values within a tolerance. This further reassures that the function behaves as intended for the provided test cases.

Overall, since the function performs all required operations as described in the problem statement and passes the assertions, it can be concluded that it is correct.
