#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers (floats or integers).
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle of the complex number formed by 'real' and 'imag' values, represented as complex(real, imag)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which can be either floats or integers. It constructs a complex number from these parameters and returns the phase angle of the complex number. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases, such as invalid input types, and assumes that the input values are valid real numbers.
