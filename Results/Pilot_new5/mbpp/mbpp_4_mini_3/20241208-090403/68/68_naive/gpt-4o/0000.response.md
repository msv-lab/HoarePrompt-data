Correctness: **False**.

The program provided appears to implement the function to compute the angle (phase) of a complex number correctly and uses the `cmath.phase` function. However, it does not handle the case where both the real and imaginary parts are zero (i.e., when the complex number is `0 + 0j`). In this case, the function would typically return undefined behavior since the phase of zero is not defined.

For example, calling `func_1(0, 0)` would return a phase value, but mathematically, the phase of the zero complex number should be considered undefined.

Thus, this is a potential case where the program does not adhere to the problem description.
