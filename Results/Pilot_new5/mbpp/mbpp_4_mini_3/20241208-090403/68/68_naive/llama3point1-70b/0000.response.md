Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the angle (or phase) of a complex number based on its real and imaginary components. The use of the `cmath.phase()` function is appropriate, as it computes the angle in radians correctly for all possible complex numbers. 

Here's the breakdown of the function:

1. It takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. It creates a complex number using the built-in `complex()` function.
3. It returns the phase (angle) using `cmath.phase()`.

The function handles all potential edge cases, such as:
- Zero values for both `real` and `imag` (the angle will be 0).
- Positive and negative values for both `real` and `imag` (the angle will be calculated correctly based on the quadrant).

Since the logic is sound and adheres to the problem description for all potential inputs, the conclusion is that the implementation is correct.
