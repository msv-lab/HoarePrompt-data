The variable `result` is updated by adding `char` to its current value. The variable `char` is defined as the character at index `i + 1` of the string `s`. Given that the length of `s` is greater than `i + 1`, `char` is valid and can be appended to `result`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the character at index `i + 1`, `result` is updated to include `char`, and the length of `s` is greater than `i + 1.**
