Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, meaning that any sequence of lowercase letters should be eliminated from the input string. 

However, the provided program only collects uppercase characters from the input string `s` and returns them, effectively ignoring all lowercase characters but not removing them as substrings. For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HW" if the lowercase letters are removed, but the function would actually return "HW" while still leaving the lowercase letters in the original string.

Therefore, the program fails to fulfill the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from the given string, which is the primary objective of the function.

In conclusion, the program does not align with the problem description, as it does not remove lowercase substrings but rather extracts and returns uppercase characters.
