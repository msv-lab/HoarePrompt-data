The value of `result` is updated to include `char`, which is the next character in the string `s`. The content of `result` changes by adding `char` to it, while `s` and `char` remain unaffected in terms of value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is the previous value of `result` concatenated with `char`, `char` is the next character in `s`.**
