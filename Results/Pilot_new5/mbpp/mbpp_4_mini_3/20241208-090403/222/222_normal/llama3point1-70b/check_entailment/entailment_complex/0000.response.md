Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function must remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided code only retains uppercase characters from the string `s` and constructs a new string from those characters. It does not address lowercase substrings or remove them as required.

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the program would return "HW", which is not the intended functionality of removing lowercase substrings. The expected behavior would be to remove characters such as "e", "l", "o", and "r", resulting in the string "H W".

Thus, the program does not accomplish what the problem description asks for, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
