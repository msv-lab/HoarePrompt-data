`result` is updated by concatenating `char`, which is the first character of `s`. Since `char` is an uppercase character and `result` was initially an empty string, `result` will now be equal to `char`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `result` is equal to `char`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is an uppercase character.**
