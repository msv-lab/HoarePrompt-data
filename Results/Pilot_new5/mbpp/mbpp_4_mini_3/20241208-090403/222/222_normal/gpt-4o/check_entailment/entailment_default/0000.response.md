The provided program is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string by returning only the uppercase characters. 

Examining the code, the function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, checking if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`. It joins these uppercase characters into a new string, which is then returned. 

The problem description requires that lowercase substrings be removed, which aligns with the functionality of returning only uppercase characters. However, the program fails to address the situation where the input string does not contain any uppercase letters. In such cases, the function should return an empty string, which is in accordance with the output hints. 

Now, looking at the output hints: they state that if there are no uppercase characters in `s`, the function will return an empty string. This is indeed what the code does, thus confirming consistency with the hints.

However, a potential edge case to consider is when the input string is empty. The program will also correctly return an empty string in this case, so it handles that scenario properly as well.

After reviewing all cases, it appears that the function meets the problem description and the output hints without any inconsistencies or missing logic.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly filters out all lowercase characters and returns only uppercase characters. It also appropriately handles the case of empty strings and strings without uppercase characters by returning an empty string in those instances, as confirmed by the output hints.
