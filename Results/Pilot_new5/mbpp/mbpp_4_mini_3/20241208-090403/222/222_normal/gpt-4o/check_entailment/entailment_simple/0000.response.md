Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program only removes lowercase characters and retains uppercase characters. 

For example, for the input 'PYTHon', the expected output based on the problem description would be 'PYTH', which matches the function's output. However, the problem description implies removing any contiguous lowercase substrings (which could be interpreted as entire segments of lowercase letters), not just individual lowercase characters. 

In cases where there are multiple contiguous lowercase characters, such as 'helloWORLD', the expected output would be 'WORLD', which the current implementation would not handle correctly if it interpreted lowercase substrings.

Thus, the program fails to fully satisfy the problem description requirements, as it does not clarify or explicitly handle the removal of entire lowercase substrings, but instead only filters out individual lowercase characters.
