Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task requires a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided implementation of `func_1` only retains uppercase characters from the string and discards everything else, including lowercase characters, spaces, and punctuation. 

For example, given the input `'PYTHon'`, the expected behavior according to the problem description would be to remove the lowercase substring `'on'`, but the implementation instead extracts only the uppercase letters, resulting in `'PYTH'`. Here, the function does not actually remove lowercase substrings but only filters out lowercase letters, which is not what was asked for.

A proper implementation would need to identify and remove entire substrings that are lowercase, potentially leaving other parts of the string intact. Therefore, the implementation deviates from the specified requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
