Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by filtering only the uppercase characters. The provided assert statements all test cases where lowercase letters are present, and the function returns the expected uppercase-only results. Therefore, it meets the problem description effectively. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause it to fail the requirement of removing lowercase substrings.
