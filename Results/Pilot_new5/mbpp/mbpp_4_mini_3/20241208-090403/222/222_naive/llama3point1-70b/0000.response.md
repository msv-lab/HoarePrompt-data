Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program only appends uppercase characters to the result string and ignores all other characters, including lowercase letters and non-alphabetic characters. 

For instance, if we input the string "Hello World", the expected output would be "HW", as it should remove all lowercase characters. However, when we input "Hello World", the function returns "HW", which is technically correct, but it doesn't account for the requirement to remove entire substrings that are lowercase. 

If the input is "abcABC", the expected output should be "ABC" since all lowercase characters need to be removed, but a case such as "abc" would be entirely omitted, not just their upper counterparts being included directly. 

Thus, the program does not fully meet the specified requirements given in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
