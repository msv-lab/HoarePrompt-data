Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string, retaining only the uppercase characters. It effectively filters the input string by checking each character with `char.isupper()`, and constructs a new string with only those characters. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases:

1. For the input `'PYTHon'`, the function returns `'PYTH'`, which is correct.
2. For the input `'FInD'`, the function returns `'FID'`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `'STRinG'`, the function returns `'STRG'`, which is correct as well.

Since I could not identify any potential case where the program does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
