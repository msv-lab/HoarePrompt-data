Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only constructs a new string consisting of uppercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the expected behavior (removing lowercase substrings) would involve removing the lowercase letters 'e', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r', and 'l', resulting in "H W". However, the given function only retains the uppercase letters, returning "HW".

Another example, for the input "aBcDeFg", the expected result should be "BCD", by removing all lowercase letters. However, the function would return "BCDF", which is incorrect.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove lowercase substrings, thereby failing to satisfy the problem description.
