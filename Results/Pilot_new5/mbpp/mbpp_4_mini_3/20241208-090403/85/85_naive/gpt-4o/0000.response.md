Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by using the minimum and maximum values from the array. The logic of computing `max_val - min_val` accurately reflects the requirement of determining the maximum difference. 

Here are the explanations for the provided test cases:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, thus the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which matches the assertion.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, thus the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`, which matches the assertion.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, thus the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`, which matches the assertion.

The program handles all potential edge cases correctly as it always calculates the difference based on the absolute minimum and maximum values of the array, which ensures that it finds the maximum possible difference regardless of the order of the elements.
