Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by using the formula `max(arr) - min(arr)`. This approach accounts for all potential cases:

1. If the array contains at least two elements, it accurately finds the maximum and minimum values and computes their difference.
2. If the array is empty, the behavior of `max()` and `min()` is to raise a `ValueError`, which is expected since we can't compute a difference without elements.
3. If the array contains only one element, both `max()` and `min()` return that element, resulting in a difference of `0`, which correctly reflects that there is no difference between identical elements.

Since the program handles the cases as described in the problem statement, it is deemed correct.
