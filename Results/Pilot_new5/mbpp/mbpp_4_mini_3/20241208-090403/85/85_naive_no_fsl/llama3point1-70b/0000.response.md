Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does so by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is indeed the correct approach for determining the maximum difference.

Here are some points confirming the correctness:

1. **Max and Min Functions**: The program uses the `max()` and `min()` functions which correctly identify the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
2. **Difference Calculation**: It subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value, thereby correctly calculating the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
   - An array with only one element, where the difference would be `0` (as max and min would be the same).
   - An empty array would raise a `ValueError`, which is an acceptable behavior since the problem does not specify a requirement for empty input handling.

No potential case was identified where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all valid inputs.
