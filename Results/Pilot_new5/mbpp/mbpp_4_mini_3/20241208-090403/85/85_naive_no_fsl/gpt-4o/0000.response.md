Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

1. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - It identifies the minimum and maximum values in the array using `min(arr)` and `max(arr)`.
   - It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`max_val - min_val`), which represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, thus `5 - 1 = 4`.
   - For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, so `9 - 1 = 8`.
   - For `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, leading to `3 - 1 = 2`.

All tested cases demonstrate that the function produces the correct maximum difference based on the problem description. 

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function will work correctly for arrays with any number of elements, including:
     - A single element array (e.g., `(1)`) where the max difference would be `0` since there's no other element to compare.
     - Arrays with repeated elements (e.g., `(2, 2, 2)`) which should also return `0`.

Given the thoroughness of the logic and the handling of edge cases, I conclude the implementation is correct.
