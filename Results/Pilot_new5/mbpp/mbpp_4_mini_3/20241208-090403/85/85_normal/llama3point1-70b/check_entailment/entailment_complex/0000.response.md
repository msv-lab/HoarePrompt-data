Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases. The problem description requires the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, if the array is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` when calling `max()` and `min()` functions on an empty list. This failure to handle the empty list case means that the function does not provide a valid output for all potential inputs, violating the problem's requirements.

In summary, while the function correctly calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a non-empty list, it does not account for the scenario where the input list is empty. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
