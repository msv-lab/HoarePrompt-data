The provided program is intended to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1(arr)` calculates this by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr`.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum difference by using `max(arr)` and `min(arr)`. However, an important edge case arises when the input array `arr` is empty. In such a scenario, calling `max()` and `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`, which is not addressed in the problem description.

Now, examining the output hints, they state that the function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values. They also mention that if `arr` is empty, it will raise a `ValueError`. This aligns with my earlier assessment of the code, confirming that the function does not handle the case of an empty list appropriately.

Given that the function does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case (specifically when `arr` is empty), the conclusion is that the function is indeed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the edge case of an empty array, which would result in a `ValueError`, thus not meeting the requirements of the problem description.
