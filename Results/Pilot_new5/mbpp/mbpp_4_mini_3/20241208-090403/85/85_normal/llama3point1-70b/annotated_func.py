#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr' of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that list. If `arr` is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to the `max()` and `min()` functions being called on an empty list.
