Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to the use of the `min()` and `max()` functions, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function expects a non-empty list of integers to operate correctly. **
