The variable `max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val - min_val`, which calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values from the list `arr`. The values of `min_val` and `max_val` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val`, and includes the newly computed `max_diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr`, `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`.**
