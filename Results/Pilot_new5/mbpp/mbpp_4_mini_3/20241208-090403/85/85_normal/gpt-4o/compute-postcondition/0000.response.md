`min_val` is assigned the value of the minimum element from the list `arr`. The state of `arr` is not changed by the operation, but `min_val` now holds the smallest integer from that list. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`.**
