The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it computes the maximum integer `max_val` and the minimum integer `min_val` from the list `arr`, and then returns the difference between these two values, which is `max_diff`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list.**
