#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum integer 'max_val' and the minimum integer 'min_val' from the list 'arr', which is 'max_diff'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to the use of the `min()` and `max()` functions, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function expects a non-empty list of integers to operate correctly.
