The program is intended to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, which aligns with the problem description. The core implementation consists of finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating their difference.

However, there are some critical points to consider:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to call `min()` and `max()`. The problem description does not specify that the input will always be a non-empty list. This means that the function is not robust and could fail for an empty input, which is against the expectation of being able to handle any valid input as usually expected in such problems.

2. **Correctness for Non-Empty Lists**: For non-empty lists, the function correctly computes the maximum difference by calculating the maximum and minimum values and returning their difference.

Given that the function does not handle the case of an empty list, it does not meet the requirement stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements completely.

Correctness: **False**
