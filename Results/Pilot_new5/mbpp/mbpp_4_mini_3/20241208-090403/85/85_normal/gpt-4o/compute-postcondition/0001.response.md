`max_val` is assigned the value of the maximum integer from the list `arr`. The state of the `arr` variable remains the same, and `min_val` is still the minimum integer from `arr`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, and `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr`.**
