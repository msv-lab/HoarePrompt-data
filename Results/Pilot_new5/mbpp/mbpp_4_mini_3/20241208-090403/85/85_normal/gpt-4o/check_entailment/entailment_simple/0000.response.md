Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(arr)` takes a sequence of integers (an array), which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: The program calculates the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values from the input array using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. This is necessary to determine the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

3. **Calculating Difference**: The program computes the maximum difference between the largest and smallest elements by subtracting `min_val` from `max_val`. This is the correct approach to find the maximum difference, as the problem statement requires.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns this difference, which fulfills the requirement of the problem description to provide the maximum difference.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test various cases, including arrays of different lengths and values, confirming that the function behaves as expected.

In summary, the function successfully identifies the maximum difference between any two elements in the provided array, adhering to the specifications given in the problem description.
