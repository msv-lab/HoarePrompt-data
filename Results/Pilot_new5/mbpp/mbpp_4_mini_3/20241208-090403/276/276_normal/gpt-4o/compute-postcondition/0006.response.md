Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then the median is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the median is equal to `merged_list[n]`.***
