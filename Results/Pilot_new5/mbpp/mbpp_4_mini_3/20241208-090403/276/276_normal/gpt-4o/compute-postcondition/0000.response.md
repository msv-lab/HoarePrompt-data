The value of `merged_list` is assigned the result of sorting the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order, the `merged_list` will also be a sorted list containing all the elements from both lists. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it represents the size of each list.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of each list, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
