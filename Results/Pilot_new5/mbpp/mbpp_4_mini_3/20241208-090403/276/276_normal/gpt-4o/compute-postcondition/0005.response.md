In the given code, `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[mid]`. The variable `mid` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer, and the length of `merged_list` is odd. This indicates that `mid` represents the index of the median value in the `merged_list`.

Since `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and the length of `merged_list` is odd, the median will be the middle element in that list. The value of `median` will be the element at the index `n`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as only `median` is affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is equal to `n`, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`, and the length of `merged_list` is odd.**
