Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The primary issue lies in the inaccurate handling of the indices when calculating the median based on the merged list. 

1. The program merges the two input lists `list1` and `list2` into `merged_list`, which correctly combines the two sorted lists into one sorted list.
2. It correctly identifies the midpoint of the merged list using `mid = len(merged_list) // 2`.
3. However, the calculation of the median in the comments is incorrect. The comments state that if the length of the `merged_list` is even, the median should be calculated as `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. This is misleading because `merged_list` has a length of `2n`, and the correct indices for the two middle elements when the merged list is of even length should be `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`.

Therefore, the median calculation is incorrect, as it refers to `n` which does not correctly point to the middle elements of the merged list. 

In conclusion, the function does not consistently return the correct median for all cases, especially when the merged list's length is even. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
