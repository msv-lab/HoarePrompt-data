The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `n` is a positive integer representing the size of each list (where `n = len(list1) = len(list2)`). The function returns the median of the merged list of `list1` and `list2`. If the length of the merged list is even, the median is calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2; if odd, the median is simply merged_list[n]. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of integers and their length, and return the median of their merged list based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers (list1, list2) and a positive integer (n), and returns the median of the merged list of the two input lists based on the evenness or oddness of the merged list's length.**
