The variable `median` is assigned the value of the average of the two middle elements of the `merged_list`. Given that the length of `merged_list` is even and `mid` is equal to `n`, `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` represent the two middle elements in the sorted list. Therefore, `median` is calculated as `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is equal to `n`, and `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.**
