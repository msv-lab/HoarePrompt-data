#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and n is a positive integer representing the size of each list (n = len(list1) = len(list2)).
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then the median is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the median is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. If even, median is (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2; if odd, median is merged_list[n].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`), merges the two lists into a single sorted list, and returns the median of this merged list. If the merged list's length is odd, it returns the middle element; if even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. Note that the returned median calculation references the merged list's length, which is `2n`, rather than `n`, making the annotation about using `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]` inaccurate.
