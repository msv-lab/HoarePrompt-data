The value of `mid` is assigned the integer division of the length of `merged_list` by 2. `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the size of each list, the length of `merged_list` will be `2 * n`. 

Thus, `mid` will be equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is equal to `n`.**
