Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two lists and sorts them, which is unnecessary since the input lists are already sorted. This can lead to inefficiency, especially for large lists.

2. **Median Calculation Error**: The program incorrectly calculates the median in the comments. It states that if the length of `merged_list` is even, then the median is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. However, this is not correct. The median for an even number of elements should be calculated as the average of the two middle elements of the merged list. For two lists of size `n`, the correct calculation should involve merging the lists and then using the middle indices (which are `n-1` and `n` when considering a zero-indexed array) of the merged list of size `2n`.

3. **Indexing Mistake**: The way the program calculates the index for median values is incorrect when n is used. It should be `mid - 1` and `mid` where `mid` is `len(merged_list) // 2`, not just using `n` directly.

For example, for the input lists `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, when merged, the combined sorted list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The median should be `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`, which the program returns correctly for this case, but the incorrect logic could fail for edge cases.

In summary, the program does not always correctly calculate the median based on the requirements set in the problem description due to incorrect median calculation logic, particularly in relation to the indices used.
