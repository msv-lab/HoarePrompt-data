Functionality: ** The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`), merges the two lists into a single sorted list, and returns the median of this merged list. If the merged list's length is odd, it returns the middle element; if even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. Note that the returned median calculation references the merged list's length, which is `2n`, rather than `n`, making the annotation about using `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]` inaccurate. **
