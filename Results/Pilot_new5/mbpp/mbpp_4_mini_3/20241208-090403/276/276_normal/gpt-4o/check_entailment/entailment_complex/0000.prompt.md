You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and n is a positive integer representing the size of each list (n = len(list1) = len(list2)).
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then the median is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the median is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. If even, median is (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2; if odd, median is merged_list[n].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`), merges the two lists into a single sorted list, and returns the median of this merged list. If the merged list's length is odd, it returns the middle element; if even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. Note that the returned median calculation references the merged list's length, which is `2n`, rather than `n`, making the annotation about using `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]` inaccurate.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
