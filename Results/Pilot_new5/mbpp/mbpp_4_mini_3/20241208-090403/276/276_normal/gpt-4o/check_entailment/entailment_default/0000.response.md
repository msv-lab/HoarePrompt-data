To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem description, the code itself, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

### Output Hints:
The function merges two sorted lists and returns the median of the merged list. It correctly returns the middle element if the length is odd, and the average of the two middle elements if the length is even. However, the note about using `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]` is pointed out as inaccurate.

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: 
   - The function correctly merges the two lists into a single sorted list. 
   - It calculates the median correctly when the total number of elements in the merged list (which will be `2n` since both lists have size `n`) is even.
   - When the length of the merged list is odd, it correctly identifies the middle element.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or contain negative numbers or duplicates. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the input lists are of the same size and contain integers, so these edge cases may not apply directly.
   - The program also does not consider the scenario where `n` may not represent the sizes of two sorted lists correctly if invalid inputs are passed.

3. **Output Hints Evaluation**:
   - The output hints do mention that the length of the merged list is `2n`, but the reference to `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]` is indeed inaccurate. However, the code itself correctly computes the median based on the merged list's full length.
   - The hints do not provide concrete examples that contradict the functionality of the code based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the intended functionality of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size correctly. However, without explicitly addressing edge cases or accounting for potential invalid inputs, we might consider its correctness to be limited but not incorrect based on the given task description.

Thus, I cannot find a specific input where the code fails to meet the requirements, and since the program correctly follows the problem description for valid inputs, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
