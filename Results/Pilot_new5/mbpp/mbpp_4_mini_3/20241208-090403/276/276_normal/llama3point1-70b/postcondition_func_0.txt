The function accepts two lists of integers and a positive integer representing their size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates and returns the median. If the size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements, but there is a critical flaw in the index access for the even case as it incorrectly accesses `merged_list[size]`, which is out of bounds since the valid indices range from `0` to `size - 1`. If the input lists are empty or their sizes are incorrectly specified, the function may raise an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs, which may lead to undesired behavior.
