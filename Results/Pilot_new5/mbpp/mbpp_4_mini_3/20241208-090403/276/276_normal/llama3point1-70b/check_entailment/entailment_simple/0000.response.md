To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem and the code.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function that finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

### Annotated Program
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:

1. It takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their size as input.
2. It merges these two lists and sorts the merged list.
3. It calculates the median based on the size of the merged list:
   - If the size is even, it averages the two middle values.
   - If the size is odd, it returns the middle value.

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Merging and Sorting**: The program merges `list1` and `list2` and sorts them, which is correct.
2. **Median Calculation**:
   - It computes `middle_index` as `size - 1`, but this logic is incorrect for median calculation.
   - For a list of size `size`, the correct indices for accessing the middle elements should be `(size // 2) - 1` and `(size // 2)` when the size is even.
   - The condition `if (size % 2 == 0)` only covers even-sized lists correctly, but it calculates the median incorrectly.

### Correctness Check
Given that the median calculation does not correctly account for the indices of a merged sorted list, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of correctly finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Correctness: **False**
