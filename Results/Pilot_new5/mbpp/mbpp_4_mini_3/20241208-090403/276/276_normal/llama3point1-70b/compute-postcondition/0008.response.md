The function `func_1` accepts parameters `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and `size` is a positive integer that is equal to the lengths of `list1` and `list2`. After executing the function, it returns the median value based on the size of the merged list formed from `list1` and `list2`. If the size is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the merged list; if the size is odd, the median is the middle element of the merged list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers and their size, and return the median value of the merged list formed from these two lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers and their size, and returns the median value of the merged list formed from these two lists. If the merged list size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if odd, it returns the middle element.**
