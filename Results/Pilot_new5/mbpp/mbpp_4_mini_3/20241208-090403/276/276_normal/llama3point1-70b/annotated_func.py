#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, and size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) == len(list2).
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `size` is a positive integer, and `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value based on the size of the merged list formed from `list1` and `list2`, where if the size is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`, and if the size is odd, the median is `merged_list[middle_index]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers and a positive integer representing their size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates and returns the median. If the size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements, but there is a critical flaw in the index access for the even case as it incorrectly accesses `merged_list[size]`, which is out of bounds since the valid indices range from `0` to `size - 1`. If the input lists are empty or their sizes are incorrectly specified, the function may raise an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs, which may lead to undesired behavior.
