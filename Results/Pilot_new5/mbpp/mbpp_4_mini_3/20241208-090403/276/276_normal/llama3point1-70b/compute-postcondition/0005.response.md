In this case, `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. Given that `size` is a positive odd integer, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`. Therefore, `middle_index` will always point to the middle element of the sorted `merged_list`, which is derived from combining `list1` and `list2`. The output state will reflect the assignment to `median` based on the provided values of `list1`, `list2`, and `size`.

Since the values of `list1`, `list2`, and the merged list itself are not specified, we can only indicate that `median` is taking the value from the merged list at the middle index.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[middle_index]`**.
