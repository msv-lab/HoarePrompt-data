The value of `middle_index` is assigned as `size - 1`. The variable `size` is known to be a positive integer and is equal to the length of both `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, `middle_index` will be a non-negative integer, specifically one less than the `size`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
