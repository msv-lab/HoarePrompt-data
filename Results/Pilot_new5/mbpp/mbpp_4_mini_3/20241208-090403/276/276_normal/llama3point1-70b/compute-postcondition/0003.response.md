The code calculates the value of `median` based on the `merged_list`, which is not directly mentioned in the initial state but is implied as a combination of `list1` and `list2`. Given that `size` is even, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. The code takes the average of the two middle elements in the sorted `merged_list`.

1. `middle_index` is defined as `size - 1`, which means it points to the last index of the first half of the merged list.
2. The `median` is calculated as the average of the elements at `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`.

Since `size` is even and `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `middle_index + 1` will be `size`. The value of `median` thus depends on the two middle elements of the merged list.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2**.
