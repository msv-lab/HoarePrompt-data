The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The initial state indicates that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers and that `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists. Therefore, `merged_list` will be a sorted list containing all the elements from both `list1` and `list2`. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer such that `size == len(list1) == len(list2)`; `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
