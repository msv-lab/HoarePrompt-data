You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, and size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) == len(list2).
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `size` is a positive integer, and `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value based on the size of the merged list formed from `list1` and `list2`, where if the size is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`, and if the size is odd, the median is `merged_list[middle_index]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers and a positive integer representing their size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates and returns the median. If the size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements, but there is a critical flaw in the index access for the even case as it incorrectly accesses `merged_list[size]`, which is out of bounds since the valid indices range from `0` to `size - 1`. If the input lists are empty or their sizes are incorrectly specified, the function may raise an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs, which may lead to undesired behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
