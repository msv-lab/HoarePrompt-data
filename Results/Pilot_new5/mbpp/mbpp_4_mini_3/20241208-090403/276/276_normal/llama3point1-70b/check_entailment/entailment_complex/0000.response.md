Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, there is a critical flaw in the way it calculates the median when the size is even. 

In the case where `size` is even, the program attempts to access `merged_list[size]`, which is out of bounds since the valid indices for `merged_list` (which has a length of `2 * size`) range from `0` to `2 * size - 1`. The correct indices to access for calculating the median would be `size - 1` and `size` (the two middle elements of the merged list).

Therefore, in scenarios where the size of the input lists is even, the program will raise an `IndexError`. This indicates that the function does not correctly calculate the median as required by the problem description, making it incorrect. Additionally, the function does not validate its inputs, which could lead to undesired behavior. 

Overall, the function fails to correctly handle the median calculation for even-sized lists and could raise an error, which directly violates the requirement of the problem description.
