To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem description states to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

### Analysis

1. **Merging the Lists**: 
   - The program merges the two lists and sorts them. Given that both input lists are sorted, this step is unnecessary because we could directly use the properties of the sorted lists to find the median without merging.

2. **Finding the Median**:
   - The program calculates the median based on the total number of elements in the merged list. It correctly identifies whether the total number of elements is odd or even and calculates the median accordingly.

### Potential Issue

Although the program is logically correct for a large set of test cases, it does not take into account that the two lists are already sorted. This could lead to inefficiency. However, the problem statement does not specify performance constraints, so we focus on correctness.

### Edge Case Consideration
A potential edge case can occur if:
- All elements in `list1` and `list2` are identical, e.g., `list1 = [1, 1, 1]` and `list2 = [1, 1, 1]`. The median should indeed be `1`, and since the algorithm combines both lists, it will correctly return the median.

- Lists with negative elements or zero, e.g., `list1 = [-3, -1, 0]` and `list2 = [-2, 1, 5]`. The merged list will be `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 5]`, which correctly results in a median of `(-1 + 0) / 2 = -0.5`.

- Lists that contain mixed numbers: e.g., `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` should yield a median of `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

After evaluating these cases, the algorithm correctly finds the median for various scenarios.

### Conclusion

No potential cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Therefore, the code correctly meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
