Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logical error in calculating the median. In the case where the size is even, it incorrectly uses `middle_index` to find the two middle elements. The `middle_index` should be `size // 2` for the first middle element and `size // 2 - 1` for the second middle element. 

For example, consider the following case where `list1 = [1, 3]`, `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`. The merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the program will incorrectly use elements at index 1 and 2, leading to `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.

Thus, the program does not handle the even-sized case correctly, leading to incorrect results.
