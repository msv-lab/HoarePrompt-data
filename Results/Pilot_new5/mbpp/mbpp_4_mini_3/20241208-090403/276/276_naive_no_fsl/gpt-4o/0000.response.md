To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description, which states that it should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The function works as follows:
1. It takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) and their size (`n`).
2. It merges both lists into one sorted list.
3. It calculates the median based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- The function assumes that both lists are sorted. If they are not sorted and provided unsorted lists, the result would be incorrect.
- It does not handle the case of empty lists. If it receives two empty lists, it would lead to an error when trying to access elements of the merged list.
- The function doesnâ€™t check if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal to `n`. If they are not, it may lead to an incorrect result.
  
Now let's consider a test case that can expose a flaw in the implementation:
1. If both lists are empty: `func_1([], [], 0)` would lead to an empty merged list, and trying to calculate the median would result in accessing an index that doesn't exist.

With this in mind, since the program does not correctly handle the case of empty lists and doesn't validate the sorted input or the size of the lists, we can conclude the following:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails for the case of empty lists.
