Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**:
   - The program uses `middle_index = size - 1`, which is incorrect for finding the middle index of a merged list.
   - When `size` is even, the median should be calculated using the two middle elements, which are located at `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. 
   - When `size` is odd, the middle index should be `size // 2`, not `size - 1`.

2. **Assumption of Sorted Input**:
   - Although the problem states that the input lists are sorted, the merged list is sorted again using `sorted(list1 + list2)`, which is unnecessary, but it also impacts performance without affecting correctness since the two lists are assumed to be sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the input lists are empty. If `list1` and `list2` are both empty, it will throw an index error.

For example, if we test the function with `func_1([1, 3], [2, 4], 2)`, the expected output should be `2.5`, but the code will not correctly calculate this median due to the index errors mentioned above. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle the calculation of the median correctly in all potential cases.
