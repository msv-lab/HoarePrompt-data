Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. According to the problem description, we need to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. However, the function only returns the first occurrence of the substring.

For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1('python python programming', 'python')
```

The expected behavior would be to return the first occurrence of 'python' (which is at positions 0 to 6) and potentially indicate that it can occur again. However, the program does not provide any indication of subsequent occurrences or handle them appropriately. Because it does not meet the requirements for all potential cases of the substring's occurrences, the correctness is deemed false.
