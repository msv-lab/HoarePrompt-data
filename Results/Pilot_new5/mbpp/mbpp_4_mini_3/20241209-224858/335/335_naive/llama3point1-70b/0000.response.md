Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. According to the problem description, it should find all occurrences and their respective positions, but the current implementation only finds the first occurrence. 

For example, if we test the function with the input `func_1("hello hello", "hello")`, the expected output would include both occurrences of "hello" with their positions, but the function only returns the first occurrence:

```python
func_1("hello hello", "hello")
```

Expected output: `("hello", 0, 4)` and a second call for the second occurrence would be needed, which the function does not support. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
