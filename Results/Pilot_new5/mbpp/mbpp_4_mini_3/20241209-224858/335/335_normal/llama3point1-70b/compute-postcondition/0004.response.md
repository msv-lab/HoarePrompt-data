The variable `end` is assigned the value of `start + len(substring)`. Since `substring` is a valid substring of `string`, its length is a positive integer. The value of `start` is a valid index (not equal to -1). Therefore, the value of `end` becomes equal to the index of `substring` in `string` plus the length of `substring`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is a valid substring of `string`, `start` is an integer representing the index of `substring` in `string`, `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`**
