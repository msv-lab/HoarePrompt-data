To assess the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. If there is no match, the function should return `None`.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, it returns `None`.
- If `substring` is found, it calculates its ending index by adding the length of `substring` to the starting index.
- The function then returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. If `substring` is at the beginning or the end of `string`, the function needs to return the appropriate indices.
2. If `substring` appears multiple times in `string`, this implementation only returns the first occurrence. The problem does not mention how to handle multiple occurrences.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function accepts two non-empty strings and correctly returns `None` if `substring` is not found. If `substring` is found, it states that the function returns the substring, its starting index, and its ending index minus one.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
- The code does align with the output hints regarding returning `None` when the substring is not found.
- However, the hints also suggest that the function assumes `substring` is valid, which could imply that it expects multiple occurrences or different conditions, but the code does not handle those cases.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It does not account for multiple occurrences of `substring`, which is a critical aspect that should be handled according to the problem description expectations. For example, if `string` is "abcabc" and `substring` is "abc", the function only returns the first occurrence instead of providing information about all occurrences.

Correctness: **False**.
