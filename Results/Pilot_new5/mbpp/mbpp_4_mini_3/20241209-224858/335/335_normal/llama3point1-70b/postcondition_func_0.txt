The function accepts two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`, and returns None if `substring` is not found in `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one in `string`. The function assumes that `substring` is a valid substring of `string`, as indicated by the initial comment, but it does not handle cases where `substring` is actually not present in `string`, which would lead to an incorrect assumption based on the annotations.
