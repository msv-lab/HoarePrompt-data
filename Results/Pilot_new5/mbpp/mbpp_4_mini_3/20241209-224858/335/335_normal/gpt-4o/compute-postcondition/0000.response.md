The variable `start_pos` is assigned the value returned by calling the `find` method on `main_string` with `sub_string` as the argument. The `find` method returns the lowest index in `main_string` where the substring `sub_string` is found. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is the index of `sub_string` in `main_string` or -1 if not found.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is the index of `sub_string` in `main_string` or -1 if not found.**
