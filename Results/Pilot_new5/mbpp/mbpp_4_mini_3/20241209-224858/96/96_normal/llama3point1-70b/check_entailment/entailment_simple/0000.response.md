Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(tup)` is defined to take a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple containing elements of any data type.

2. **Set Comprehension**: Inside the function, a set comprehension is used: `set(type(x) for x in tup)`. This creates a set of the types of each element in the tuple. Since a set can only contain unique values, if all elements of the tuple are of the same type, the resulting set will contain only one unique type.

3. **Length Comparison**: The function checks if the length of this set is equal to 1: `len(set(...)) == 1`. If the length is 1, it means all elements are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. If the length is greater than 1, it indicates that there are elements of different types, and the function returns `False`.

4. **Return Values**: The return values align with the problem description, where `True` is returned if all elements have the same data type, and `False` is returned otherwise.

The program handles all edge cases as well:
- For an empty tuple, it will return `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition of having the same type.
- For a tuple with a single element, it will also return `True`.

In summary, the program accurately implements the requirement stated in the problem description, thus validating its correctness.
