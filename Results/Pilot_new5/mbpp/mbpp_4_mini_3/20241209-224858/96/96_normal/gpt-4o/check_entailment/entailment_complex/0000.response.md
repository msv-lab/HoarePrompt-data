Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Empty Tuple Case**: The function immediately returns `True` if the tuple is empty. This is appropriate because the problem description does not specify a behavior for empty tuples, and returning `True` can be justified under the notion that there are no elements to contradict uniformity in type.

2. **Type Checking**: The function retrieves the type of the first element in the tuple and compares it with the types of all other elements using a `for` loop. If any element's type does not match the type of the first element, it returns `False`. This behavior correctly captures the requirement of checking for uniformity in data types.

3. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatched types, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program also illustrate the expected behavior:
- The first assertion checks a tuple of integers, which should return `True`.
- The second assertion checks a tuple with mixed types (integers and a string), which should return `False`.
- The third assertion checks another tuple of integers, which also returns `True`.

Each of these scenarios confirms that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct, and the conclusion is that it meets all the requirements specified.
