`first_type` is assigned the type of the first element in the tuple `tup`. Since `tup` is not empty, `first_type` will hold the type of `tup[0]`, which can be any data type depending on the content of the tuple. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any data type, and `tup` is not empty; `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`.**
