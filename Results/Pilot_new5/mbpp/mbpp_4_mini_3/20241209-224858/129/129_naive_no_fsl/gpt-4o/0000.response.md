Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions given in the program validate the function against specific test cases, all of which are correct. 

The `ord()` function will handle all valid single character inputs (including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters) properly and return their respective ASCII values. Since the program does not specify any constraints on the input, it is assumed that it will only receive single characters. 

There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws present in this implementation based on the problem description, making the program correct for all valid single character inputs.
