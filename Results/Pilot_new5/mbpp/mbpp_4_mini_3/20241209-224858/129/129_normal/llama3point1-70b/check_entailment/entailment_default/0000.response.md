The provided code correctly implements the function to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function. The problem description specifies that the function should return the ASCII value of a single character, and the code does this accurately.

However, upon reviewing the output hints, it indicates that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string. This suggests that if the input is an empty string, a string with more than one character, or even a non-string type, the function may not behave correctly, potentially raising a TypeError.

To further analyze:
1. If `char` is an empty string (`""`), the `ord()` function would raise a `TypeError` because there is no character to convert.
2. If `char` is a string of length greater than 1 (e.g., `"ab"`), it would also raise a `TypeError`.
3. If `char` is not a string type (e.g., an integer or a list), it would lead to a `TypeError` as well.

Thus, the function does not meet the problem description for all cases because it does not handle these edge cases. It should have checks to ensure that the input is a single character string before attempting to retrieve its ASCII value.

Correctness: **False**.
