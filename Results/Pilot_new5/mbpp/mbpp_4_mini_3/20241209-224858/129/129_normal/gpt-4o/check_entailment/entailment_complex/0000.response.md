Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements in all cases. The function `func_1` is designed to return the ASCII (Unicode) value of a single character string. However, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character (e.g., an empty string or a string containing multiple characters). 

For example:
- If the input is an empty string `''`, calling `func_1('')` would raise a `TypeError` because `ord()` expects a string of length 1.
- If the input is a string with multiple characters like `'AB'`, calling `func_1('AB')` would also raise a `TypeError` for the same reason.

Thus, the function is not robust and can fail to meet the requirements of the problem description in these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
