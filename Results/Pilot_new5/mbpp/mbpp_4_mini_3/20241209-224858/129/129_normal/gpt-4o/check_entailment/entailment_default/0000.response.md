The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses the built-in `ord` function to return the ASCII (Unicode code point) value of a single character. However, the problem description requires the function to find the ASCII value of a character, and there is no specification about the behavior when the input is not a single character.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code correctly implements finding the ASCII value for given single-character inputs ('A', 'R', 'S') and returns the expected values.
2. However, it does not handle cases where the input is either an empty string, multiple characters, or non-character inputs. For example, passing an empty string `""` or a multi-character string like `"AB"` will lead to unexpected results:
   - `func_1("")` will result in an error as `ord` cannot take an empty input.
   - `func_1("AB")` will raise an error as `ord` expects a single character.

### Output Hints:
The output hints clarify that the function:
- Accepts a single character string and returns its Unicode code point as an integer.
- Does not handle cases where the input is not a single character (e.g., empty string or multiple characters), which may lead to unexpected results or errors.

The output hints agree with the initial assessment that the function does not manage edge cases properly, particularly with regards to input validation.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, specifically failing for empty strings and multi-character strings, **the function does not meet the correctness criteria**.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not account for the case where the input is not a single character, such as an empty string or a string of multiple characters, which leads to unexpected results or errors.
