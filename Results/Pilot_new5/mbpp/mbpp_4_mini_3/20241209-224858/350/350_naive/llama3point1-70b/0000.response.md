Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the last index to the first index, checking if the current element matches the target. If it finds a match, it returns the index. If no match is found, it returns -1. 

The algorithm handles all potential cases:
- If the array contains the target element, it correctly returns the last occurrence.
- If the target is not in the array, it returns -1 as expected.
- It correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty array, returning -1.

Therefore, I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
