The provided program aims to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The description states that the function should return the index of the last occurrence of `x` or -1 if `x` is not found. 

### Initial Assessment of the Code:
The function `func_1` iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element equals `x`. If it finds a match, it returns the index. If it completes the loop without finding `x`, it returns -1. This approach correctly seeks the last occurrence of `x`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty List**: The function should return -1 if the list is empty, which matches the description.
2. **Element Not Present**: If `x` is not in `arr`, the function correctly returns -1, as per the description.
3. **Multiple Occurrences**: The function correctly identifies the last occurrence of `x` if it appears multiple times, which is also in line with the requirements.

### Output Hints:
The output hints affirm that the function accepts a sorted list and an integer, returning the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or -1 if `x` isn't found. It mentions that the function handles cases where `x` appears multiple times, once, or not at all correctly.

### Agreement Between Code and Output Hints:
The output hints align well with the logic of the code. All specified cases are covered: returning the last index of `x` if present, returning -1 if not present, and handling an empty list appropriately. 

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code against the problem description and considering the output hints, I see no discrepancies or edge cases that the code fails to handle. The function behaves as intended for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the functionality of finding the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array, adhering to the problem description and handling all edge cases effectively.
