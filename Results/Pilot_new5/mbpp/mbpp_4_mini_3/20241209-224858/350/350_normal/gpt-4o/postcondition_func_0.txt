The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is not found. The function correctly handles cases where `x` appears multiple times, once, or not at all in the list. If `arr` is empty, it will also return -1, as there would be no elements to find `x` in.
