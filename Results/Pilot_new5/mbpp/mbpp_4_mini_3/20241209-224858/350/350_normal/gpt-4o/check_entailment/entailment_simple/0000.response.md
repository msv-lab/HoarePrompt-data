The provided program is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Let's analyze the function `func_1` and see if it adheres to the problem description.

1. **Function Logic**: The function iterates over the array `arr` in reverse order. It checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to `x`. If a match is found, it returns the index `i`, which represents the last occurrence of `x` in the sorted array. If the loop completes without finding `x`, it returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in the array.

2. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is present in the array, returning the last index of its occurrence.
   - It also properly returns `-1` when `x` is not found in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function seems to handle edge cases, such as:
   - If `arr` is empty, the function will immediately return `-1`.
   - If `x` appears multiple times, it correctly returns the last occurrence.

4. **Behavior on Sorted Arrays**: Since the function iterates from the end to the beginning of the array, it guarantees that it will find the last occurrence of `x` in a sorted array.

Given these points, the function accurately implements the requirements declared in the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
