According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. Since the loop continues executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `len(arr) - 3`.

Moreover, the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `arr` contains at least 1 integer, `len(arr)` is at least 1. Thus, `len(arr) - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which implies that `len(arr)` must be at least 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order containing at least 3 integers, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, i is equal to `len(arr) - 3`.**
