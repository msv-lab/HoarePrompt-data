Output State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers, `target` is an integer, and if `target` is not found in `arr`, the loop will have executed `len(arr)` times. If `target` is found, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` (if duplicates exist), otherwise, the output index will be None, and `i` will be -1 after all iterations.**
