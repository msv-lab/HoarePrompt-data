According to the code, the loop iterates backward through the list `arr`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, which is the second-to-last index of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` must still contain at least one element in order for the index `i` to be valid.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers containing at least one element, i is `len(arr) - 1`**
