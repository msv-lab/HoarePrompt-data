The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `target`, which is an integer. 

- In Case_1, if the `target` value is found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns the index `i`, which is the position of the `target` value in the list.
  
- In Case_2, if the `target` is not found but the list `arr` contains at least one element, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`.

- In Case_3, if the list `arr` contains at least one element and the `target` is still not found, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to the length of the list `arr` minus 1, indicating the index of the last element in the sorted list of integers.

- In Case_4, if the `target` value is not found in the list `arr` after executing the loop `len(arr)` times, the function returns -1, indicating that the target is not found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the index of the `target` in the list, or specific indices based on the presence or absence of `target` in `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returns the index of `target` if found, otherwise returns specific indices based on the state of the search and returns -1 if `target` is not found.**
