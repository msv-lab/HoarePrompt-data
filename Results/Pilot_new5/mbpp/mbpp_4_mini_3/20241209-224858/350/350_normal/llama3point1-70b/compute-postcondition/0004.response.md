According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `arr`. Since `arr` must have at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1, making `i` at least 0.

In the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be at least 0, which means that after decrementing, `i` will be -1, and the loop will not execute further.

To summarize, after the previous iteration where `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be set to `len(arr) - 2`, and `arr` must still have at least 1 element (which it does).

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `target` is an integer**.
