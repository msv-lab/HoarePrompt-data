The given Python program is designed to find the last position of an element (target) in a sorted array (arr). Let's analyze the annotated program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Traversal of the Array**: The program uses a for loop that starts from the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`) and decrements down to `0`. This ensures that if the target exists multiple times in the array, the loop will find the last occurrence first.

2. **Comparison**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is equal to the target. If it finds an equal element, it immediately returns the index `i`.

3. **Return Value If Not Found**: If the target is not found in the array after the loop completes, the program returns `-1`. This indicates that the target does not exist in the array.

4. **Sorted Array Assumption**: The program correctly assumes that the input array is sorted, and thus this approach of starting from the end will yield the correct last position of the target.

Considering these points, the program effectively implements the requirement to find the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array. It handles both the presence and absence of the target correctly and efficiently.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

Correctness: **True**
