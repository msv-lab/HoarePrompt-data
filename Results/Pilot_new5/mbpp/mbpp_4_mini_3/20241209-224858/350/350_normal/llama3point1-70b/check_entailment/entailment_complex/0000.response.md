The provided program is intended to find the last position of an element (denoted as `target`) in a sorted array (denoted as `arr`). 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program iterates through the array `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving to the first.
2. For each element in the array, it checks if that element is equal to `target`.
3. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of that match, ensuring that the last occurrence of `target` is returned if duplicates exist.
4. If no match is found by the end of the loop, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `target` is not present in the array.

### Correspondence to the Problem Description:
- The program accurately finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, as required by the problem description. It effectively handles arrays that contain duplicates by returning the index of the last occurrence of `target`.
- The edge case where `target` is not present in the array is also correctly handled by returning `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
