Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Let's analyze the behavior of the function:

1. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index.
2. It checks if the current element is equal to `x`.
3. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that match, which is indeed the last position of `x` in the sorted array.
4. If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns -1, indicating that `x` is not in the array.

The given assertions validate the function against various cases, and all assertions hold true. 

- For the first assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)`, the last position of `1` is indeed `0`.
- For the second assertion, `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, the last position of `1` is `2`.
- For the third assertion, `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)`, the last position of `3` is `3`.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty array returns `-1`, which is correct since there are no elements to find.
- If `x` is not present in the array, it correctly returns `-1`.

Since there are no potential cases that demonstrate the function does not work as expected, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Thus, the final statement is:
Correctness: **True**
