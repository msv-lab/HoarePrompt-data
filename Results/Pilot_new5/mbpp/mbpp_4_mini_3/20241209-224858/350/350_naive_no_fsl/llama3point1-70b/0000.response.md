Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why the code is considered correct:

1. **Iteration in Reverse**: The function iterates over the array from the last index to the first index. This allows it to find the last occurrence of the target element efficiently.

2. **Comparison**: It checks if the current element is equal to the target. If it finds a match, it returns the index immediately, which is the last position found due to the reverse iteration.

3. **Return Value for Absence**: If it goes through the entire array without finding the target, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles the case when the array is empty (it will return `-1`), and it also correctly finds the last occurrence in arrays with duplicates.

As I cannot identify a case where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
