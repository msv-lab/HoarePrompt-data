Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as inputs and returns the count of occurrences of that element within the tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuples.

The assertions provided in the program test the function with various inputs:

1. The first assertion checks that the count of `4` in the tuple returns `0`, which is correct because `4` does not exist in the tuple.
2. The second assertion checks that the count of `10` returns `3`, which is correct since `10` appears three times in the tuple.
3. The third assertion checks that the count of `8` returns `4`, which is also correct as `8` appears four times in the tuple.

The function handles all tested cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or missing logic identified in the implementation. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential inputs based on the problem description.
