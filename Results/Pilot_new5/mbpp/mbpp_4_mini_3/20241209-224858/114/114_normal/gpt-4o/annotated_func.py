#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of how many times 'element' appears in the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element` of any data type, and returns the count of how many times `element` appears in `tup`. It handles all data types that can be contained in a tuple and will return 0 if the `element` is not found in the tuple.
