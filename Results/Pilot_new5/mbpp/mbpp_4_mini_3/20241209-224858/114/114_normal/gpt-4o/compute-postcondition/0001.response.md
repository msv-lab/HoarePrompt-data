The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type, and `element` can also be of any data type. The function returns the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and return the number of occurrences of `element` within `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup (a tuple of any data type) and a parameter element (of any data type), and returns the count of how many times element appears in tup.**
