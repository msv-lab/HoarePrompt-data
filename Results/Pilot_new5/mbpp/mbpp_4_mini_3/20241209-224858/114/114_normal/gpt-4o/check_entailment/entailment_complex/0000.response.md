Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `element` in `tup` using the `count` method of tuples.

Here is why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple, which is explicitly stated in the problem description. It also accepts an `element` that can be of any data type, which aligns with the requirements.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `tup.count(element)` directly counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`. This meets the requirement of counting occurrences as specified in the problem description.

3. **Return Value**: If the `element` is not found in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` will return `0`, which is also in accordance with the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test the function against different scenarios, including cases where the element is not present (returns `0`), and cases where the element is present multiple times (returns the correct count). The function passes all these tests, confirming its correctness.

Overall, the function behaves as specified in the problem description for all potential inputs, making the program correct.
