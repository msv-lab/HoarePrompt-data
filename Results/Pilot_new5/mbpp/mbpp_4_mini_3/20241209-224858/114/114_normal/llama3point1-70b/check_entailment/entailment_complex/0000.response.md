Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It uses the method `count` on the tuple to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. 

The following points confirm that the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a tuple for the first parameter and an element of any data type for the second parameter, as specified in the problem description.
  
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `tup.count(elem)` correctly counts how many times `elem` appears in `tup`, which is the primary requirement of the problem.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count as an integer, including the correct behavior of returning `0` in cases where `elem` is not present in the tuple.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles all potential cases, such as when `elem` is of a different type than the elements in `tup`, or when `tup` is empty.

Since the program correctly implements the described functionality for all defined cases, it adheres to the specifications laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
