Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(length, width)` that correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The test cases provided in the assertions verify that the function behaves as expected for positive integer inputs.

- For `func_1(10, 20)`, it correctly returns `200` (10 * 20).
- For `func_1(10, 5)`, it correctly returns `50` (10 * 5).
- For `func_1(4, 2)`, it correctly returns `8` (4 * 2).

Since the function is expected to compute the area of a rectangle for any non-negative lengths and widths, and it works correctly for the tested cases, I can conclude that the program is correct based on the provided problem description. There are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned that the function fails to handle, and it works as intended for the given inputs.
