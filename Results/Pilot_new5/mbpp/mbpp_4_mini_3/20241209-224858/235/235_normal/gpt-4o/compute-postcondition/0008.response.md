The value of `total` is incremented by the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `n % 10` will yield values ranging from 0 to 9 depending on the specific value of `n`. The state of `total` is modified, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `total` is increased by `n % 10`.**
