Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to take a non-negative integer as its input, as asserted in the comments. The condition `while n > 0` ensures that the loop runs only when `n` is positive.

2. **Digit Extraction**: Inside the loop, `n % 10` is used to get the last digit of `n`. This digit is then added to the `total`, which accumulates the sum of the digits.

3. **Reduction of n**: The operation `n //= 10` correctly removes the last digit from `n`, allowing the function to process each digit in turn until `n` is reduced to zero.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `total`, which precisely represents the sum of all digits in the original value of `n`. The comment indicates that if `n` is initially 0, the function correctly returns 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

5. **Assertion Tests**: The assertions provided verify that the function works correctly for several test cases, confirming it produces the expected output for non-negative integers.

The function effectively handles all cases as required by the problem description, including the edge case of `n = 0`. Thus, the program meets the requirements, and the answer is True.
