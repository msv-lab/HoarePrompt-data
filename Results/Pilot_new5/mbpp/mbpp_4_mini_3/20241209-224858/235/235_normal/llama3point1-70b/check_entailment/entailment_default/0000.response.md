The program description states that the function should get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided program does this by converting the integer into a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.

Looking at the code, it seems to handle non-negative integers as expected. Specifically:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, which is correct.
- If `n` is any non-negative integer, it will correctly sum the digits.

Now, considering edge cases:
- The program assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer. If a negative integer or a non-integer (like a string or float) is passed, the function will raise an error. This means the function does not strictly adhere to the problem description if we consider that "non-negative integer" means it should only accept non-negative integers without raising errors for other types.

Now, analyzing the output hints:
- The hints indicate that the function accepts a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits, which aligns with the code.
- The hints also mention that it does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, reaffirming the earlier point that it does not meet the problem's guidelines if incorrect inputs are provided.

Given this analysis, while the code works for valid inputs (non-negative integers), it fails to handle edge cases (invalid input types). Thus, it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
