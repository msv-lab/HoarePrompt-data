Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`), adds it to the total, and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`) until there are no digits left (i.e., `n` becomes 0). 

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works for the test cases `345`, `12`, and `97`, producing the expected results of `12`, `3`, and `16`, respectively. 

Since the problem description states that the function should handle non-negative integers, edge cases such as `0` (which should return `0`) and any other large non-negative integers are also well managed by the logic of the function. There are no missing logic or edge cases in the implementation. Thus, the program meets all the requirements set out in the problem description.
