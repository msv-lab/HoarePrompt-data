To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze it carefully.

**Problem Description**: The function should check whether the frequency of each digit in an integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis**:

1. The program converts the integer `n` into a string format, which allows iteration over each character (digit).
2. It then counts the occurrences of each digit in the string representation of `n`.
3. For each digit, it checks if the count exceeds the integer value of that digit. If it does, the function returns `False`.
4. If all digits are within the specified frequency limit, it returns `True`.

**Potential Case**:
- Consider the integer `n = 112`. The digits are `1` and `2`.
    - The digit `1` appears `2` times, which is equal to the integer value of `1`, so it passes this check.
    - The digit `2` appears `1` time, which is less than or equal to the integer value of `2`, so it also passes this check.
    - The function returns `True`, which is correct since the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

- Now consider `n = 222`. The digit `2` appears `3` times, which is greater than the integer value of `2`. The function should return `False`, which it does.

**Issues with the Program**:
- The issue arises when considering the case where `n` is `0`. For `n = 0`, the only digit is `0`, which appears `1` time. Since `1 > 0`, the function would return `False`. However, it could be argued whether this is consistent with the problem description:
  - Frequency of `0` is `1`, which is not less than or equal to `0`.

Thus, the function does not properly handle the case when `n` is `0` because the frequency of `0` exceeds the digit itself.

**Conclusion**:
Since there exists at least one case (i.e., when `n = 0`) where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, we determine that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
