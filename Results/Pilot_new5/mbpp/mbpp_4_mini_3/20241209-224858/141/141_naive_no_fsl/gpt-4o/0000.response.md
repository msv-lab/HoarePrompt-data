To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its functionality against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Test Cases Given:
1. `func_1(1234)` should return `True`.
2. `func_1(51241)` should return `False`.
3. `func_1(321)` should return `True`.

### Analysis of Function:
- **Frequency Calculation**: The function correctly constructs a frequency dictionary for the digits in the number.
- **Comparison Logic**: It checks if the frequency of each digit is greater than the digit itself. If it is, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Zero Case**: If the input is `0`, the frequency of `0` should be `1`, which does not satisfy the condition since `count (1) > int(digit) (0)`. This should return `False`, but the current implementation will return `True` since the number `0` does not appear in the frequency check.
2. **Single Digit Number**: For any single-digit number (e.g., `9`), it should return `True` since the frequency of `9` is `1`, which is less than or equal to `9`.
3. **Leading Zeros**: If we consider a case like `100`, the function would count `1` (frequency `1`), `0` (frequency `2`), and according to the logic, it checks `0` against its frequency. Thus, it should return `False` since `2 > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where the digit `0` has a frequency greater than its value, which contradicts the problem description. Therefore, since there are inputs for which the function does not work as expected, we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation of Failure Case:
For the input `0`, the function would incorrectly return `True`, while it should return `False` because the condition of the frequency of the digit being less than or equal to itself is not satisfied.
