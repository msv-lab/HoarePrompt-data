Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to check whether the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **String Conversion**: It converts the integer `n` into its string representation `str_n`, which allows for easy iteration through each digit.

3. **Frequency Counting**: For each digit in `str_n`, the program uses `str_n.count(digit)` to count how many times that particular digit appears in the string. This count is then compared to the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).

4. **Condition Check**: The program iterates through each digit and checks if the count exceeds the digit's integer value. If any digit's count is greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`.

5. **Final Return**: If all digits meet the condition (their counts are less than or equal to their integer values), the function returns `True`.

The algorithm efficiently checks each digit's frequency against its value and handles all non-negative integers as required by the problem description. Therefore, it correctly fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description, making the overall correctness assessment True.
