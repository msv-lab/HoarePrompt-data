Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` has iterated through each character of `str_n`, and the count of each `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If any `digit` had a count greater than its integer value, the function would have returned False.**
