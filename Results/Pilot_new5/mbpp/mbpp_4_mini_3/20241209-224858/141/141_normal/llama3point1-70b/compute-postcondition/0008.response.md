According to the code, the for loop iterates over each character in the string `str_n`. The loop will continue as long as there are characters in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is currently the second character of `str_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` must be updated to the next character in `str_n`, which means that the index of `digit` will increment by 1.

Since `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, its length must be at least 2 to have a second character. If `str_n` has more than 2 characters, the loop can continue to the next character. Therefore, the next value of `digit` will be the third character in `str_n`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `str_n` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n` that must have at least 3 characters, digit is the third character of `str_n`**
