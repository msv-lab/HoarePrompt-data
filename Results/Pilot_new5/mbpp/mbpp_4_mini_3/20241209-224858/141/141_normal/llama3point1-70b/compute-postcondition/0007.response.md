Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the second character of `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the program has no specified return value.***
