According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `str_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must continue to the next character in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the first character of `str_n`. This means that after the current iteration, `digit` will be updated to the next character in the string `str_n`. 

To determine the new state, we need to account for the following:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `str_n` is still a non-empty string representation of `n`, but since we are moving to the next character, the length of `str_n` must be greater than the index of `digit` being processed.
- The new `digit` will be the next character in `str_n`, based on its current index.

If `digit` is the first character of `str_n`, when the loop iterates again, it will be replaced by the second character of `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must be a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.**
