Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down how the function works in relation to the specified requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input `n` is a non-negative integer, as stated in the assertions and comments.

3. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - The function converts the integer `n` to its string representation `digit_str`.
   - It then creates a frequency dictionary that counts how many times each digit appears in `digit_str`. This is done using a for loop that iterates through each digit in the string.

4. **Frequency Comparison**:
   - After constructing the frequency dictionary, the program iterates over each digit and its corresponding count in the dictionary.
   - It checks if the count of occurrences (`count`) of each digit exceeds the digit's integer value (`int(digit)`). If any digit's count is greater than its value, the function returns `False`.

5. **Return Value**:
   - If all digits satisfy the condition of having a count less than or equal to their value, the function returns `True`.

6. **Validation**:
   - The program includes assertions that test various cases:
     - `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 each appear once, which is less than or equal to their respective values.
     - `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit `1` appears twice, which is greater than its value of 1.
     - `func_1(321)` returns `True` because the digits 3, 2, and 1 each appear once, which meets the condition.

Given this analysis, the function consistently adheres to the expectations set out in the problem description, making it correct for the defined problem.
