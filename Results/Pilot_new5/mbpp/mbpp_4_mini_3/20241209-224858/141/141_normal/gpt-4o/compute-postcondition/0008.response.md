According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, meaning `digit_str` contains at least one character (the string representation of a positive integer). The variable `digit` is currently the first character of `digit_str`, which means the loop has processed this character.

For the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must contain additional characters after the current `digit`. Since the loop processes each character of `digit_str` sequentially, `digit` would be updated to the next character in the string during the next iteration.

Thus, if `digit` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute again, `digit_str` must have at least 2 characters (so that there is at least a second character to process). Consequently, `digit` would be updated to the second character of `digit_str`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` must have at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`**
