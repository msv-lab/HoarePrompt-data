According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `digit_str` and its characters. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` has at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`. In the loop, `digit` takes on each character of `digit_str` sequentially. Assuming the loop has executed once, `digit` will now be the third character in the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must have at least 3 characters, and `digit` will be the third character in the string. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` has at least 3 characters, and `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`**.
