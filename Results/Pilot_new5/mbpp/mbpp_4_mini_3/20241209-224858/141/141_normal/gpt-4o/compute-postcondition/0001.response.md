The variable `frequency` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the existing values of `n` or `digit_str`, which retain their previous states. Thus, the output state includes all the relevant information.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary**.
