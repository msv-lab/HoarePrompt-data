According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n + 1`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is positive, `n + 1` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
