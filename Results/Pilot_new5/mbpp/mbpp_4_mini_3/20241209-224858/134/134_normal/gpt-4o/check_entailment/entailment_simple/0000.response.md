Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer \( n \). However, the function `func_1(n)` simply returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

To clarify, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for \( n \) (that is, coefficients of the form \( C(n, k) \) where \( k \) is even) does not equate to \( 2^{(n-1)} \). In fact, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for \( n \) can be derived from the binomial expansion and is given by \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for \( n \geq 1 \) but this does not represent the actual sum of the coefficients at even indices only.

For example, for \( n = 4 \):
- The binomial coefficients are: \( C(4, 0), C(4, 1), C(4, 2), C(4, 3), C(4, 4) \)
- Which are: \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \)
- The sum of the even-indexed coefficients (0 and 2) is \( 1 + 6 = 7 \), not \( 2^{(4-1)} = 8 \).

Thus, the implementation does not match the problem description, and it incorrectly sums the coefficients.

In conclusion, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the determination of correctness as **False**.
