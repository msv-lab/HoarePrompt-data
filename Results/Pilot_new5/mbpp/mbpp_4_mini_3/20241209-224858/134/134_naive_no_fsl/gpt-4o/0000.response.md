To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation of `func_1`.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The even index binomial coefficients for `n` can be represented as:
\[ \text{C}(n, 0) + \text{C}(n, 2) + \text{C}(n, 4) + \ldots \]
where \(\text{C}(n, k)\) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

### Provided Program
The function `func_1` is defined as:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Analyzing the Function
The current implementation returns \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is not directly related to summing even index binomial coefficients. 

**Calculation of even index binomial coefficients for `n`:**
- For `n = 4`: 
    - \(\text{C}(4, 0) + \text{C}(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7\) (Expected: 7, Returned: 8)
  
- For `n = 6`: 
    - \(\text{C}(6, 0) + \text{C}(6, 2) + \text{C}(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31\) (Expected: 31, Returned: 32)

- For `n = 2`: 
    - \(\text{C}(2, 0) = 1\) (Expected: 1, Returned: 2)

### Conclusion
The function does not correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients as per the problem description. For each test case provided, the outputs do not match the expected results derived from the binomial coefficients.

Correctness: **False**

The code fails to return the correct sums for all provided cases. For example, `func_1(4)` should return 7 instead of 8.
