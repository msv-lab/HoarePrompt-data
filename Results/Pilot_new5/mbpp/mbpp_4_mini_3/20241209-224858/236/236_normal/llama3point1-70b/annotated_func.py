#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nums` and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where `nums` is empty or contains only one element, but in these cases, the function still correctly identifies that an empty list or a single-element list is sorted.
