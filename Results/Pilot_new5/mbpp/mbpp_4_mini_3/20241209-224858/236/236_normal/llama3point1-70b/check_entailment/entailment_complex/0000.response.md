Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted. Here's the explanation:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(nums)` checks if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version (using `sorted(nums)`). If they are equal, it indicates that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description.

3. **Handling Special Cases**: The function correctly identifies that an empty list or a list with a single element is sorted since both would return `True` when compared to their sorted versions. This means it handles edge cases as specified in the annotations.

Thus, the program behaves as intended according to the problem description, providing the correct output for all potential cases that can be encountered.
