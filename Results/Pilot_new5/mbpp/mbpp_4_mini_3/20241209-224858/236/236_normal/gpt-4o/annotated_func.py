#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a sorted list of comparable elements, `i` has executed up to `len(lst) - 2`, if the list has at least 2 elements, and all elements in `lst` are less than or equal to their succeeding elements. If the list is empty or has one element, the loop does not execute, and `i` is undefined.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions for executing the loop have been met, confirming that the list is sorted and contains at least two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the list is empty or has only one element, it also returns `True`, as such lists are considered sorted.
