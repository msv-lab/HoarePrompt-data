The provided program aims to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's analyze the code and the description.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Problem Description
The problem states that the function should return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `False` otherwise. It also mentions that if the list is empty or has only one element, it should return `True`.

### Output Hints
The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted ones, while also stating that empty lists or lists with a single element are considered sorted.

### Assessing the Code Against the Description
1. **Sorted List**: The function correctly returns `True` for lists that are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Unsorted List**: It returns `False` for lists that are not sorted, as expected.
3. **Empty List & Single Element List**: The function does not explicitly handle the cases of empty lists or lists with a single element, but it will return `True` for both of these cases due to how the loop works:
   - For an empty list, `len(lst) - 1` is `-1`, meaning the loop doesn’t execute and it returns `True`.
   - For a single-element list, `len(lst) - 1` is `0`, meaning the loop also doesn’t execute and it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases
The function appears to handle:
- An empty list: returns `True`.
- A single-element list: returns `True`.

### Verification of Output Hints
The output hints align with both the problem description and the code. They confirm the expected behavior for all cases, including edge cases.

### Conclusion
Since the code adheres to the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly determines if a list is sorted, including edge cases of empty and single-element lists, as it logically returns `True` in such scenarios without requiring additional checks.
