The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of characters where the first and last characters can be any character except 'z', and the string can be of any length. If the string `s` contains at least one 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character, the function returns `True`. If there is no 'z' in that substring, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if there is at least one 'z' in the substring between the first and last character; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, returns `True` if there is at least one 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If there is no 'z' in that substring, it returns `False`.**
