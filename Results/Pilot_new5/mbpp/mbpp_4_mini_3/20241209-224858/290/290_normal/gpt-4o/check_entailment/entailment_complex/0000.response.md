Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it always adheres to the specified criteria:

1. **Substring Checking**: The function `func_1(s)` checks for the presence of the character 'z' within the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the input string `s`. This is accomplished by using the slice `s[1:-1]`, which correctly identifies the relevant portion of the string.

2. **Return Values**: 
   - If the substring contains 'z' (i.e., `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` evaluates to `True`), the function returns `True`. This is consistent with the requirement to return `True` if 'z' is found between the start and end of the string.
   - The function returns `False` if 'z' is not present in that substring or if the length of the string is 2 or less (making the substring empty), which aligns with the requirement to return `False` in such cases.

3. **Test Cases**: 
   - The assertion `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` is valid because 'z' is present in the substring.
   - The assertion `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False` is also valid since 'z' is at the start of the string.
   - The assertion `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False` is accurate as well; there is no 'z' within the relevant substring.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic needed to check for 'z' in accordance with the problem description while appropriately handling edge cases. Therefore, it meets the requirements and is determined to be correct.
