Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **String Processing**: The function accepts a string `s` and splits it into individual words using `s.split()`. This is correct behavior as the problem requires checking for the presence of 'z' in each word.

2. **Word Length Check**: The program checks if a word has a length greater than 1 (`if len(word) > 1`). This is crucial because the problem specifically states that 'z' should be checked in words that are longer than one character, as a single character word cannot have 'z' in the middle.

3. **Substring Check**: The condition `'z' in word[1:-1]` checks for 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the word. This aligns perfectly with the problem requirement to check for 'z' except at the start and end of the word.

4. **Return Values**: If any word meets the criteria, the function returns `True`. If none of the words satisfy the condition after checking all of them, it returns `False`. This correctly reflects the logic needed to determine the presence of 'z' in the specified positions.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function's design naturally handles strings without spaces and single-character words since it only evaluates words derived from the split and checks their lengths accordingly.

Thus, the program fulfills all aspects of the problem description, ensuring that 'z' is not considered if it appears at the start or end of any word and properly checks for its presence in the appropriate substring. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is confirmed.
