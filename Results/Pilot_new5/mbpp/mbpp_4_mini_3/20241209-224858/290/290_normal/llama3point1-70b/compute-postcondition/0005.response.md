According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 2 words, the loop can execute again for the second word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `words` must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list, and its length is less than or equal to 1 or 'z' is not present in the substring of `word` starting from index 1 to the second to last index. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `words` must have at least 2 words, and `word` will need to be the second word in the list. 

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `words` is a list of words derived from `s` that must have at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list.**
