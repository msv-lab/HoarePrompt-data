Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for cases where the string has a length of less than 3 characters.

For example:
- Input: `func_1('z')` should return `False` since there are no characters between the start and end.
- Input: `func_1('az')` should also return `False` since the only 'z' is at the end.
- Input: `func_1('za')` should return `False` since the only 'z' is at the start.

However, the current implementation will raise an `IndexError` if the input string has fewer than 3 characters, as `s[1:-1]` will attempt to access an index that does not exist.

Thus, since there are cases where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the correctness is False.
