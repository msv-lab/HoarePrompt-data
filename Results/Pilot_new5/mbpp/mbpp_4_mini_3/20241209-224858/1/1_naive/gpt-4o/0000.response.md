To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` converts both input lists to sets, finds their intersection (common elements), and then returns the sorted tuple of these common elements.

2. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - It correctly identifies common elements using set intersection.
   - It sorts the common elements and returns them as a tuple, which matches the expected output format as per the assertions.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Empty lists: If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty tuple `()`, which is correct as there are no common elements.
   - No common elements: If the lists have no elements in common, the function will also return an empty tuple `()`, which is correct.
   - Lists with duplicates: The function correctly handles duplicates since sets inherently ignore duplicates.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description. All provided assertions and edge cases work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
