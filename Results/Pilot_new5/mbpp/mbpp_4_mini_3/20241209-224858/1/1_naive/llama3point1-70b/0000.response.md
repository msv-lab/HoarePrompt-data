Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input lists (or tuples). It converts both lists (or tuples) into sets, which allows for efficient calculation of their intersection using the `&` operator. The result is then converted back into a tuple, as specified in the problem description.

The function would work correctly for various cases, including:
1. When both lists are empty, it would return an empty tuple.
2. When one list is empty and the other contains elements, it would return an empty tuple, as there can be no shared elements.
3. When both lists contain some elements with no shared elements, it would return an empty tuple.
4. When both lists have all elements in common, it would return a tuple containing those elements.
5. When the lists contain duplicate elements, the output would still be correct as sets automatically handle duplicates.

Since I cannot find a case where the function does not perform as intended according to the problem description, I conclude that it is correct.
