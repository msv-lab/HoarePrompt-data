The provided Python program is supposed to find the shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` does this by converting the lists into sets and then using the intersection operator `&` to find common elements, which it then sorts and returns as a tuple.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, the code seems to fulfill the requirement of returning a sorted tuple of common elements between the two lists. If there are no common elements, it will return an empty tuple, which is also in line with the description.

Next, looking at the output hints, they confirm that the function accepts two lists and returns a sorted tuple of their common elements or an empty tuple if there are none. The hints agree with the functionality of the code.

However, I need to consider potential edge cases:
1. What if one or both of the lists are empty? The function should return an empty tuple, which it currently does since the intersection of a set with an empty set is an empty set.
2. If both lists contain the same elements, the function should return a sorted tuple of those elements (which it does).
3. If the lists contain duplicates, the function will still correctly return a sorted tuple of unique common elements.

Upon reviewing the code, the output hints, and considering various edge cases, I cannot find any instance where the code does not behave as specified in the problem description. It correctly handles all mentioned scenarios.

Therefore, based on the thorough assessment:

Correctness: **True**.
