Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input (`list1` and `list2`) and aims to find the shared elements between them.

2. **Use of Sets**: By converting the lists to sets, the function efficiently computes the intersection (common elements) using the `&` operator. This ensures that only elements that are present in both lists are identified.

3. **Sorting and Tuple Conversion**: The common elements are then sorted and converted into a tuple. This matches the requirement that the result should be a sorted tuple of shared elements.

4. **Return Value**: If there are no common elements, the intersection will be empty, and thus the function will return an empty tuple `()`, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

5. **Annotated Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotation verify that the function works correctly for several scenarios, confirming that it consistently finds and returns the expected common elements.

Overall, the implementation fulfills the problem description's requirements, and the verification of the test cases confirms its correctness for the specified cases.
