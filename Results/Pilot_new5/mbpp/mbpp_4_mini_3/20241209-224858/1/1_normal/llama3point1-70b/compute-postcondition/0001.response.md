The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the common elements between the two lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and return a tuple of the elements that are common to both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, test_tup1 and test_tup2, which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the common elements between the two lists.**
