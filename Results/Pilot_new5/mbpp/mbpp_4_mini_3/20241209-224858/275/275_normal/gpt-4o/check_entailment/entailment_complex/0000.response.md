Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the size of the largest subset of the input list such that every pair in that subset is divisible by each other. 

However, the current implementation only checks if each number is divisible by any smaller number in the sorted list. This means that it only finds subsets where at least one number is divisible by another, rather than ensuring that every pair in the subset is divisible by each other.

For instance, consider the input list `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`. The largest subset according to the problem's requirement is `{5, 10, 20}`, which has a size of 3. But the program's logic may incorrectly assume that some other combinations which do not satisfy the pair divisibility condition are valid.

The program does not account for the relationships between all numbers in the subset, meaning it can incorrectly count subsets that do not adhere to the requirement of every pair being divisible by one another. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is **False**.
