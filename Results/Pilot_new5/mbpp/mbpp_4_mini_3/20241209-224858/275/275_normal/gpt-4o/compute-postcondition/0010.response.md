According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again for the previous values of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1. The current iteration is indicated by `i`, and the loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented, which means `j` will take the value `i-1` in the next iteration. So, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and `i` must be greater than 0.**
