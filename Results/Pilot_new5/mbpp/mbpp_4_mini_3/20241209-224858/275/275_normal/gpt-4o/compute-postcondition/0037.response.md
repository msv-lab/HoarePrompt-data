According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which indicates the upper limit of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 1. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `i-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Additionally, `i` remains the same since it is equal to `len(nums)`, which means the loop can still execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 2.**
