The code updates the `dp[i]` variable by comparing its current value with the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The specific value of `dp[i]` will depend on the current values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. 

Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is greater than 1, we can assume there are valid values for `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` based on the previous operations.

Assuming `dp[i]` is a certain value `v` and `dp[j]` is a corresponding value `u`, the new value of `dp[i]` will be the maximum between `v` and `u + 1`. Therefore, after this operation, `dp[i]` will either remain as `v` or be updated to `u + 1`, depending on which is larger.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1).**
