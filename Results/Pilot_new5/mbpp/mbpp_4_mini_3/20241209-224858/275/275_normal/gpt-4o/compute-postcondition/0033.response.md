Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be at least `dp[j] + 1`.***
