To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the hints given.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. It returns 0 if `nums` is empty; otherwise, it returns the maximum length of any subset of `nums` where each element in the subset is divisible by at least one other element in that subset.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function starts by checking if the list is empty. If so, it returns 0, which aligns with the problem description.
2. It sorts the numbers in ascending order. This is a reasonable step as it allows checking divisibility in a structured manner.
3. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach with an array `dp` to keep track of the size of the largest subset for each number.
4. The nested loops iterate through the sorted list, checking if the current number `nums[i]` is divisible by any of the previous numbers `nums[j]`. If it is, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. A case to consider is when all numbers in the input list are prime. For example, `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])`. In this case, the expected output should be 1, as no number is divisible by any other.
2. Another case is when the input list contains zeros, such as `func_1([0, 2, 4, 8])`. Here the expected output should be 4, as all numbers are divisible by 0, but the provided logic will be incorrect since it doesnâ€™t handle zero correctly in terms of divisibility logic.
3. The original problem statement implies that there must be a valid pair of divisible numbers in the subset, but the implementation can return a value larger than 1 for incompatible sets.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function returns 0 for empty inputs and mentions the max size of a subset where divisibility is satisfied. The hints do not explicitly account for edge cases such as the presence of zeros or all primes.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the program against the problem description and considering potential edge cases, it's clear that the program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly with zero and prime numbers.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to return the expected output for certain cases, such as when the input consists solely of prime numbers or includes zero, leading to incorrect handling of divisibility logic.
