Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, with all elements initialized to 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subset for each index, with each `dp[i]` reflecting the maximum length of any divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.**
