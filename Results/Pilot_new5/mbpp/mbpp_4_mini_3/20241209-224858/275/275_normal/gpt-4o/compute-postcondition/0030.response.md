According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` in the range of `i`. The variable `i` is currently set to `len(nums) + 1`, which means the loop will attempt to iterate from 0 to `len(nums)`. However, since `j` has already iterated through all indices from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, it implies that `j` is currently at `len(nums)`, which is not valid for the next iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the `i` variable should be adjusted to a value that reflects the maximum index of `nums`, which is `len(nums)`. Additionally, `j` should be reset to a value that allows the loop to start iterating. Therefore, `j` should be set to 0 to start the loop again.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` must be equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**
