To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we start by identifying the variables involved and their initial states based on the given information:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1.
- `i` is len(nums).
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Here, `dp[i]` is being updated based on the maximum value between its current value (`dp[i]`) and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. 

1. **Impact of the code**: 
   - The value of `dp[i]` will change. It will either remain the same as it was or increase by 1 based on the value of `dp[j]`.

2. **Previous values**:
   - `dp[i]`: Initially equals 1 (since `dp` is initialized to 1 for all indices).
   - `dp[j]`: Also equals 1, as this holds for any `j` due to the same initialization.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(1, 1 + 1)` which equals `max(1, 2)`, resulting in `dp[i]` becoming 2.

After executing the code, the relevant state information remains as follows:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements.
- `dp` now contains at least one element that is 2 (specifically `dp[len(nums)]`).
- `i` remains equal to len(nums).
- `j` remains 1.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements; `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 with `dp[i]` updated to 2; `i` is len(nums); `j` is 1.**
