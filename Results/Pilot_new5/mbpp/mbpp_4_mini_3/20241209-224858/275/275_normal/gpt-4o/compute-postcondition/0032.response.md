The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]`. 

Since `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, the new value of `dp[i]` will be greater than or equal to `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `nums`, `j`, `i`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state includes the updated value of `dp[i]`, which is now at least `dp[j] + 1`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is now at least `dp[j] + 1`.**
