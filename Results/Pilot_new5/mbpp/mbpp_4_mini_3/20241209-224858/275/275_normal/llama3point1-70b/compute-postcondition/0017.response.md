According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of the `nums` list. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index the loop executed, which is `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become `len(nums)`. Furthermore, the `dp` list would still have the values based on the previous states, so it remains unchanged as it does not depend on the current index `i`.

State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, and `i` is `len(nums)`**
