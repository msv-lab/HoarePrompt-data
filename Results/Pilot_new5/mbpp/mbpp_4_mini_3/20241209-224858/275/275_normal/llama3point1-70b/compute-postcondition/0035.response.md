The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` can take on any value from `0` to `i-1`. The specific value of `j` is not provided, but it implies that there will be a comparison with at least one value of `dp[j]`. The initial state of `dp` remains unchanged except for the specific index `i`, which will be modified based on the current values of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State will indicate that `dp[i]` is now modified to reflect the maximum calculated.

Output State: **`dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subsets, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` must be less than `i`, `dp[i]` is updated to be max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) for some j in the range 0 to i-1.**
