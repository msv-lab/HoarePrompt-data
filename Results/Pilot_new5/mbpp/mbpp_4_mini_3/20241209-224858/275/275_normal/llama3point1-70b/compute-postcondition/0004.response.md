The variable `dp` is assigned a list that contains the value `1` repeated for the number of elements in `nums`. Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, the length of `nums` is a positive integer greater than 0. Therefore, `dp` will be a list of length equal to that of `nums`, filled with the value `1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s.**
