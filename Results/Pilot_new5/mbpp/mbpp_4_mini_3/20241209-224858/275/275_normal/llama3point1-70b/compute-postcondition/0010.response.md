According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which defines the range of the loop. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` has been updated based on the divisibility condition between `nums[1]` and `nums[0]`, but the actual value of `j` is not specified. However, since the loop iterates over `range(i)`, the value of `j` would have incremented from its initial value.

If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time as long as `j` is less than `i`. Therefore, we assume `j` was equal to `i - 1` at the end of the last iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `j` will need to be incremented to `i`, which means the loop has completed its current range. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s, where `dp[1]` is updated to 2 if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `i` must be greater than `j`.**
