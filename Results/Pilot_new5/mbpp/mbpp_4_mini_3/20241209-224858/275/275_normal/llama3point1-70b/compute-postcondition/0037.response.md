According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`, checking the conditions for each `j`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a specific value, and for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented. 

Thus, if the loop executes for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, the next iteration would involve `j` ranging from `0` to `i` (where `i` is incremented). Therefore, `j` will be `i` in the next iteration, and the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than `0`.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can only express that the next value of `i` should be greater than `0` for the loop to continue.

State: **`dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subsets, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`**
