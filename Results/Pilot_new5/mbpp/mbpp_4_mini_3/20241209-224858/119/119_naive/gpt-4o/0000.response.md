Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as arguments and returns a tuple consisting of the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases given:

1. `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
2. `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is correct.
3. `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which is also correct.

Since all test cases and the function definition align with the problem's requirements, there are no potential edge cases or errors found, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
