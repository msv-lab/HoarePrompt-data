The provided program takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```

The program simply returns the values of `b` and `a` in a tuple. Based on the problem description, this seems to be correct. The function will take any two inputs (of any data type) and return them in the specified order.

Next, I will consider the output hints: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b` of any data type and returns a tuple containing the values in the order of `b` followed by `a`. There are no constraints on the type of `a` and `b`, allowing for integers, floats, strings, lists, or any other objects.

Both the code and the output hints agree on the functionality. The function will return a tuple regardless of the data types of `a` and `b`, and there are no edge cases or missing logic that I can identify based on the description and hints provided. The function behaves correctly for all valid inputs as described.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code meets the problem requirements in every scenario, accurately returning a tuple with the second argument followed by the first.
