Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number (`b`) followed by the first number (`a`). 

The annotations in the code confirm that the function is designed to return the values in the specific order required (i.e., `b` first and then `a`). Additionally, there are no constraints on the data types of `a` and `b`, which allows for versatility in the function's usage, as it can handle any data type including integers, floats, strings, lists, or other objects.

Thus, the function satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and consistently returns the expected output.
