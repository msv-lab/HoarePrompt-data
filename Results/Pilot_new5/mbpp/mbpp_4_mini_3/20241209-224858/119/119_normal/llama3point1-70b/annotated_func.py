#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any two values (they can be of any data type).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in the order of b, a, where a and b can be any two values of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b` of any data type, and returns a tuple containing the values in the order of `b` followed by `a`. There are no constraints on the type of `a` and `b`, so they can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, lists, or any other objects.
