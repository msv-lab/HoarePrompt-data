The value of `max_diff` is assigned the result of `max_val - min_val`. The variables `min_val` and `max_val` represent the minimum and maximum integers in the list `arr`, respectively. Therefore, `max_diff` will be the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in `arr`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
