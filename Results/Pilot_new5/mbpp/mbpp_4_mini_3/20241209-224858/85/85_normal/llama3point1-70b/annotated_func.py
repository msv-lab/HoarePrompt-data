#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr' of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions, which do not handle empty lists. Therefore, the function assumes that the input list will always contain at least one integer.
