Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach works under the following conditions:

1. The array contains at least two elements: The maximum and minimum values can be found, and the difference will be meaningful.
2. The array contains negative numbers: The function will still return the correct maximum difference, as it considers the minimum and maximum values.
3. The array contains all identical elements: In this case, the result will be 0, which accurately reflects that there is no difference between the elements.

Since no edge cases are overlooked, and the function works correctly for all potential inputs, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
