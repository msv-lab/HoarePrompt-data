#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11], indicating that month has 30 days, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (where `month` must be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` has 30 days (specifically, if `month` is April, June, September, or November). For all other months, including those that have 31 days and February, it returns `False`.
