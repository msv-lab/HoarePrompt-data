Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it only checks if the month is in the list of months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). However, the problem description requires the function to check whether a given month contains 30 days or not, which implies that the function should also return false for months that have more than 30 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and for February (which has 28 or 29 days).

The current implementation only returns `True` for months that have 30 days and does not correctly handle the cases for months that do not have 30 days. For instance:
- For month 1 (January), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 2 (February), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 3 (March), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 4 (April), the function will return `True`, which is correct.
- For month 5 (May), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 6 (June), the function will return `True`, which is correct.
- For month 7 (July), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 8 (August), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 9 (September), the function will return `True`, which is correct.
- For month 10 (October), the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- For month 11 (November), the function will return `True`, which is correct.
- For month 12 (December), the function will return `False`, which is correct.

However, the problem description asks for a complete assessment of whether a month contains 30 days or not, including recognizing that February does not contain 30 days, which the program does not explicitly check against. Therefore, the program is incomplete as it does not handle the requirement to check for months not in the 30-day category accurately.
