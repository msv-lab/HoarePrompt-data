The code assigns a list of integers `[4, 6, 9, 11]` to the variable `thirty_days_months`. This does not change the previous state of the variable `month`, which remains an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive). Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive); `thirty_days_months` is [4, 6, 9, 11]**
