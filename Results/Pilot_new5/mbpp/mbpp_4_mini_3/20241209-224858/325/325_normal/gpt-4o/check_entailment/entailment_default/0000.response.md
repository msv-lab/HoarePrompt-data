Let's break down the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** The function must check whether the given month number (1 to 12) has 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts an integer `month` (between 1 and 12 inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11), indicating that those months have 30 days. It returns `False` for all other months, including those with 31 days and February, which has 28 or 29 days.

**Initial assessment:**
- The function correctly defines a set of months with 30 days and checks if the input `month` is in that set.
- The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and February (28 or 29 days) are correctly covered by returning `False`.

**Checking against output hints:**
- The output hints correctly indicate which months have 30 days and confirm that the function should return `True` for those months.
- It also correctly states that the function will return `False` for the other months, including February.

**Potential edge cases:**
1. Input values `0` or `13` are not included in the range of valid month numbers (1 to 12). The function does not handle these inputs, which could lead to unintended behavior or errors. The problem description does not specify how to handle out-of-range values, but typically functions should validate their input parameters.

**Conclusion:**
The function does not account for invalid month inputs (like `0` or `13`). Given that the problem description does not specify behavior for invalid inputs and the function does not handle them, this leads to a situation where the function can behave incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, which means:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle invalid month numbers (such as `0` or `13`), which demonstrates that it does not meet the requirements for all inputs as specified.
