The program is not correct according to the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The problem description states that the function must check whether a given month, represented by an integer from 1 to 12, contains 30 days. The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

2. The provided program correctly identifies that months 4, 6, 9, and 11 have 30 days and returns `True` for those months. However, it erroneously returns `False` for February (2), which is not a month that has 30 days but is a valid month number. Thus, it correctly identifies February and the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) as having more than 30 days.

3. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function is tested against specific cases, but they do not cover all possible months. The function does not handle the case correctly for months that have 31 days or February, correctly returning `False` for those months.

4. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` only if the month has 30 days, which it does correctly for April, June, September, and November. However, it fails the requirement to account for the fact that the program should not return `True` for months that don't exist or months with more or fewer days.

In summary, the function does not handle the verification properly for all month inputs correctly as per the problem description, leading to an incomplete solution.

Correctness: **False**
