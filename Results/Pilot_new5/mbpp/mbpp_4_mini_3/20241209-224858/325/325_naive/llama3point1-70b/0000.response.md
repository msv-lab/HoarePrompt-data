Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. It defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the month numbers that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). The program then checks if the input `month` is in this list. 

The function handles all valid month numbers correctly:
- For inputs 1 (January), 2 (February), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), 12 (December), it returns `False`, which is correct since these months do not have 30 days.
- For inputs 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November), it returns `True`, which is also correct.

It correctly assumes that the input will be within the range of 1 to 12, as per the problem description. Thus, there are no edge cases to consider that would cause incorrect behavior.
