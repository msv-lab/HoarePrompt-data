#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`, all even indexed elements can be any integers, and all odd indexed elements must be odd. If `lst` is empty, `i` is not applicable and `lst` has no elements.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the code executed successfully without any conditions preventing it, regardless of the contents of the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if any even integers are found at odd indices; otherwise, it returns True.
