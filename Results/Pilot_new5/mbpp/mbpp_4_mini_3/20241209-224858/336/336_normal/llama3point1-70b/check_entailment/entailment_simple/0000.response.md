The program is intended to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. However, the implementation has a logical flaw.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The loop iterates through each index `i` of `lst`.
2. For each odd index (i.e., when `i % 2 != 0`), the program checks if the number at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding an even number at any odd index, it returns `True`.

However, the program does not check whether odd-indexed numbers are indeed odd. Instead, it only checks that they are not even. This means that the function would return `True` for a list where odd-indexed elements are negative odd numbers, or any odd numbers, or even zeroes, as long as they are not even numbers. 

For example:
- If `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the odd index (1) has an even number (2), so it returns `False` — this part is correct.
- However, if `lst` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the odd index (1) has an odd number (3), so it returns `True` — which is expected.
- If `lst` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the odd indices (1, 3, 5) have odd numbers (1, 3, 5), so it returns `True`. This also does not guarantee that all odd indices contain odd numbers, which is a requirement.

Thus, the logic fails in general cases where odd indices should contain odd numbers specifically, not just that they contain numbers that are not even.

Correctness: **False**
