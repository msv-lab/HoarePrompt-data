To assess the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. If all odd indexed elements are odd integers, the function should return True; otherwise, it should return False. If the list is empty or has only one element, the function should return True since there are no odd indexed elements to check.

### Provided Function:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index), incrementing by 2 to check only the odd indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - It checks if the value at each of these positions is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds any even number, it immediately returns False.
   - If it finishes the loop without finding any evens, it returns True.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty (`[]`), the function will correctly return True because the loop will not run.
   - If the list has only one element (`[2]` or `[1]`), the function will also correctly return True as there are no odd indexed elements to check.
   - However, if the list has two elements (`[1, 2]`), the function will check index 1 and return False, which is correct as index 1 contains an even number.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function returns False if any of the elements at odd indices are even integers. 
- If all odd indexed elements are odd integers, it returns True.
- If the list is empty or has only one element, the function will return True, as there are no odd indexed elements to check.

### Agreement Check:
The output hints align well with the logic of the function. It confirms that:
- The function accurately identifies even numbers at odd indices and returns False.
- It also correctly handles cases of empty lists or lists with one element by returning True.

### Conclusion:
The function adheres to the problem description for all potential cases outlined in the description, and the output hints corroborate the function's behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
