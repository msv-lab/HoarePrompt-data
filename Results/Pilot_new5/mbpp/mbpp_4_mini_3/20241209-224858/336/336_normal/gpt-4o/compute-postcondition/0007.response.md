According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `lst` starting from 1 to the length of the list, stepping by 2. This means it will access only the odd indices of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, which means the loop has accessed the element at index 3 of `lst`, and it is given that this element is an odd integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 5. We also need to ensure that the loop can still execute again, which depends on the length of `lst`. Since `lst` has at least 4 elements, the next condition to check is whether `i` (which will be 5) is still less than the length of `lst`. 

Since the loop is designed to iterate while `i` is less than the length of the list, for the loop to execute again, `len(lst)` must be greater than 5.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 5, and the element at index `i` of `lst` must be an odd integer.**
