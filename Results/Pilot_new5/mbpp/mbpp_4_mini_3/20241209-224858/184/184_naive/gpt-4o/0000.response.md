Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly filters odd numbers from the provided list of integers. It uses a list comprehension that iterates over each number in the input list and returns only those numbers that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., odd numbers). The assertions provided also indicate that the function produces the expected outputs for the given test cases. Since there are no apparent edge cases or input scenarios where the function would fail to meet the problem requirements, the implementation is correct.
