Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to filter out odd numbers, but it is doing the opposite by returning only the odd numbers. The expression `num % 2 != 0` returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which means the function will only include odd numbers in the result. 

For example, if we input the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the expected output should be `[2, 4]` (i.e., filtering out odd numbers). However, the program will return `[1, 3]`, which does not satisfy the requirement to filter odd numbers. Therefore, the function does not work as expected.
