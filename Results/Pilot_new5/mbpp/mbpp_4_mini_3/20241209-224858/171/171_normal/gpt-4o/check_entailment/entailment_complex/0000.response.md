Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of the given integer `n` is odd by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as intended for the tested integer inputs:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, indicating that 12 is not odd (it is even).
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, indicating that 7 is indeed odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, indicating that 10 is not odd (it is even).

While it is true that the program does not handle non-integer types, the problem description specifically states the need to find the parity of a given number without any mention of handling type checks. Therefore, the function fulfills its required purpose accurately based on the integer input provided.

In conclusion, the function meets the expectations set by the problem description for the cases defined, which is why the program is deemed correct.
