Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines the parity of an integer `n`. It checks if `n` is odd by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 

Here's the reasoning:

- The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of `n` by `2`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will equal `1`, and thus `n % 2 != 0` will evaluate to `True`.
- Conversely, if `n` is even, `n % 2` will equal `0`, making `n % 2 != 0` evaluate to `False`.

The function returns `True` if the input integer `n` is odd, and `False` if it is even, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

There are no edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation, as it handles all integer inputs correctly. Hence, the function behaves correctly as specified.
