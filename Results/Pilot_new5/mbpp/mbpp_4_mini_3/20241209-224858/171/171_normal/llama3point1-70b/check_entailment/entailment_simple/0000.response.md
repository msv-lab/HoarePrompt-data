Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. The function `func_1` uses the expression `n % 2 != 0` to check for oddness. This expression evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., if there is a remainder when `n` is divided by 2), and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., if there is no remainder).

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts an integer `n` as input, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Logic**: The condition `n % 2 != 0` directly checks the parity of `n`. If `n` is odd, it returns `True`, which matches the requirement to identify odd parity.
3. **Output**: The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), which is the expected output for a check on parity.

Thus, the function works for all potential integer inputs, correctly identifying odd integers as odd, and it strictly adheres to the requirements of the problem description.
