Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. 

- The function uses the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the remainder of `n` when divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If this condition is true, it means `n` is odd; otherwise, it is even.
- The assertions provided confirm the correctness of the function for specific test cases:
  - For `n = 12` (even), it returns `False`, which is expected.
  - For `n = 7` (odd), it returns `True`, which is expected.
  - For `n = 10` (even), it again returns `False`, which is expected.

Since the logic correctly identifies the parity for the provided test cases and does not have any edge cases that could cause it to fail (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or non-integer types are not specified in the problem, and the function assumes it will receive valid integer inputs), we conclude that the function behaves as intended.

Thus, no potential cases where the function does not meet the problem description were found, confirming its correctness.
