Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses list comprehension to iterate through each sublist of strings in the given list of lists, applying the `sorted` function to each sublist with the `key=str.lower` argument. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

The program will handle various cases, including:
- Sublists with mixed case strings (e.g., `["Banana", "apple", "orange"]` will be sorted to `["apple", "Banana", "orange"]`).
- Sublists with strings that are already in order (e.g., `["a", "b", "c"]` remains `["a", "b", "c"]`).
- Sublists with strings containing numbers (e.g., `["2", "1", "10"]` will be sorted to `["1", "10", "2"]`).
- Sublists that are empty (e.g., `[]` remains `[]`).

There are no edge cases found where the program fails to meet the requirements; it correctly sorts each sublist irrespective of case and handles all types of string inputs as described. Thus, the implementation is correct.
