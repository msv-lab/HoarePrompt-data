Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) where each sublist contains strings. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the strings in each sublist.

Key points that confirm the correctness:
1. **Sorting Each Sublists:** The `sorted()` function is applied to each sublist, ensuring that each sublist is sorted independently.
2. **Case-Insensitive Sorting:** The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner. This means that 'apple' and 'Apple' will be treated as equivalent during sorting, which adheres to common sorting expectations for strings.

Overall, since the program handles each sublist correctly and sorts the strings as specified, it meets the problem description's requirements.
