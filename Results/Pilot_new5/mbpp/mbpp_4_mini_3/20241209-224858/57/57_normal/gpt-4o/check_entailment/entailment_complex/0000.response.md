Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings. Specifically, the output of the assertions does not match the expected results based on the problem description.

1. The first assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
   ```
   The expected output should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange']]`, but the actual output from `func_1` would be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is incorrect as the third sublist should not have duplicates or be reordered improperly.

2. The second assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
   ```
   Here, the expected output `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` does not match the output of `func_1`, which would sort the strings incorrectly, moving 'black' to a different position.

3. The third assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]
   ```
   Again, the expected output does not match what the function would return, as it properly sorts but does not conform to the exact expected output as required.

In summary, the function does not meet the problem description because it does not correctly sort each sublist as specified, leading to incorrect outputs in the assertions provided.
