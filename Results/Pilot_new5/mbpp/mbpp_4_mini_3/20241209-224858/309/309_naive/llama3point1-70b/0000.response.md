Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes duplicates. If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters in the string were the same. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

1. An empty string (`s = ""`), which will return `True` since there are no differing characters.
2. A string with identical characters (e.g., `s = "aaaa"`), which will return `True`.
3. A string with different characters (e.g., `s = "abc"`), which will return `False`.

Since it handles these cases correctly, the program is correct as per the problem description.
