Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns `True` when the input string `s` is empty, which is not aligned with the requirement to check whether "all the characters are the same." 

The problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings. If an empty string is considered to have "all the same characters" (since there are no characters to compare), then the program's behavior is acceptable. However, if the intent is to check for uniformity among characters, an empty string should logically return `False` instead.

To summarize:
- The function returns `True` for an empty string, which is not universally accepted behavior for the check described in the problem.
- Given this lack of clarity in handling empty strings, the current implementation does not consistently follow the expectations set by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
