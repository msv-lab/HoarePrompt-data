Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to check if all characters in the input string `s` are the same.

2. **Set Creation**: The program uses `set(s)`, which creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`. If all characters in `s` are the same, the set will contain only one unique character.

3. **Length Comparison**: The expression `len(set(s)) == 1` checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, this means all characters in the string are identical, and thus the function will return `True`. If there are different characters, the length of the set will be greater than 1, and the function will return `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function will also correctly handle edge cases:
   - If the string is empty (`s = ""`), the set will also be empty, and `len(set(s))` will return 0, leading to a correct return of `False`.
   - If the string has only one character (e.g., `s = "a"`), the set will contain one element, and it will correctly return `True`.

5. **Efficiency**: The use of a set ensures that the function is efficient, since it only requires a single pass through the string to determine the unique characters.

Overall, the program accurately checks if all characters in the string are the same as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
