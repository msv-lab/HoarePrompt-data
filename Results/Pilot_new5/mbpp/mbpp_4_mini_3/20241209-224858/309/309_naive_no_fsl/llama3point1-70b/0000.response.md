Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes duplicate characters. If the length of this set is 1, it implies that all characters in the string are identical.

Let's evaluate potential cases:

1. **Single Character String**: For input `s = "a"`, the set will be `{'a'}`, and the length is 1. The function returns `True`, which is correct.
  
2. **All Same Characters**: For input `s = "aaaa"`, the set will be `{'a'}`, and the length is 1. The function returns `True`, which is correct.

3. **Different Characters**: For input `s = "abc"`, the set will be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`, and the length is 3. The function returns `False`, which is correct.

4. **Mixed Characters**: For input `s = "aabb"`, the set will be `{'a', 'b'}`, and the length is 2. The function returns `False`, which is correct.

5. **Empty String**: For input `s = ""`, the set will be an empty set `{}`, and the length is 0. The function returns `False`, which may be debatable but still correctly implies that not all characters (since there are none) are the same.

The function handles all these cases appropriately as per the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
