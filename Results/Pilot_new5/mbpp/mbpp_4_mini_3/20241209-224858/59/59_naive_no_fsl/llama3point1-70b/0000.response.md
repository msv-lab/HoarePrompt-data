Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It achieves this by concatenating the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorting the resulting list with the `sorted()` function.

The program has been verified against various potential cases:

1. **All lists empty**: `func_1([], [], [])` returns `[]`, which is correct.
2. **One list empty**: `func_1([1, 3], [], [2])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
3. **All lists with elements**: `func_1([3, 1], [2], [4])` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.
4. **Lists with duplicate elements**: `func_1([1, 2, 2], [2], [1])` returns `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`, which is correct.

In all cases examined, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
