Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It takes three input lists, combines them into one using list concatenation, and then sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function produces the expected sorted output for various test cases, including handling duplicates correctly.

Since the function works as described in the problem statement and correctly handles the provided test cases, it can be concluded that the implementation is correct. I couldn't find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of merging and sorting the lists. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
