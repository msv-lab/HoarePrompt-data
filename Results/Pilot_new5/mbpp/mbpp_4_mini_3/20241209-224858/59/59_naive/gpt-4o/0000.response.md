Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It combines the lists using the `+` operator, which concatenates them, and then sorts the resulting combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function. 

The assertions provided test various cases, including lists with duplicate values and lists of varying lengths. The outputs from the assertions match the expected sorted merged lists:

1. The first assertion combines three lists and sorts them correctly.
2. The second assertion also combines and sorts three lists with some duplicates seamlessly.
3. The third assertion handles larger lists with various integer values and sorts them accurately as well.

There are no identified edge cases or scenarios in which the function fails to meet the problem description of merging and sorting three lists, confirming its correctness.
