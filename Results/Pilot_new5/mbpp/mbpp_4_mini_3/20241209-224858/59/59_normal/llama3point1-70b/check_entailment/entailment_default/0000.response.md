The provided Python program is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` utilizes the built-in `sorted` function to combine the three lists (list1, list2, and list3) and then sorts the resulting list.

### Initial Assessment:
The code appears to correctly follow the problem description because it combines the three lists and sorts them as required. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Lists**: If any or all of the lists are empty, the function should still work correctly and return an empty list or a sorted list of the non-empty inputs.
2. **All Lists Empty**: If all three lists are empty, the result should also be an empty list.
3. **Duplicates**: If the lists contain duplicate values, the function should still return a sorted list that includes all instances of those duplicates.
4. **Negative Numbers**: The function should also correctly handle lists containing negative numbers, ensuring that they are placed correctly in the sorted order.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function accepts three parameters, which are lists of integers, and returns a new list containing all integers from the combined lists sorted in ascending order. The hints do not indicate any edge cases where the function might fail.

### Conclusion:
Since the code correctly merges and sorts the lists as per the problem description and it handles the edge cases appropriately based on the provided hints, I do not see any potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
