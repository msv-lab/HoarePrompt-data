The variable `sorted_list` is assigned the value of the sorted version of `combined_list`. The state of `combined_list` remains the same as it was initially defined to hold all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. The sorting operation does not affect any of the original lists.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, `sorted_list` is the sorted version of `combined_list`.**
