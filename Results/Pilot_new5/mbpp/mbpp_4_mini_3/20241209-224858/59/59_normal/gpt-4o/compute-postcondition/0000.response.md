The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of `list1 + list2 + list3`, which is the concatenation of the three lists. The values of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new variable `combined_list`, which contains all the integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in a single list.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.**
