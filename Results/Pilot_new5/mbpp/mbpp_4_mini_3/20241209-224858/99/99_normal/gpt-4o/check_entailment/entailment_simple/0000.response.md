Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that removes characters with odd index values from a given string. However, the function `func_1` is designed to return characters at even indices instead. 

To clarify:

- The odd-indexed characters in the strings 'abcdef', 'python', 'data', and 'lambs' are 'b', 'h', 'a', and 'a', respectively.
- The expected output according to the problem description should therefore remove those characters, resulting in 'ace', 'pto', 'dt', and 'lms'.

However, the function is logically constructed to retain even-indexed characters instead, which does not align with the requirement to remove characters with odd indices. Thus, the function does not correctly fulfill the task as specified in the problem description.
