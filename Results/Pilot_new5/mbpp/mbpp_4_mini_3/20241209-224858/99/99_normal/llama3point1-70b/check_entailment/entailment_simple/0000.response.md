Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to remove characters with odd index values from a given string. 

Here's an explanation of how the program fulfills this requirement:

1. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the string `s` with a step of 2, starting from index 0 (`range(0, len(s), 2)`). This means it selects only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
3. The `join` method is then utilized to concatenate the selected characters into a new string.
4. As a result, the program effectively collects all characters at even positions while omitting those at odd positions, which directly aligns with the problem requirement of removing characters at odd index values.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the task of removing characters with odd index values from the given string, confirming that it meets the problem description.
