Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly extracts the last character from each string in the given tuple, it fails to handle the case where any of the strings in the tuple is empty. In such a scenario, attempting to access the last character of an empty string would raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the program does not account for all potential cases as specified in the problem description, making it incorrect.
