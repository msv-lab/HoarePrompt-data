Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function must extract only the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `strings`, which is specified to be a tuple of strings.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `strings`.
3. For each string, it accesses the last character using the index `-1` (`s[-1]`), which is the appropriate way to retrieve the last element in a string in Python.
4. The result is a list containing these last characters.

Given that the function processes each string in the tuple correctly and returns a list of their last characters, it meets the specifications outlined in the problem description without any exceptions or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
