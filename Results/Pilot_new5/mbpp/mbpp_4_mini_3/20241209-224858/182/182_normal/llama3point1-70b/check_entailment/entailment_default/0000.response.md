The program is designed to extract the last character from each string in a tuple. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through each string and retrieves the last character using indexing.

Initially, the code appears to fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it aims to return a list containing the last character of each string in the provided tuple.

However, there are some edge cases that the program does not handle. Specifically, if any string in the tuple is empty, accessing `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`, which is a significant flaw that violates the expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

The output hints confirm this issue by stating that the function does not handle cases where any string in the tuple is empty, leading to an `IndexError`. This aligns with my assessment that the code fails under certain conditions.

Since the program does not correctly handle the edge case of empty strings, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
