To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description.

The problem states: "Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple."

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples.
2. **Zipping Tuples**: The `zip(*tuples)` effectively transposes the input tuple of tuples, allowing us to group the elements by their index across the inner tuples.
3. **Calculating Averages**: For each group of corresponding values, it calculates the average by using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty tuple of tuples (i.e., `()`, or `tuple()`), the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when it attempts to compute the average since `len(tuples)` will be 0.
2. **Non-numeric Values**: If any of the values within the tuples are non-numeric (e.g., strings), the program will throw a `TypeError` during the summation.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential edge case where an empty tuple is provided as input, the program will not handle this situation, leading to an error. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description's requirement for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
