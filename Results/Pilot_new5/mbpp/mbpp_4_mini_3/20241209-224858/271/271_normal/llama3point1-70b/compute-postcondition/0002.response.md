Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples, each containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. Specifically, it sums the values at each position and divides by the number of inner tuples. If the input tuple is empty, it will return an empty list, and if any inner tuple contains non-numeric values, it may raise a TypeError during the calculation.**
