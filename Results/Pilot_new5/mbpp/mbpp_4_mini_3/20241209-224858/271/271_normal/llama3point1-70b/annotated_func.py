#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages for each position in the inner tuples of the tuple 'tuples', calculated by summing the values at each position and dividing by the number of inner tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples, each containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. Specifically, it sums the values at each position and divides by the number of inner tuples. If the input tuple is empty, it will return an empty list, and if any inner tuple contains non-numeric values, it may raise a TypeError during the calculation.
