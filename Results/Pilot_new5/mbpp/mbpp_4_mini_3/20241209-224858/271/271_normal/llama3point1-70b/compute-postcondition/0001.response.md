The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values. After executing the function body, it returns a list of averages for each position in the inner tuples of `tuples`, which is calculated by summing the values at each position and dividing by the number of inner tuples. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages corresponding to each position in the inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each position in the inner tuples.**
