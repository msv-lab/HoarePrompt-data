The `averages` list is appended with the value of `avg`. The value of `avg` is calculated as the average of `elements_at_position`, and since `elements_at_position` is derived from the first elements of the inner tuples in `tuples`, we can say that `avg` is based on those values. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is the average of `elements_at_position`, `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.**
