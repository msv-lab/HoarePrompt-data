According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. The loop will execute if `num_elements` is at least 1. The state before the loop indicates that `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, which suggests that it contains inner tuples of numeric values. Since `num_elements` is defined as the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`, we need to ensure that this inner tuple exists and has a length greater than 0.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `tuples` must contain at least one inner tuple.
- `num_elements` must be at least 1.
- `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
