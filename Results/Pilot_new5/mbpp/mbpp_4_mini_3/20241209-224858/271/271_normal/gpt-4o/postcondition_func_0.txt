The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of averages, where each element in the list corresponds to the average of the values at the same position across all inner tuples. The function assumes that all inner tuples are of the same length and that there is at least one inner tuple present. If the input is invalid (e.g., if tuples is empty or contains empty inner tuples), the function may raise an error due to division by zero or index out of range, which is not handled in the code.
