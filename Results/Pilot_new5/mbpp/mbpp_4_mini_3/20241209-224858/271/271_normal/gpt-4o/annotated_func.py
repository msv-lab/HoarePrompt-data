#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the averages of each position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, with a length equal to `num_elements`.
    return averages
    #The program returns the list 'averages' which contains the averages of each position across all inner tuples in 'tuples', with a length equal to 'num_elements'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of averages, where each element in the list corresponds to the average of the values at the same position across all inner tuples. The function assumes that all inner tuples are of the same length and that there is at least one inner tuple present. If the input is invalid (e.g., if tuples is empty or contains empty inner tuples), the function may raise an error due to division by zero or index out of range, which is not handled in the code.
