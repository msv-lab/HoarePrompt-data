The code `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` calculates the average of the second elements of the inner tuples in `tuples`. 

1. The variable `elements_at_position` is already a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple from `tuples`.
2. The `sum(elements_at_position)` will compute the total of the second elements.
3. The `len(tuples)` gives the number of inner tuples, which is at least 1 due to the constraint on `tuples`.
4. Thus, `avg` will be calculated as the total of the second elements divided by the number of inner tuples, which indicates that `avg` will be a numeric value.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is a numeric value equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.**
