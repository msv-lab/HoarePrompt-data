To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem description and check if the provided code meets the requirement of extracting the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

### Problem description:
The task is to extract element-wise tuples from two given tuples.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
- The function uses `zip` to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
- It then applies the bitwise AND operation (`&`) to each pair of elements.

### Evaluation:
The problem description does not specify that the function should perform a bitwise AND operation. It only states that it should "extract the elementwise and tuples." This could imply a need for a simple combination of the elements, possibly returning the pairs or a different operation. 

#### Potential Case:
If we provide two tuples with integers:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```
The expected output based on a broad interpretation of "extracting elementwise tuples" could be:
```
((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)) 
```
However, the provided code will return:
```python
(0, 0, 0)  # because 1 & 4 = 0, 2 & 5 = 0, 3 & 6 = 0
```

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases (it interprets "elementwise" incorrectly by applying a bitwise AND), it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
