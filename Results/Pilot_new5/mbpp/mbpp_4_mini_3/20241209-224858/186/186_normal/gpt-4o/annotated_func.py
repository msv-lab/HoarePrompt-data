#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of elements from tuple1 and tuple2, paired by their respective indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple that contains the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it only processes the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple.
