The function `func_1` accepts parameters `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, paired by their respective indices. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of elements from the two input tuples, paired by their respective indices.**
