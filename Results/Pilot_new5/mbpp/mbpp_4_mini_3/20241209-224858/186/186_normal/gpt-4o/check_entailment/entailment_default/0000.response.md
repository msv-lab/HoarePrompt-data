To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to extract element-wise results from two given tuples, performing a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements. 

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple that contains the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it only processes the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple.

### Initial Assessment:
The code utilizes the `zip()` function, which combines elements from both tuples until the shorter of the two is exhausted, which aligns with the description stating that it should only process up to the length of the shorter tuple. The bitwise AND operation is performed on the corresponding elements, which is also what the problem description requires.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Tuples of Different Lengths**: The program is designed to handle tuples of different lengths correctly since `zip()` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple.
2. **Empty Tuples**: If either of the input tuples is empty, the output should be an empty tuple as no elements are available for the bitwise operation. This case is not explicitly mentioned but should be considered.
3. **Negative Numbers**: The bitwise AND operation should work correctly with negative numbers, but it's worth verifying that all combinations yield expected results.

### Testing Against Output Hints:
The output hints provided in the assertions match the expected behavior described in the problem statement:
- `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is correct.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))` results in `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is also correct.
- `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))` results in `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which is again correct.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the problem description, the program's implementation, output hints, and potential edge cases, the code appears to function as required. It handles tuples of varying lengths, performs the bitwise AND operation accurately, and behaves correctly with empty tuples.

Since I cannot identify a case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the function as required in all tested cases and adheres to the specifications given in the problem description.
