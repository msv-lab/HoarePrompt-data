The code snippet reverses the elements of `arr` from the start of the list up to and including the index `max_index`. The initial state indicates that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n - 1` elements. 

The elements in `arr` from index `0` to `max_index` are reversed, altering their order but not affecting the rest of the list or other variables. The values of other variables remain unchanged as there are no direct assignments or modifications to them.

Output State: **`arr` is the list with elements from index `0` to `max_index` reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n - 1` elements.**
