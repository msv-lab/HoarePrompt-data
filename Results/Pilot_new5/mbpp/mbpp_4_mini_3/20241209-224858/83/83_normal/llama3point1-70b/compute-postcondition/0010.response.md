The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of the index of the maximum element in the list `arr` from the start of the list up to the index `size` (which is `n - 1`). Therefore, `max_index` will hold the index of the maximum value within the first `n - 1` elements of `arr`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n - 1` elements.**
