The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` assigns the first `size` elements of the list `arr` with their reverse. Given that `size` is equal to `n`, and `max_index` is not equal to 0, this operation will reverse the elements from index 0 to `n-1` of `arr`. The previous values of the variable `arr` are now altered because the specified slice of `arr` has been reversed.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with the first `n` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
