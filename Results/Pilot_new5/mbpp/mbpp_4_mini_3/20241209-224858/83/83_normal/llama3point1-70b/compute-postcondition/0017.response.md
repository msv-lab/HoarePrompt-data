The code modifies a portion of the list `arr`. Specifically, it reverses the sublist from the start of `arr` to the index `max_index` (inclusive). The variable `size` has been decremented to `size - 1`, which may potentially affect the upper bound of the reversed sublist. The current value of `max_index` indicates the index of the maximum element in the list slice `arr[:size]`.

Therefore, the output state considers that `arr[:max_index + 1]` is now reversed, while `size` has been decremented, but the values of `arr`, `max_index`, and the new state after reversal must be captured.

Output State: **`arr` is the reversed sublist from the start to `max_index`, `size` is decremented to `size - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]**.
