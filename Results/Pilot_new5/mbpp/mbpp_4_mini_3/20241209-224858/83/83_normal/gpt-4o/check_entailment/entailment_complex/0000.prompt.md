You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements of any type in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `curr_size` is 1, and all elements have been flipped as necessary to achieve the sorted order.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' of elements of any type in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of elements of any type and returns the sorted list of elements in ascending order. It uses the flip operation based on the positions of the maximum elements to achieve the sorted order. However, it assumes that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined elsewhere, and their functionality is not verified here. Edge cases such as empty lists or single-element lists are not handled explicitly, but the function's behavior on such cases is to simply return the input since no sorting is needed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer representing the last index of the list to be flipped, and start is a non-negative integer that starts at 0, ensuring that start < end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end` (which is now the original index value divided by 2), `arr` is the reversed version of the list from index 0 to original value of `end`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` and reverses the elements of a global list `arr` from index `0` to `end`. It does not use a `start` parameter directly as an input; instead, it initializes `start` to `0` within the function. The function will not perform any action if `end` is `0` or if `end` is less than `0` since the while loop will not execute in such cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 1), then `max_index` remains 0.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum value in the list 'arr' from the elements 'arr[0]' to 'arr[n-1]', where 'n' is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of comparable elements, returning the index of the maximum value in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` is 1, the function does not enter the loop and will return 0, which may not reflect the actual maximum index when there's only one element. Furthermore, there is no handling for the case where the provided `n` is less than or equal to 0 or if `arr` is empty or not of length `n`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
