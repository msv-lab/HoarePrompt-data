#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements of any type in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `curr_size` is 1, and all elements have been flipped as necessary to achieve the sorted order.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' of elements of any type in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of elements of any type and returns the sorted list of elements in ascending order. It uses the flip operation based on the positions of the maximum elements to achieve the sorted order. However, it assumes that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined elsewhere, and their functionality is not verified here. Edge cases such as empty lists or single-element lists are not handled explicitly, but the function's behavior on such cases is to simply return the input since no sorting is needed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer representing the last index of the list to be flipped, and start is a non-negative integer that starts at 0, ensuring that start < end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end` (which is now the original index value divided by 2), `arr` is the reversed version of the list from index 0 to original value of `end`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` and reverses the elements of a global list `arr` from index `0` to `end`. It does not use a `start` parameter directly as an input; instead, it initializes `start` to `0` within the function. The function will not perform any action if `end` is `0` or if `end` is less than `0` since the while loop will not execute in such cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 1), then `max_index` remains 0.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum value in the list 'arr' from the elements 'arr[0]' to 'arr[n-1]', where 'n' is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of comparable elements, returning the index of the maximum value in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` is 1, the function does not enter the loop and will return 0, which may not reflect the actual maximum index when there's only one element. Furthermore, there is no handling for the case where the provided `n` is less than or equal to 0 or if `arr` is empty or not of length `n`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
