To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the provided problem description.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that sorts a list of elements.

### Functions and their output descriptions:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**: Intended to sort the list `arr` by using some form of flipping operation based on maximum elements.
2. **Function `flip(end)`**: Reverses elements of a global list from index `0` to `end`.
3. **Function `find_max_index(n)`**: Finds the index of the maximum value within the list.

### Initial Assessment of Code:
- The sorting logic in `func_1` uses a flipping mechanism, which is reminiscent of a pancake sorting algorithm. It appears that the function is trying to sort `arr` in ascending order, but it depends heavily on the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions' correct implementation.
- Notably, the `find_max_index` function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, which could lead to incorrect behavior (e.g., if an empty list or a list with one element is provided).
- The `flip` function operates on a global list `arr`, which is considered bad practice as it introduces side effects and reduces code maintainability. It also does not handle negative or zero values for `end`, which could lead to no action being performed when it should.

### Edge Cases Not Handled:
- **Empty List**: The program should ideally return an empty list if the input is empty.
- **Single Element List**: The program should return the same single element if the list contains only one element.
- **Negative Length**: If `find_max_index` is called with `n <= 0`, it could potentially lead to undefined behavior.
- **Global State in `flip`**: Using a global variable is not safe as it can lead to issues when multiple instances of sorting are invoked.

### Output Hints Review:
The output descriptions suggest that:
- The functions do not handle edge cases of empty or single-element lists explicitly but return the input directly (which is acceptable for single elements).
- The behavior of the `find_max_index` function is critiqued, specifically its lack of checks for valid input.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, especially concerning edge cases and the reliance on global state, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program must be deemed **False**.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with one element, and it relies on a global variable within the `flip` function, which is not good practice and can lead to errors.
