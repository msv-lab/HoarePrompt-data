The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Given that `i` is 1 and the condition specifies that the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`, it follows that `max_index` will now be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.**
