#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain a mix of integers and other data types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst' by summing 1 for each element 'x' that is an instance of int
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` that may contain a mix of integers and other data types, and it returns the count of elements in the list that are of type integer. It does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only non-integer typesâ€” in those cases, it will return 0 as the count of integers.
