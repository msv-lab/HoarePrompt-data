To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to consider whether the implementation of `func_1` accurately multiplies all the numbers in the input list (or tuple) and divides the result by the length of the list.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an iterable (list or tuple) as input, which is acceptable given the problem description.
2. **Multiplication Logic**: The function initializes a variable `product` with 1 and iterates over the numbers, multiplying each one to `product`. This part correctly computes the product of all elements.
3. **Division by Length**: After computing the product, the function divides it by the length of the input. This is also in line with the requirement.
4. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider possible edge cases:
   - **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will result in a division by zero error. The program currently does not handle this case and will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
   - **Single Element**: If there is only one element, the behavior seems correct, as it would return the element itself divided by 1.
   - **Negative Numbers**: The multiplication works correctly with negative numbers as shown in the provided assertions.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an empty list:
  ```python
  func_1([])  # This will raise ZeroDivisionError
  ```

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the empty list case, it will fail in that situation, which contradicts the requirement to "multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list." 

Therefore, based on this analysis, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
