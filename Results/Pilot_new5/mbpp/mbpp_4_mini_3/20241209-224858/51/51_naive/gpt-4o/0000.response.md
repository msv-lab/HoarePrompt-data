Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this scenario, the function will attempt to calculate the length of the list (which is zero) and will subsequently attempt to divide by zero when calculating the result. This will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, indicating that the function does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
