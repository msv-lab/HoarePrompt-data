The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list that contains integers or floats and is guaranteed to be not empty. The function calculates the product of all elements in the list and divides that product by the length of the list. If the list were to be empty, it would attempt to return a value resulting in division by zero, which is undefined. However, since the list is not empty, the function returns the average of the product based on the number of elements in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers or floats and return the average of the product of the list's elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats, and returns the average of the product of the elements in the list.**
