#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result' which is equal to the product of all elements in 'numbers' divided by the length of 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats and calculates the product of all elements in the list. It then returns the mean of these products by dividing the product by the length of the list. The function does not handle cases where the list may contain zero, which would make the product zero, potentially leading to a misleading result when the length of the list is considered.
