The variable `product` is initialized to 1. The variable `numbers` is a list of integers or floats and is not empty. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains as it was with the updated value of `product`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats and is not empty; `product` is 1**.
