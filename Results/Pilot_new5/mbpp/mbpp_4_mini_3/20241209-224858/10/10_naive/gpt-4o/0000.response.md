Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the volume, which is given by the area of the base triangle multiplied by the height (length) of the prism. The function `func_1` takes in three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the correct volume for the provided assertions. 

- For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the computed volume is `0.5 * 10 * 8 * 6`, which equals `240`. 
- For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the computed volume is `0.5 * 3 * 2 * 2`, which equals `6`. 
- For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the computed volume is `0.5 * 1 * 2 * 1`, which equals `1`.

Since all test cases return the expected results and the logic in the function aligns with the problem description, the implementation is correct.
