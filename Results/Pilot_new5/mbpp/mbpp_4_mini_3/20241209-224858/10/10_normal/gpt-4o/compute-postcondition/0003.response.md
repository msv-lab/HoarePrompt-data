The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive floats. The function calculates the volume of a triangular prism by first determining the area of the triangular base using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, and then multiplying that area by the `length` of the prism. The output is the volume, which is also a positive float, resulting from this calculation. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive float `base`, a positive float `height`, and a positive float `length`, and return the calculated volume of the triangular prism. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, all positive floats, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as `0.5 * base * height * length`.**
