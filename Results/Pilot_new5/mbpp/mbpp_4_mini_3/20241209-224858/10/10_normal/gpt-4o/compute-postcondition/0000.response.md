The variable `base_area` is assigned the value of `0.5 * base * height`. Given that `base` is a positive float representing the area of the triangular base and `height` is a positive float representing the height of the triangular prism, `base_area` will be a positive float as well. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `base` is a positive float, `height` is a positive float, and `base_area` is a positive value equal to `0.5 * base * height`.

Output State: **`base` is a positive float, `height` is a positive float, `base_area` is a positive value equal to `0.5 * base * height`.**
