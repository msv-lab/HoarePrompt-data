To assess the correctness of the program, let's first analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is typically given as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

The provided code implements this formula correctly by calculating the area of the triangle base (using \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \)) and then multiplying by the length \( l \).

**Initial Assessment:**
The code appears to correctly implement the formula for the volume of a triangular prism as described in the problem statement. 

However, we need to check for edge cases. The problem description does not specify that the parameters must be positive, but it is common to assume that dimensions of geometric shapes should be positive.

**Output hints:** The function accepts three positive float parameters: `b` (the base of the triangular prism), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (base `b` multiplied by height `h` divided by 2, multiplied by length `l`). There are no validation checks for non-positive values, which could lead to incorrect volume calculations if negative or zero values are passed.

The output hints indicate that while the function expects positive values, there are no checks in place to enforce this, meaning the function could produce nonsensical outputs if given non-positive numbers.

**Conclusion:**
Since the code does not handle cases where the parameters might be negative or zero (which would not make sense in the context of calculating volume), it does not fully comply with the problem description for all potential cases. 

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle negative or zero values, which could lead to incorrect volume calculations.
