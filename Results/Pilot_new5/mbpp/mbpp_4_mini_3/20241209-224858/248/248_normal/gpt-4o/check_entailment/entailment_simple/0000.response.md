Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1(lst)` which takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with various lists and confirm that the output is as expected—a tuple containing the same elements as the input list.

Here’s why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts an argument `lst`, which is explicitly stated to be a list. 
2. **Conversion Logic**: The core functionality is implemented using `return tuple(lst)`, which effectively converts the input list to a tuple.
3. **Validation through Assertions**: The assertions verify that the function returns the correct tuple representation of the list for the provided test cases.

Since the function accurately follows the problem description by converting any list it receives into a corresponding tuple, we can conclude that the program is correct.
