#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements of the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list. There are no additional checks for the type or contents of `lst`, so if `lst` is not a list or is empty, it will still return an empty tuple.
