Based on the problem description, the task is to convert a list to a tuple. The provided function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list.

Initially assessing the code:
- The code correctly uses the `tuple()` constructor to convert the list into a tuple. This fulfills the basic requirement of the problem description.

Next, considering edge cases:
- If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function will return an empty tuple `()`, which is appropriate and expected behavior.
- If the input is not a list (e.g., `None`, an integer, or a string), the `tuple()` call would not raise an error, and it would convert the input to an empty tuple because it would not iterate over `None` or other non-iterable types. This behavior may not align with the problem description, which implies it should accept only a list.

Now, examining the output hints, they state:
- The function accepts a list `lst` and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list.
- There are no additional checks for the type or contents of `lst`, so if `lst` is not a list or is empty, it will still return an empty tuple.

The output hints agree with the code regarding the conversion process but highlight that the function does not handle type checking. 

Therefore, since the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically, it does not enforce that `lst` must be a list), it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly when the input is not a list (e.g., `None` or an integer), as it will return an empty tuple instead of raising an error or handling it in a specified way.
