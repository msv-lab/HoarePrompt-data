Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that converts a list to a tuple. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an argument `input_list`, which is specified to be a list of elements of any data type. The program does not restrict the types of elements in the list, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The function utilizes the built-in `tuple()` constructor to convert the entire list into a tuple. This is the precise requirement stated in the problem description.

3. **Output**: The function returns the new tuple, which contains all elements from the input list. This means the output will always correctly represent the elements of the input list in tuple form.

4. **Generality**: The method works for lists containing various types of elements (e.g., integers, strings, floats, etc.), further supporting that it operates as intended across all possible cases described.

In conclusion, the function fulfills the requirements of the problem description by converting any list input into a tuple and returns it correctly.
