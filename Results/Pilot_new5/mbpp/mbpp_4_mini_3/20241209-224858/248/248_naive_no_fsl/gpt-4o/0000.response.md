Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` which converts a list to a tuple. The assertion tests provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for various cases, and there are no edge cases or alternative inputs that would cause the function to fail to meet the problem description. Since the conversion from a list to a tuple is straightforward and the function handles typical cases correctly, I can conclude that the program is correct.
