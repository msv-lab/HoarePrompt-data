According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning `n - 1` is at least 1. Since an IndexError occurred, it indicates that the loop attempted to access an index that is out of bounds. 

Since the loop's current index `i` should have been less than `n - 1`, after the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to `n - 1`. 

With `n` still being `greater than or equal to 2`, this means that `n` must now be at least 3 (to allow for `i` to be `n - 1`), and an access attempt would be made to the last valid index, which is `arr[n - 1]`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` remains positive infinity, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
