Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `min_diff` and `i` remain unchanged.***
