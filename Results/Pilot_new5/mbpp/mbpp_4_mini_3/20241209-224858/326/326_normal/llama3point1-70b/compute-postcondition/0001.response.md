The value of `min_diff` is assigned to positive infinity using `float('inf')`, which indicates that it has been initialized to a very large number. The other variables (`arr` and `target`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity**
