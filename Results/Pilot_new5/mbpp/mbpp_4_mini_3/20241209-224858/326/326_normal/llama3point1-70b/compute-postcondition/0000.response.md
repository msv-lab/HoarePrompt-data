The variable `arr` is assigned the value of its sorted form. The original order of the list of integers in `arr` is changed to be in non-decreasing order. The value of `target` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer**
