According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list. The loop will execute as long as there are at least 2 elements in the `arr` list (since `len(arr) - 1` must be at least 1). If `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the index of the last element in the range, which is `len(arr) - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0, and `target` and `min_diff` are left as they are for the purpose of this analysis.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
