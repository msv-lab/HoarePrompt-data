The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is calculated as `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
