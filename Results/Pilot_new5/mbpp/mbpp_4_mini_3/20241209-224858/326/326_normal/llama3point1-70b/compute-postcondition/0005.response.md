The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Given that `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])` and is currently less than `min_diff`, `min_diff` will now reflect the value of `diff`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.**
