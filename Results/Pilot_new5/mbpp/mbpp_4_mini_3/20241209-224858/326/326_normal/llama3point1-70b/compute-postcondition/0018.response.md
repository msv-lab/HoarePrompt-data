Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It computes and returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. The variable `target` is not used in the logic of the function and does not influence the output. Additionally, the function assumes that `arr` contains at least two elements; if `arr` has fewer than two elements, it may lead to an incorrect result or error since the difference calculation requires at least two values. **
