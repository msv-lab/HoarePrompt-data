Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input array has fewer than 2 elements. In such cases, it would not make sense to find a minimum difference, as there are not enough elements to compare. For example, if the input is an empty array `[]` or a single-element array `[5]`, the function will return `inf` as the minimum difference, which is incorrect behavior according to the problem description. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
