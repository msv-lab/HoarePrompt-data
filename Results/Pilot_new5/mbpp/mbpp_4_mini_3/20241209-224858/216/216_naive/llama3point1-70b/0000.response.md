To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The function begins by sorting the list, which is necessary for checking consecutive numbers.
  
2. **Checking for Consecutiveness**: It uses a generator expression to check if every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list has a difference of 1. 
   
3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The second part of the return statement checks whether all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set created from the list.

### Potential Cases:
- **Empty List**: An empty list should return `False`, as there are no numbers to be consecutive.
- **Single Element List**: A list with a single element (e.g., `[5]`) should also return `False`, as there are no pairs to check for consecutive numbers.
- **Non-consecutive Numbers**: A list like `[1, 2, 4]` should return `False`, indicating that the numbers are not consecutive.
- **Consecutive Numbers**: A list like `[3, 2, 4]` should return `True`, as the sorted version is `[2, 3, 4]`, which are consecutive.
- **Duplicate Consecutive Numbers**: A list like `[1, 1, 2]` should return `False`, as it contains duplicates.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List** `[]` → Should return `False`.
2. **Single Element List** `[5]` → Should return `False`.
3. **List with Gaps** `[1, 2, 4]` → Should return `False`.
4. **Consecutive Numbers** `[3, 2, 4]` → Should return `True`.
5. **List with Duplicates** `[1, 1, 2]` → Should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
The edge cases reveal a flaw in the implementation:
- The function will return `True` for an empty list and a single element list since `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` is `True`, and the `all()` check will not execute due to the range being empty.

Therefore, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
