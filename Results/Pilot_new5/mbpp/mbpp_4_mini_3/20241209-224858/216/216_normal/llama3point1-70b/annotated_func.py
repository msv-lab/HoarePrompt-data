#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive integers and all elements in 'lst' are unique, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the integers are consecutive (i.e., each integer differs from the next by 1) and all elements are unique. If either condition is not met (including cases where the list is empty or contains duplicates), it returns False.
