The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`. If the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted version of `lst` is not equal to 1, the function returns `False`. Additionally, there are other instances where the function might also return `False` based on unspecified conditions. Finally, if all elements in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and determine if the list contains all elements differing by exactly 1 while handling special cases such as empty lists or differences that do not meet the criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, and returns False if lst is empty, returns False if the elements do not differ by exactly 1, and returns True if all elements differ by exactly 1.**
