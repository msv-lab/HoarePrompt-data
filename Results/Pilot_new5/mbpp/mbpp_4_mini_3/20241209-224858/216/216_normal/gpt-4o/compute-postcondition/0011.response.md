According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop iterates from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `len(lst_sorted)` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning that the loop has executed for indices from 0 up to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. 

If the loop has completed its last iteration with `i` as `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Thus, `i` will be `len(lst_sorted) - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the loop condition is `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, which is always true as long as `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` becomes `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, and len(lst_sorted) is greater than or equal to 2, i is len(lst_sorted) - 1.**
