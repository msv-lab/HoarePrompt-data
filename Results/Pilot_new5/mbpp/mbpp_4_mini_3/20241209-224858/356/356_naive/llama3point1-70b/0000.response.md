Correctness: **False**.

The program only removes spaces (' ') from the input string, but it does not handle other whitespace characters such as tabs ('\t'), newlines ('\n'), or other forms of whitespace. For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the function will return `"HelloWorld\n"`, which still contains a newline character. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string.
