You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'
assert func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain whitespace characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string 's' with all whitespace characters removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string `s` with all whitespace characters removed. It effectively handles any string input, including empty strings, by returning it unchanged if it does not contain whitespace.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
