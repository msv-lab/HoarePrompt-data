Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. However, the function does not handle the case where the tuples are of different lengths. When tuples of different lengths are passed to the function, it will raise a `ValueError`, which is not part of the behavior described in the problem.

According to the problem description, there should be an expectation of either returning a result or handling the discrepancy without an error. As such, the function's failure to handle this case means it does not comply with the problem's requirements in all scenarios. 

Thus, the function's behavior when tuples of different lengths are provided is a case where it does not follow the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
