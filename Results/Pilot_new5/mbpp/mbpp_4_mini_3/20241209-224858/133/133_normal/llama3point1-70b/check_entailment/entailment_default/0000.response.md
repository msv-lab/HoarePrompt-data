The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and computes the element-wise difference between them, returning the result as a new tuple. However, the problem description specifies subtracting corresponding elements of the two tuples "with the same index", implying that both tuples should be of equal length. 

In the provided code, the use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` will create pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` until the shortest tuple is exhausted. This means that if `tup1` has elements and `tup2` is shorter, the extra elements in `tup1` will be ignored, which differs from the expectation set by the problem description that suggests the function should handle cases of unequal lengths differently, ideally raising an error.

Output hints clarify that if the tuples are of unequal length, the function will only compute the differences for the pairs that exist, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple without raising an error. This indicates that the function does not perform as expected when the lengths of the tuples do not match, which contradicts the problem description indicating there should be a subtraction for corresponding elements.

So, the output hints also confirm that the code does not handle the case of unequal tuple lengths properly according to the problem description. 

Thus, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
