The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of equal length containing numerical values. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of equal length containing numerical values and return a tuple representing the element-wise differences between these two tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples of equal length containing numerical values and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples.**
