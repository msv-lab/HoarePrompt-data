To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

### Provided Code:
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input.
2. It uses `zip` to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, allowing element-wise subtraction.
3. It correctly constructs a new tuple from the results of the subtraction.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **Different Length Tuples**: The function does not handle the case where `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths. In Python, `zip` will stop at the shortest input tuple, potentially leading to unexpected results. 
   - For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the result would be `(1-4, 2-5)` which equals `(-3, -3)`, ignoring the third element of `tup1`. The expected behavior for unequal lengths is not specified in the problem description.

2. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is correct but should be considered.

3. **Non-integer Elements**: The problem does not specify the types of elements within the tuples. If the tuples contain non-numeric types, the function would raise a `TypeError` during subtraction.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case of tuples of different lengths and can also lead to errors with non-integer elements. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
