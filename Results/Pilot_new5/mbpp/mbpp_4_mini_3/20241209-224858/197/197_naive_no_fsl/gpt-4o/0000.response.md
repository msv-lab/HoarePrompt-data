Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of specified elements from a list in a tuple. While the examples provided seem to work correctly, there is a potential edge case that the function does not handle properly. 

Consider the input where the `elements` list is empty:

```python
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), []) == 0
```

According to the problem description, if no elements are specified, the function should return 0 since there are no elements to count in the tuple. However, the function will return 0 due to the nature of the `sum()` function with an empty iterable, which is expected behavior. 

However, the function does not seem to handle the scenario where the input tuple is also empty:

```python
assert func_1((), ['a', 'b']) == 0
```

In this case, since the tuple is empty, there are no occurrences to count, and the function should return 0. 

Thus, the function works correctly for the provided assertions but does not explicitly handle edge cases for an empty `elements` list or an empty `tup`, which demonstrates that the program is not robust and does not fully meet the problem description requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
