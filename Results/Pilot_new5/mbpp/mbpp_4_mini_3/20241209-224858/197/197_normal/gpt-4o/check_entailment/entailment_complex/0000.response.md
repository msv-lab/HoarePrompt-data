Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality that matches the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. The purpose of the function is to count the occurrences of all elements from the `elements` list in the `tup` tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how the function meets the requirements:

1. **Tuple and List Inputs**: 
   - The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`elements`), which aligns with the problem requirement to count the occurrences of elements from a list in a tuple.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the `elements` list. For each element, it calls `tup.count(element)`, which accurately counts how many times that specific element appears in the tuple.

3. **Handling Non-existent Elements**: 
   - If an element from `elements` does not appear in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` returns 0 for that element, thus contributing zero to the total count. This behavior adheres to the requirement that only existing elements contribute to the count.

4. **Final Count**: 
   - The total count returned by the function is the sum of occurrences of all specified elements, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

The assertions provided further confirm the correctness of the implementation by testing various cases, including scenarios where elements occur multiple times, are absent, or are unique. Since the function accurately counts the occurrences as described, we conclude that the program meets the specifications of the problem description.
