Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elements`, which is a list of elements. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the occurrences of each element from the `elements` list in the `tup` tuple. Specifically, `tup.count(element)` counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`. This is exactly what the problem requires: to count the occurrences of all elements in the list found in the tuple.

3. **Correct Return Value**: The total count of occurrences is returned as an integer, which matches the output expected from the function based on the assertions provided.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that verify the correctness of the function. They check different scenarios, including:
   - A tuple of characters with some repeated values.
   - A tuple of integers with both repeated and unique values.
   - A tuple with distinct integers where only some are in the list.

Each assertion is expected to return the correct total count of occurrences, and they are all satisfied according to the implementation.

In conclusion, the function adheres to the problem description and correctly counts the occurrences of specified elements within a tuple. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
