Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. However, the program returns the total count of occurrences, which is a single integer value representing the sum of all counts. 

For example, if the list contains multiple elements, the program does not return a count for each individual element. Instead, it aggregates the counts into a single value, which does not fulfill the requirement of counting occurrences of each individual element in the list within the tuple.

A correct implementation would return a dictionary or a list of counts corresponding to each element in the list, showing how many times each individual element appears in the tuple. Therefore, the program fails to do what the problem description specifies.
