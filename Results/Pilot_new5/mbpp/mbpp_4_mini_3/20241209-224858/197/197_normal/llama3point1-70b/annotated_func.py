#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of how many times elements in the list 'lst' appear in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not appear in `tup`, it contributes zero to the count, ensuring that all elements are accounted for in the final total.
