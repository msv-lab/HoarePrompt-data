The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `lst`. `tup` is a tuple, and `lst` is a list of elements. After executing the function body, it returns the total count of how many times the elements in the list `lst` appear in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the count of occurrences of the elements in `lst` within `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of how many times elements in `lst` appear in `tup`.**
