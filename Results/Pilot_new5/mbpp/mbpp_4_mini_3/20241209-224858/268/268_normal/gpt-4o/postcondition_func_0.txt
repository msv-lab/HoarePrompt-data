The function accepts a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer n, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix. It assumes that all inner lists have the same number of elements, and that n is always a valid index based on the length of the inner lists. If the matrix is empty or if the specified column does not exist, it may lead to an index error, which is not handled in the function.
