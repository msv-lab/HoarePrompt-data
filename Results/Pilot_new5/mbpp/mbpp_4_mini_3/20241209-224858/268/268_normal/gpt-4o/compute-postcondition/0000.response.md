The code creates a new list `nth_column`, which is assigned the values from the nth column of each row in the `matrix`. The initial values of `matrix` and `n` are not specified, but the conditions state that `matrix` is a list of lists where each inner list has the same number of elements, and `n` is a valid index for the columns.

The `nth_column` will therefore contain the elements at index `n` from each inner list (row) of `matrix`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists (2D list) where each inner list has the same number of elements; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]); `nth_column` is a list containing the nth elements from each row of `matrix`.**
