The given Python program attempts to find the maximum value from the `n`th column of a matrix represented as a list of lists. The function takes in the matrix and a non-negative integer `n`.

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```
The code returns the maximum value from the `n-1` index of each row in the matrix. A critical issue arises here: if `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row, it could lead to an `IndexError` due to trying to access an invalid index.

Now, considering the problem description, it states that the function should return the maximum of the `n`th column in the matrix. However, it does not specify how to handle cases when `n` is out of bounds. The function assumes `n` is valid, which means there is an implicit assumption about input validity. This could lead to unexpected errors during execution.

Output hints state: "The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` of numbers and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, assuming `n` is valid and within the range of the matrix's columns. If `n` is out of bounds, it may raise an `IndexError`." This directly agrees with the code in that it confirms the code can raise an error if `n` is out of bounds.

Therefore, the code does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns, which is a potential edge case.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would lead to an `IndexError`. For instance, if `n = 0` or `n` is greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix, this will fail. Since the problem description does not specify that `n` is guaranteed to be valid, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases.
