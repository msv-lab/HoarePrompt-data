Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Indexing Issue**: The problem description specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer representing the column index, and it ranges from `0` to `len(matrix[0]) - 1`. However, in the code, the expression `row[n - 1]` is used to access the column. This leads to an off-by-one error because it reduces the index `n` by 1, which means that if `n` is `0`, it will try to access an index that doesn't exist, resulting in an `IndexError`.

2. **Error Handling**: While the function mentions that it may raise an `IndexError` if `n` is out of bounds, the problem description does not state how to handle cases when `n` is invalid. It is expected that the function should handle such cases gracefully rather than throwing an error.

Thus, the program fails to consistently meet the requirements outlined in the problem description due to the incorrect indexing and lack of error handling.
