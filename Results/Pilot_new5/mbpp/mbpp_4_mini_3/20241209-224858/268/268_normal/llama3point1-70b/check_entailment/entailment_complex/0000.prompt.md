You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists (2D list) of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the nth column (where n is a non-negative integer) of the 2D list 'matrix'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` of numbers and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, assuming `n` is valid and within the range of the matrix's columns. If `n` is out of bounds, it may raise an `IndexError`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
