To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider various potential input cases.

The function `func_1(matrix, n)` is intended to return the maximum value from the nth column of a given matrix. However, there are some edge cases and potential issues to analyze:

1. **Out of Bounds Column Index**: The function assumes that `n - 1` (to adjust for 0-based indexing in Python) is a valid index for every row in the matrix. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in the matrix, it will raise an `IndexError`.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the input `matrix` is empty, attempting to access any element will also raise an `IndexError`.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If the rows of the matrix have different lengths, accessing `row[n - 1]` may lead to `IndexError` for some rows.

Given these considerations, let's analyze the potential failure cases:

- **Case 1**: If `matrix` is empty, `func_1([], 1)` would raise an `IndexError`.
- **Case 2**: If `n` is out of bounds, such as `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)`, this would also raise an `IndexError`.
- **Case 3**: If the rows have inconsistent lengths, for example, `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 2)` would raise an `IndexError`.

Since the program fails to handle the above cases properly, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input matrix is empty, where `n` is out of bounds, or where rows of the matrix have inconsistent lengths.
