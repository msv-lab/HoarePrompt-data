To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description:

The problem asks for a function that returns the maximum value of the nth column from a given matrix represented as a list of lists.

Hereâ€™s the provided program:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)

assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11
```

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. **Index Out of Range**: The function does not handle cases where `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix or less than zero. This will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the rows of the matrix.
   
2. **Empty Matrix**: If an empty matrix is provided (i.e., `matrix = []`), attempting to access any column will lead to an error because there are no rows to access.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If the rows of the matrix are not of equal lengths, accessing the nth column for all rows might also lead to an `IndexError` if one of the rows has fewer columns than `n`.

4. **Negative Column Index**: If `n` is negative, accessing the nth column would not be defined in the context of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the outlined potential edge cases, the provided program does not handle all possible scenarios as required by the problem description. 

Therefore, based on these observations:

Correctness: **False**
