Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are expected to be positive floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * Ï€ * radius^2 * height. There are no checks for the validity of the input values, so if either parameter is negative or zero, the function will still execute but will yield a non-physical result (zero or negative volume). **
