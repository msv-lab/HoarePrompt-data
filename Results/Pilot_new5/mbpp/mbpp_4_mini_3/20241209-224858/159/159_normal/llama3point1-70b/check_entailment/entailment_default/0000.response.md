The code for the function `func_1` computes the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where `radius` and `height` are the parameters provided. The calculation itself appears to be mathematically correct for positive values of `radius` and `height`.

However, the problem description does not specify any constraints on the input values, and the code does not perform any checks to ensure that the `radius` and `height` are positive. According to the output hints, the function is expected to accept positive floating-point numbers, but if either `radius` or `height` is zero or negative, the function will still execute and produce a non-physical result (zero or negative volume).

The output hints indicate that the function lacks input validation and can yield incorrect results when invalid input is provided. For instance, if `radius` is zero or negative, the volume calculated will also be zero or negative, which is not valid in the context of a physical cone.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases because it does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or zero.

Correctness: **False**.
