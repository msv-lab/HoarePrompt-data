Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1(radius, height)` is intended to calculate the volume of a cone, which is correctly represented by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, there is an issue concerning the handling of possible invalid input cases.

One potential edge case is when the radius or height is negative. The volume of a cone cannot be negative, and the program does not account for this scenario. For instance:

- If we call `func_1(-5, 12)`, the output would be a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful.

Hence, due to the lack of input validation for negative values, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it is considered incorrect.
