To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The requirement is to write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. Specifically, if the input tuple is `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the output should be `(t_1 * t_2, t_2 * t_3, ..., t_N * t_{N+1})`, which means the output tuple should contain `N` elements.

### Program Implementation:
The provided implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))

```

### Analysis of the Implementation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple, which meets the input criteria.
2. **Tuple Length**: If the input tuple has a length of `N + 1`, the implementation uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its consecutive element. This effectively creates pairs `(t_1, t_2)`, `(t_2, t_3)`, ..., `(t_N, t_{N+1})`.
3. **Product Calculation**: The list comprehension calculates the product of each pair correctly, resulting in a tuple of length `N`.
4. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the edge case where the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements:
    - If the tuple is empty `()`, the function will return `()`, which is an empty tuple and is valid, as there are no elements to process.
    - If the tuple has one element `(t_1)`, the output will also be `()`, which is correct since there are no consecutive elements to multiply.
    
### Conclusion:
The implementation correctly handles the described functionality and edge cases. There are no cases where the code would return an incorrect result based on the problem description. 

Correctness: **True** 

The function successfully multiplies consecutive elements of the input tuple and handles edge cases appropriately by outputting an empty tuple when the input is too short.
