Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description.

**Problem description:** The function should take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()

def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a new tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in `t`, specifically calculating the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(t) - 2`. If `t` contains fewer than 2 elements, the behavior of the function is undefined, as it assumes the input will always meet this requirement.

**Initial assessment:**
1. The function `func_1` computes the products of adjacent elements in the tuple `t` using a tuple comprehension.
2. The tuple comprehension iterates from `0` to `len(t) - 2`, producing a tuple of length `N` where each element is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]`.

**Potential edge cases:**
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements. The output hints mention that the behavior is undefined in such a case, but the function returns an empty tuple for a single-element tuple.

**Output hints agreement:**
- The output hints correctly state that the function assumes the input will always have at least 2 elements. They also indicate that if the function is called with fewer than 2 elements, the behavior is undefined, which indeed makes the program potentially incorrect for such inputs.

Given this analysis:
- The function does not behave correctly for tuples with fewer than 2 elements, even though the output hints indicate that the function's behavior is undefined.

Correctness: **False**. The function does not handle cases where the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements, which is a requirement according to the problem description.
