Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a new tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in `t`, specifically calculating the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(t) - 2`. If `t` contains fewer than 2 elements, the behavior of the function is undefined, as it assumes the input will always meet this requirement. **
