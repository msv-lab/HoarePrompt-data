#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with length at least 2.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in the tuple 't', where each element is calculated as t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in the range from 0 to len(t) - 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a new tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in `t`, specifically calculating the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(t) - 2`. If `t` contains fewer than 2 elements, the behavior of the function is undefined, as it assumes the input will always meet this requirement.
