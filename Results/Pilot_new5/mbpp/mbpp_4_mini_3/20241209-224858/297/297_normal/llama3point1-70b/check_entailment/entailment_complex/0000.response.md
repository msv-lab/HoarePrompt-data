Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's the explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a tuple of integers with at least two elements. This aligns with the requirement of the problem description, which states that the input should be a tuple of numbers.

2. **Output Specification**: The function uses a generator expression combined with the `zip` function to pair each element of the tuple with its subsequent element (i.e., `t_i` with `t_{i+1}`) and computes their product. This is exactly what the problem description asks for: returning a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive pairs.

3. **Tuple Length**: The output is a new tuple of length `N` (where `N` is the original length of the input tuple minus one, since we're pairing each element with the next), which matches the requirement that the result is a tuple of length `N`.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The method of using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` effectively creates pairs of consecutive elements, and the product of these pairs is calculated correctly within the tuple comprehension.

5. **Assumption on Input Size**: While the function assumes that the input tuple will always have at least two elements, this is explicitly stated in the annotations. The function does not crash or produce incorrect behavior as a result of the input conditions outlined in the problem description.

Thus, since the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description and handles the expected valid input properly, it is correct.
