The given problem description states that the function should take a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and return a tuple of length N where the i-th element is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. The provided program appears to implement this logic correctly by using the `zip` function to create pairs of consecutive elements in the input tuple and multiplying them.

However, the output hints raise a concern about the function's handling of edge cases, specifically mentioning that it assumes there will always be at least two elements in the input tuple. If the input tuple has fewer than two elements (like an empty tuple or a tuple with only one element), the function could raise an error or not behave as expected, as it is designed to work with at least two elements.

Now, examining the output hints, they confirm that the function accepts a tuple of integers with at least two elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers. The hints also correctly point out that the function does not handle cases where the input has fewer than two elements. 

This means that while the function works as described for valid input (tuples with at least two elements), it does not cover all possible cases defined by the problem description, particularly for tuples with fewer than two elements.

Given this inconsistency between the program's capabilities and the problem description's requirements, it leads me to conclude that the program is indeed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.  

The function does not handle cases where the input tuple has fewer than two elements, potentially leading to an error. For example, calling `func_1(())` (an empty tuple) or `func_1((1,))` (a tuple with one element) would not behave as expected and could raise an error.
