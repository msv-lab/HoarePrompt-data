The provided Python function is designed to split a list into two parts based on a given integer `L`. Let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Code:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer `L`, splitting the list into two parts:
1. The first part of length `L` (which includes indices from `0` to `L-1`).
2. The second part should contain the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

### Initial Assessment:
1. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part will contain all elements, and the second part will be empty. This is correctly handled by the slicing used in the function.
2. If `L` is `0`, the first part will be empty, which is also handled correctly by the slicing.
3. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part will contain all elements and the second part will be empty as expected; however, this edge case needs to be explicitly tested, as slicing in Python will not raise an error, but may not conform to the intention of the function.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the behavior of the function concerning the list slices:
- It states that if `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, the function behaves as expected.
- It also describes the behavior when `L` is `0` or equal to the length of `lst`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `L` is negative**: The function does not explicitly handle negative values for `L`. In Python, `lst[:L]` will produce an empty list if `L` is negative, which is not mentioned in the problem description.
2. **When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`**: The function will return the entire list in the first part and an empty list for the second part. This may or may not align with the intended functionality (the problem does not explicitly state how to handle this).

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all edge cases correctly as stated in the problem description. Particularly, it does not specify behavior for negative values of `L` or when `L` exceeds the length of the list. 

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not cover all potential cases specified in the problem description. For instance, when `L` is negative, it returns an empty first list, which is not explicitly defined in the description.
