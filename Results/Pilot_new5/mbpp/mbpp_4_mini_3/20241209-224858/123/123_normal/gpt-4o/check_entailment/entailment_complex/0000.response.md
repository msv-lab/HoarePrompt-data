Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`.

2. **Slicing Logic**:
   - The first part of the return value, `lst[:L]`, correctly slices the list to include elements from the start up to, but not including, the index `L`. This means it includes `L` elements if `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`.
   - The second part of the return value, `lst[L:]`, correctly slices the list from index `L` to the end of the list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements of the list, and the second part will be empty, which is the expected behavior.
   - If `L` is 0, the first part will be an empty list, and the second part will contain all elements of `lst`, again matching the requirements.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions given in the code verify that the function behaves correctly for a variety of input cases, confirming that the expected output matches the actual output.

Therefore, since the function correctly splits the list according to the specified length `L` and handles edge cases appropriately, it follows the problem description accurately.
