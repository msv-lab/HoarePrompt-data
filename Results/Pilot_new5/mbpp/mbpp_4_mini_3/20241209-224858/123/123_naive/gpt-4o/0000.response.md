Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the integer \( L \) is greater than the length of the list. For example:

1. If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior would be to return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part. However, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `lst[L:]` because \( L \) exceeds the length of the list.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
