The provided program rounds every number in a list, calculates the sum of the rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```
The program seems to handle most cases correctly, including rounding the numbers, summing them, and multiplying by the list's length. However, it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list. If the list is empty, `total_sum` would be 0, and `len(numbers)` would also be 0, resulting in a return value of `0`, which is not necessarily incorrect but is an edge case that should be considered.

Now, checking the output hints:
The output hints state, "It does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but in such a case, it would return 0 due to multiplying the sum (which would be 0) by the length (also 0)." This aligns with the code logic and confirms that there is no explicit handling for an empty list.

Given that handling of the empty list is a valid concern in programming, and since the problem description implies that all cases should be considered, the lack of specific handling in the program means it may not be fully correct.

Correctness: **False**.

The case where the input list is empty leads to a return value of `0`, which doesn't align well with expectations when considering the problem description's intent of handling every potential case.
