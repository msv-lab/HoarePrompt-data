Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the issue arises when the input list `numbers` is empty. 

According to the problem description, the function must calculate the total sum of rounded numbers and multiply it by the length of the list. If the list is empty, both the sum of the rounded numbers and the length of the list would be zero, resulting in a return value of `0`. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, and it is reasonable to expect that a function designed to compute a sum and a product would return a meaningful result or raise an error in such cases. 

Since the function does not explicitly address the empty list scenario and simply returns `0`, it does not adhere to the expected behavior outlined in the problem description, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness. Therefore, the function cannot be considered correct for all potential inputs.
