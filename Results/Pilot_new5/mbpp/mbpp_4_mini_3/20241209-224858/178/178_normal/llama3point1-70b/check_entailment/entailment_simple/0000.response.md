Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is why it meets the specifications:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers`. This is done using the `round()` function, which adheres to the requirement of rounding every number.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: After rounding, the program computes the total sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function on the `rounded_numbers` list, which correctly reflects the requirement to find the sum of the rounded values.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program returns the product of the total sum and the length of the original list `numbers` by multiplying `total_sum` by `len(numbers)`. This follows the instruction to multiply the sum by the length of the input list.

The program does all of this in a clear and efficient manner, ensuring that all aspects of the problem description are adhered to for any valid list input. Therefore, it is correct based on the problem description provided.
