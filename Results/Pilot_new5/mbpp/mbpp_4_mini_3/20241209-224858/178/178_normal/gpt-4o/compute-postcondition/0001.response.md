The value of `total_sum` is assigned the result of summing all the values in `rounded_numbers`. The variable `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers obtained from rounding the numerical values in `numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers, and `total_sum` is the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`.**
