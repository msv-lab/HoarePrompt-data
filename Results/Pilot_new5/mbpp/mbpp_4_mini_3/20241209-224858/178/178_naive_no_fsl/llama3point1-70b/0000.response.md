Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list `numbers`, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list.

Here's why the program is correct in all potential cases:
1. **Rounding**: The `round(num)` function will round each number properly, according to standard rounding rules (i.e., rounding to the nearest integer and rounding .5 cases to the nearest even integer).
2. **Summation**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` correctly computes the total of the rounded integers.
3. **Multiplication by Length**: The multiplication by `len(numbers)` correctly scales the total sum based on the number of elements in the original list.

For any list of numbers, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list (which returns 0 since `len(numbers)` is 0).
- A list with negative numbers.
- A list with only one number.

All these cases will yield correct outputs as per the problem description. Thus, no counterexamples exist that would demonstrate the program's failure, confirming its correctness.
