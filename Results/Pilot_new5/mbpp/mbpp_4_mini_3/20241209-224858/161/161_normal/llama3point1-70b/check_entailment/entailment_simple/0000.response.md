To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of finding the nth Lucas number, let's first understand the sequence of Lucas numbers.

The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with different initial values:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, letâ€™s analyze the annotated program:

1. **Base Case for n = 0**: The program returns 2, which is correct as L(0) = 2.
2. **Base Case for n = 1**: The program returns 1, which is also correct as L(1) = 1.
3. **Recursive Case (n > 1)**: The program uses a loop to compute the nth Lucas number starting from known values L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1. It iterates from 2 to n, updating `a` and `b` where:
   - `a` keeps the (n-1)th Lucas number
   - `b` keeps the nth Lucas number
   - The formula `b = a + b` correctly follows the Lucas number recurrence relation.

In the end, the program returns `b`, which correctly represents the nth Lucas number.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the nth Lucas number as defined in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
