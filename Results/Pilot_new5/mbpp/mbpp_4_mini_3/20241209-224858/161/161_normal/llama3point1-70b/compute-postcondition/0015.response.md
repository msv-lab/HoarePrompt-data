The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the integer 2. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the nth term 'b' of the sequence where 'a' is the (n-1)th term. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the value of `n`: 2 for n=0, 1 for n=1, and the nth term of a sequence for n greater than 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns 2 if n is 0, returns 1 if n is 1, and for n greater than 1, it returns the nth term of a sequence defined by its previous terms.**
