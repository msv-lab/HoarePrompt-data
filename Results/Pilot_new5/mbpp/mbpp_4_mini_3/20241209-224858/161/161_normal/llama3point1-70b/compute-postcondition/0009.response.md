According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n + 1`, which means for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since the loop variable starts at 2, the next value for the loop variable will be 3. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` must now be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
