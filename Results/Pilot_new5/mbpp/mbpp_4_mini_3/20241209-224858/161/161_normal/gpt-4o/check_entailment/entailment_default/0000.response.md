To analyze the provided program and determine its correctness based on the problem description and output hints, let's first break down the key components.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n ≥ 2: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns different values based on its input: it returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the n-th Fibonacci number if `n` is 2 or greater.

### Initial Assessment:
1. When `n == 0`, the function correctly returns 2.
2. When `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1.
3. For `n ≥ 2`, the function initializes `a = 2` (L(0)) and `b = 1` (L(1)) and then iteratively computes the Lucas numbers using the recurrence relation defined (L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)).

### Checking for Edge Cases:
The program seems to handle the base cases correctly and uses an iterative approach for n ≥ 2. However, the output hints incorrectly state that for `n ≥ 2`, it returns the n-th Fibonacci number. This is misleading because the function is actually computing the n-th Lucas number, not the Fibonacci number.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints claim that the function returns the Fibonacci number for `n ≥ 2`, which contradicts the function's actual purpose of calculating the Lucas numbers. 

### Conclusion:
The program does not adhere to the requirement of calculating the n-th Lucas number correctly in all cases. Specifically, the output hints misrepresent the function’s behavior, and the code does not seem to account for the correct generation of Lucas numbers beyond the defined base cases.

Thus, due to the discrepancy between the problem description and the output hints, as well as the potential misunderstanding that arises from the hints, the logic must be deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function misinterprets the task of calculating Lucas numbers as calculating Fibonacci numbers for n ≥ 2, which is incorrect.
