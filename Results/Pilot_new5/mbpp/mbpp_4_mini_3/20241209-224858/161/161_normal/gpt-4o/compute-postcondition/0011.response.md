According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes with `_` starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 5, `_` is 4**
