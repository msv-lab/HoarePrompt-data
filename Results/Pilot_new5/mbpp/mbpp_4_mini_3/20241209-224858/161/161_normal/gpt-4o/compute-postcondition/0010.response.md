The values of `a` and `b` are updated according to the tuple assignment. Before the assignment, `a` is 3 and `b` is 2. After executing `a, b = b, a + b`, `a` will take the value of `b` (which is 2), and `b` will take the value of `a + b` (which is 3 + 2 = 5). The value of `n` remains unchanged as its value is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 2, `b` is 5, `_` is 3**
