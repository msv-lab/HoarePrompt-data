To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is intended to compute the nth Lucas number.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n â‰¥ 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

Now, let's examine the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Testing the provided assertions:
1. `assert func_1(9) == 76`:
   - The 9th Lucas number is correctly calculated as 76.
   
2. `assert func_1(4) == 7`:
   - The 4th Lucas number is correctly calculated as 7.

3. `assert func_1(3) == 4`:
   - The 3rd Lucas number is correctly calculated as 4.

### Potential edge cases:
- We need to check if the function handles negative inputs or non-integer inputs, as these scenarios are not covered by the current implementation. The Lucas number sequence is typically defined only for non-negative integers. Here's what happens with some edge cases:

1. **Negative Input**: 
   - `func_1(-1)` would not return a valid Lucas number, as the sequence is only defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Non-integer Input**:
   - `func_1(3.5)` would cause a TypeError when attempting to use it in the range function.

Since the function does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs correctly, it will fail in these cases. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is not completely correct according to the problem description, as it does not account for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False**
