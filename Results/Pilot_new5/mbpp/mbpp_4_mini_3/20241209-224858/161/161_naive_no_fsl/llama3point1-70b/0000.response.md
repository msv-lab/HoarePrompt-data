Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to calculate the n-th Lucas number, but it contains a flaw in how it generates the sequence. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

However, the program attempts to calculate the Lucas numbers but uses the Fibonacci number generation logic instead. Specifically, the line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` is incorrect for generating Lucas numbers; it should be accumulating the previous two Lucas numbers correctly.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider `n = 2`:

- The expected output for L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3
- However, running the program gives L(2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem description for this input case (and potentially others as well). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirement stated in the problem description.

Since the program fails for at least one potential input case, the correctness is deemed to be False.
