To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program and its expected functionality.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to compute the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

### Understanding the Program:
1. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The even numbers are generated using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
   - For `n = 1`, the output is `[2]`
   - For `n = 2`, the output is `[2, 4]`
   - For `n = 3`, the output is `[2, 4, 6]`
   - For `n = 4`, the output is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

2. It then computes the cube of each of these even numbers and sums them.

### Testing Against the Assertions:
- For `n = 2`: The even numbers are `[2, 4]`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`. The sum is `8 + 64 = 72`. (Correct)
- For `n = 3`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, and `6^3 = 216`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. (Correct)
- For `n = 4`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, `6^3 = 216`, and `8^3 = 512`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`. (Correct)

### Additional Cases:
We should also consider edge cases:
- For `n = 0`: The function should handle this case gracefully. The expected output is `0` because there are no even numbers to sum. However, the function does not explicitly handle `n = 0`, and it would result in an empty list, leading to `sum([])`, which returns `0`. This behavior is acceptable.
- For `n < 0`: The function should also handle negative `n` gracefully. The current implementation doesn't, so it will generate an empty list and return `0`, which may or may not be the intended behavior.

### Conclusion:
Since the program works correctly for typical positive values of `n` and handles edge cases of `n = 0` but does not account for negative values, which may lead to unintended behavior, we deem it incorrect.

Correctness: **False** (The function does not handle negative values properly).
