To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The function must compute the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Understanding Even Natural Numbers:**
The first `n` even natural numbers are: 
- For `n = 1`: [2]
- For `n = 2`: [2, 4]
- For `n = 3`: [2, 4, 6]
- For `n = 4`: [2, 4, 6, 8]

**Implementation Analysis:**
The provided function `func_1(n)` works as follows:
1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
   - This correctly generates the list of the first `n` even natural numbers since `2 * i` for `i` in `range(1, n + 1)` will yield the values [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n].
2. It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using the expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
3. Finally, it returns the computed sum.

**Checking Assertions:**
We can verify the assertions given:
- `func_1(2)` should return \( 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\) (Correct)
- `func_1(3)` should return \( 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\) (Correct)
- `func_1(4)` should return \( 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\) (Correct)

**Edge Case:**
- If `n = 0`, the function will return \(0\) correctly since there are no even numbers to consider, which aligns with the expected behavior.

**Conclusion:**
The function meets the requirements of the problem description, correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, and passes all assertions provided.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
