Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` only retains uppercase characters and removes all lowercase characters by filtering for `char.isupper()`. 

This means that if there are any lowercase substrings present, they are excluded, but the function does not explicitly address the concept of "removing lowercase substrings." For example, the string `PYTHon` correctly results in `PYTH`, but it is not clear how the program would handle a string that consists only of lowercase letters or if the lowercase letters are part of any mixed case words. 

For example, the input `abcde` would yield an empty string, which implies that the function is not performing the intended operation of removing lowercase substrings in a way that preserves the remaining structure of the string. The function logic could misinterpret the problem description as it focuses solely on character case rather than substring logic.

Therefore, the program fails to satisfy the problem's requirements comprehensively.
