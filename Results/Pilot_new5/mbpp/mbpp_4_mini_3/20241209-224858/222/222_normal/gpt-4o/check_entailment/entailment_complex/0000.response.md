Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implementation provided in the annotated program only extracts and returns uppercase characters, effectively filtering out lowercase characters but not removing or altering them as required by the problem description.

For example, given the string "PYTHon", the program correctly returns "PYTH", which aligns with the behavior of removing lowercase characters. However, the program fails to interpret "removing lowercase substrings" as it seems to imply that any contiguous segment of lowercase letters should be completely removed, while the implementation instead only retains uppercase characters and does not address the structure of the string.

Thus, while some cases may align with the expected output, the overall understanding of the requirement is not fulfilled, leading to inconsistencies in other scenarios that are not addressed. The program's output does not reflect the intent of removing substrings but simply filters characters. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the problem description.
