To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both.

**Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that removes all lowercase substrings from a given string. 

**Program Code**:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```

**Output Hints**: The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting only of the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, it returns an empty string.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The code iterates through each character in the string `s` and constructs a new string by including only the uppercase characters. This matches the intention of removing lowercase characters, as it returns a string made up entirely of uppercase characters.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string is empty, the output should also be an empty string, which the code handles correctly.
   - If the input string consists only of lowercase characters (e.g., `'hello'`), the output should be an empty string, which the code also handles.
   - If the input string consists only of uppercase characters (e.g., `'HELLO'`), the output should return the same string, which the code handles correctly.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function returns a new string consisting only of uppercase characters and correctly notes that if there are no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. This agrees with the code implementation.

### Conclusion:
After considering potential edge cases and verifying that the output hints align with the behavior of the code, we can determine that the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: True**. 

The program correctly identifies and removes all lowercase characters from the input string, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
