`result` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. Since `result` is initially an empty string and `char` is the first character in `s` (which is an uppercase character), `result` will now contain that uppercase character. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `result` is equal to `char`, `char` is the first character in `s` and is an uppercase character.**
