Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced with respect to the brackets '()', '{}', and '[]'. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. It uses a stack data structure, which is appropriate for tracking opening brackets.
2. The `for` loop iterates through each character in the expression, checking if it is an opening bracket. If it is, it is pushed onto the stack.
3. If a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. In either of these cases, it returns `False`.
4. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all opening brackets have been matched correctly, and the function returns `True`.
5. The program correctly handles various edge cases, including:
   - Expressions with no brackets (which should return `True`)
   - Nested brackets (which should return `True` for balanced expressions)
   - Unmatched opening or closing brackets (which should return `False`)
   - Different types of brackets mixed together (e.g., "({[]})" should return `True` while "({[})" should return `False`)

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description requirements, the program is correct.
