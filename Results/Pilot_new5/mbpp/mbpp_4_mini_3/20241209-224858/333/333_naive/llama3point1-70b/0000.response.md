Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks if the given expression has balanced brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets). It utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that they are properly closed in the correct order.

1. It iterates through each character in the expression.
2. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
3. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False` indicating the expression is not balanced.
4. Finally, it returns `True` only if the stack is empty, meaning all brackets were properly closed.

The implementation considers all possible cases for balanced brackets and works correctly for various combinations of brackets, including:
- Fully balanced expressions (e.g., `"{[()()]}"`)
- Unbalanced expressions (e.g., `"{[(])}"`)
- Expressions with no brackets (e.g., `"abc"`), which are also considered balanced.

Since I cannot find any input cases for which the program behaves incorrectly or fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
