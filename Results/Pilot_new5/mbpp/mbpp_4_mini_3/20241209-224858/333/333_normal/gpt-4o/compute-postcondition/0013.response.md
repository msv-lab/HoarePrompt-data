The code `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char` to the end of the list `stack`. The initial state specifies that `expr` is a non-empty string, indicating there are characters to process, `stack` corresponds to an expected state indicating it can hold additional characters, `char` is the next character from `expr`, and `index` represents the position of `char` in `expr`. 

Since `stack` is being modified by appending `char`, the output will reflect the updated `stack`. The values of `expr`, `char`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is updated to include `char`, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `index` is the position of `char` in `expr.**
