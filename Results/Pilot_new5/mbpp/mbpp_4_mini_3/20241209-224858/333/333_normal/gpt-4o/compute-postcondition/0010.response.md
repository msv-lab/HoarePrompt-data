Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list that contains the expected matching pair for `char`, `char` is the first character of `expr`, and `char` is not in the values of `matching_pairs`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, then the top element of `stack` matches the expected value from `matching_pairs[char]`.***
