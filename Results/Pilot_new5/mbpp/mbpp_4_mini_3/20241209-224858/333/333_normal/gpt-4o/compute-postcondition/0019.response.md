The code `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char` to the stack. The initial state indicates that `char` is the next character in the string `expr` at `index`, and `index` has been incremented by 1, which means `index` is now one position further in `expr`.

The variable `stack` is expected to hold a collection of characters. The state of `expr` and the incremented `index` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but the `stack` now includes `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr` at the current `index - 1`, `index` is incremented by 1, and `stack` now includes `char`.**
