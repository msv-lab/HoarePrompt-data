Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`, and `char` is not in the values of `matching_pairs`. The current value of `char` is in `matching_pairs`. Either the `stack` is still empty, or the character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding value in `matching_pairs` for `char`.***
