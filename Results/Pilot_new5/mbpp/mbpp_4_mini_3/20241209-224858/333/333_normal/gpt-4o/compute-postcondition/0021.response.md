Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr` at `index`, and `index` is incremented by 1. If `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the execution continues with no specific return value.***
