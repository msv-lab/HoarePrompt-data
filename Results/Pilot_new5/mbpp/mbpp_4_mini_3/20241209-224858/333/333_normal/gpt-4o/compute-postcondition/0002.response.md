According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. The loop will only execute if `expr` is a non-empty string, as it iterates over each character in the string. The current state shows that `stack` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution directly. However, we need to ensure that `char` has a valid initial value to start the iteration.

For the loop to execute, `expr` must be a non-empty string, and `char` should be set to the first character of `expr` during the first iteration.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`**
