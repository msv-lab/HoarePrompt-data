#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces, and is to be checked for balance.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces, `stack` is either empty (indicating that every opening bracket in `expression` had a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order) or it contains unmatched opening brackets (indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets in `expression`). The function would return False if there is any mismatch between opening and closing brackets during the evaluation of `expression`.
    return not stack
    #The program returns False if there are unmatched opening brackets in 'expression', indicating a mismatch; otherwise, it returns True, confirming that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` containing various types of brackets (parentheses, braces, and brackets) and checks whether they are balanced. It returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, and `False` if there are any mismatches or unmatched opening brackets. The function handles cases with mixed brackets and returns `False` for any imbalance.
