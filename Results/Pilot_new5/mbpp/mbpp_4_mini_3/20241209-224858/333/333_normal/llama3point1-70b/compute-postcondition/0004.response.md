The code `stack.append(char)` modifies the `stack` list by appending the current value of `char`, which is the first character of the non-empty string `expression`. The initial state specifies that `stack` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `stack` will contain one element, which is `char`. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `stack` is a list containing `char`**.
