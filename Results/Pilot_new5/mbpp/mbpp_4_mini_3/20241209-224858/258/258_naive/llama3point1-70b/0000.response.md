To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` which is intended to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power `n`.

Let's evaluate the program:

1. The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string (`num_len`) which gives the number of digits in the number.
3. It initializes `sum` to 0 and iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number, converting each back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulating this total in `sum`.
4. Finally, it compares the accumulated `sum` to the original number (`num`) and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating it is an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

Now, let's consider various cases:

- **Example Case 1:** For `num = 153`, which is an Armstrong number, the program will compute \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\). The output will be `True`, which is correct.

- **Example Case 2:** For `num = 9474`, which is also an Armstrong number, the program will compute \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474\). The output will be `True`, which is correct.

- **Example Case 3:** For `num = 10`, which is not an Armstrong number, the program will compute \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1\). The output will be `False`, which is correct.

- **Edge Case:** For `num = 0`, the computation will be \(0^1 = 0\). The output will be `True`, which is debatable as to whether 0 should be considered an Armstrong number based on some definitions, but it fits the formula.

Despite checking several cases, none reveal an error in how the program functions according to the definition of Armstrong numbers.

Since it accurately identifies Armstrong numbers for various inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
