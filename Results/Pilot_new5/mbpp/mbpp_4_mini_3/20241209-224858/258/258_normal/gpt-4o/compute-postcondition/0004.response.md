The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function checks whether the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` is equal to `n`, which determines if `n` is an Armstrong number. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return whether `n` is an Armstrong number based on the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns whether `n` is an Armstrong number.**
