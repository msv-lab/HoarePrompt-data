The variable `sum` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` (number of digits in `num`), and `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` (number of digits in `num`), `sum` is 0.**
