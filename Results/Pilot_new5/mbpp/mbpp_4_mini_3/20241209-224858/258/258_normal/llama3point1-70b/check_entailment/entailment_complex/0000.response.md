Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number, as required by the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits `n` is an integer such that the sum of its digits raised to the power `n` is equal to the number itself. For example, for the number 153, which has 3 digits, \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input.
   - It converts this number to its string representation to facilitate the processing of each digit.
   - It calculates the length of this string (`num_len`), which corresponds to the number of digits in `num`.
   - It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - It iterates over each digit in the string representation of `num`, converts each digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds this value to `sum`.
   - Finally, it checks if this accumulated `sum` is equal to the original number `num`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the calculated `sum` equals `num`, indicating that `num` is indeed an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Condition Checking**: The code accounts for non-negative integers, as specified in the annotations. Since the function logic adheres to the definition of an Armstrong number and correctly checks this condition, it satisfies the problem description fully.

Thus, the program correctly determines if a number is an Armstrong number, fulfilling all requirements specified in the problem description.
