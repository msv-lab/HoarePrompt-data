Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it splits the list into `n` sublists. The elements from the original list are distributed into these sublists in a round-robin fashion, which is exactly what the problem statement requires.

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by creating a list of empty sublists with `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`. This prepares `n` empty lists to hold the results as described.

2. **Distribution of elements**: The `for` loop iterates through each element of the input list `lst`, using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element itself. The expression `result[i % n].append(element)` effectively distributes the elements of `lst` into the `n` sublists in a round-robin manner by using the modulus operator. This ensures that every `n`-th element goes to the same sublist, fulfilling the requirement of splitting the list for every `n`-th position.

3. **Returning the result**: Finally, the function returns the `result`, which is a list of lists, each containing the elements from `lst` organized as specified.

4. **Edge cases**: The function is designed with the assumption that `n` is always less than or equal to the length of `lst`, as stated in the annotations. This assumption is confirmed by the assertions provided in the tests, which all have valid inputs based on this premise.

Given that the program correctly implements the requested functionality and handles the expected input cases, it is accurate to assert that the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
