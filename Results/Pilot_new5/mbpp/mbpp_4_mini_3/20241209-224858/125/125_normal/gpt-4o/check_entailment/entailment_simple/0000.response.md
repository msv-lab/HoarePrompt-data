Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Specification**: The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, where `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of `lst`.

2. **Output Specification**: The function is supposed to return a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to every nth element from the original list.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function initializes a list of empty lists `result` with `n` sublists, which will store the elements from `lst` distributed in a round-robin fashion.
   - It then iterates over the enumerated elements of `lst`. For each element, it calculates the index of the sublist to which this element should be appended using the modulo operation `i % n`. This effectively distributes the elements among the `n` sublists.
   - Finally, it returns the `result`, which contains the required split of the original list.

4. **Correctness Validation**:
   - The program has been validated against several assertions that match the expected output based on the described functionality. All assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected.
   - The round-robin distribution ensures that elements are evenly spread out across the sublists, correctly aligning with the problem's requirements.

Since the function meets all the criteria outlined in the problem description and passes the provided test cases, we conclude that the program is correct.
