Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It distributes the elements of `lst` into `n` sublists in a round-robin manner, and returns these sublists as a list of lists. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, it is assumed that the input is invalid, but the function does not handle this case explicitly, which may lead to unexpected behavior. **
