The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. After executing the function, it returns a variable named 'result', which contains 'n' sublists. These sublists are populated with elements from `lst` distributed in a round-robin manner. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, then return 'n' sublists created by distributing the elements of `lst` in a round-robin fashion. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n, then returns n sublists created by distributing the elements of lst in a round-robin manner.**
