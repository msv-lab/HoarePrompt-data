According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list `lst`. As long as `lst` is not empty, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, it ensures that there are at least `n` iterations possible. At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(lst) - 1`, and `element` will be the last element of the list.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `element` corresponds to the first element of `lst` during the first iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst), `result` is a list containing `n` empty sublists, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element of `lst`**
