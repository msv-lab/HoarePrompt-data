The code `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the value of `element` to the sublist in `result` at the index determined by `i % n`. Since `i` is 0, the expression `i % n` results in 0, meaning `element` will be appended to the first sublist of `result`. The other variables (`lst`, `n`, `result`, and `element`) retain their previous states without changes. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst), `result` now contains `n` sublists with the first sublist having `element` appended, `i` is 0, and `element` is the first element of `lst`.**
