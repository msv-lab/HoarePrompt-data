The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. After executing the function body, it returns a list where each sublist consists of elements from `lst` taken at intervals of `n`, effectively creating `n` separate groups based on the position of elements in the original list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of sublists, each containing elements from `lst` grouped by intervals of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n, returning a list of sublists where each sublist consists of elements from lst taken at intervals of n.**
