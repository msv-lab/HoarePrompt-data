The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` taken at every `n`th position starting from indices `0` to `n-1`. This effectively divides the original list into `n` groups based on the intervals of `n`. There are no error checks for when `n` is out of bounds or when `lst` is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
