According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. The loop iterates over the indices of `sorted_list`, so it will execute if the `sorted_list` has at least 1 integer. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will represent the current index in the `sorted_list`. 

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `sorted_list` must contain at least 1 integer.
2. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
