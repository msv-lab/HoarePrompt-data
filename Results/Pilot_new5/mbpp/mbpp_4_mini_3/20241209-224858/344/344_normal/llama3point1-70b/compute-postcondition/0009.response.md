Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order with at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[2]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns 2. If `sorted_list[2]` is less than `value`, the function does not return anything.***
