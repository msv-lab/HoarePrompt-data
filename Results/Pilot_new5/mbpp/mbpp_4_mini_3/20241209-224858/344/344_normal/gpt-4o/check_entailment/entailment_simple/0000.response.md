Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Problem Specification**: The task is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This means that given a sorted list and a value, we need to find the index where the value can be inserted without disrupting the order of the list.

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. 

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the code test the function with various inputs:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4`: The index returned is 4, which is correct because 6 would be inserted at the end of the list.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2`: The index returned is 2, which is correct as 3 would fit between 2 and 4.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4`: The index returned is 4, which is correct since 7 would also go at the end of the list.

All these assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected in locating the insertion point for the values provided in the sorted list. Therefore, the program correctly implements the asked functionality from the problem description.
