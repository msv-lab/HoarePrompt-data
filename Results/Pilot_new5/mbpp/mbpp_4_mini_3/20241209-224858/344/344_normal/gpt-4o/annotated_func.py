#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in 'sorted_list' where 'value' would fit if inserted while maintaining the sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value and returns the index where the value can be inserted into the sorted list while maintaining its sorted order. It uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the appropriate index, which means that if the value is equal to existing elements in the list, it will return the index to the right of the last occurrence of that value.
