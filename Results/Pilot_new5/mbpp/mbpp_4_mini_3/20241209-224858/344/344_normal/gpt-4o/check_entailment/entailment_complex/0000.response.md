Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the appropriate insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Use of `bisect_right`**: The function utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. This method returns the index where the specified value can be inserted in the sorted list while maintaining the order. If the value already exists in the list, `bisect_right` returns the index to the right of the last occurrence of that value. This behavior is explicitly what the problem description asks for, ensuring that the list remains sorted.

3. **Correct Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests for the function:
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4` correctly indicates that 6 should be placed at index 4.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2` shows that 3 should be inserted at index 2.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4` demonstrates that 7 should be placed at index 4.

All assertions are accurate, confirming that the function behaves as expected and adheres to the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct in fulfilling the requirements of the problem.
