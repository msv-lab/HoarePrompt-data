Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 1`, if the digits at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` form an undulating sequence (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing), then `undulating` remains True; otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, indicating that the undulating condition is not satisfied, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
