To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly checks if a number is undulating.

### Understanding "Undulating Number":
An undulating number alternates between higher and lower digits. For a number to be considered undulating:
- The digits must rise and fall alternately. 
- For example, `121`, `545`, and `232` are undulating, while `122`, `344`, and `123` are not.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it into a string for easier digit comparison.
2. The variable `undulating` is initialized to `True`. It will remain `True` if the undulating condition is met for all digits; otherwise, it will be set to `False`.
3. The loop iterates through each digit from the second to the second to last (`for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):`).
4. Inside the loop, it checks two conditions using:
   - `n[i - 1] < n[i] < n[i + 1]` (indicating an increase)
   - `n[i - 1] > n[i] > n[i + 1]` (indicating a decrease)
5. If neither condition is met, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks the loop.
6. The function returns `undulating`, which indicates whether the number is undulating.

### Correctness Assessment:
The program correctly captures the required behavior to identify undulating numbers. It properly checks each digit and ensures that no adjacent digits are the same and that they alternate accordingly.

However, there are a couple of issues:
- The program does not handle cases where `n` has fewer than 3 digits (e.g., `1`, `22`, etc.), which are technically not undulating according to the strict definition of having at least three digits to alternate.
- The check using comparison directly on string characters assumes that the digits are compared lexicographically, which can lead to incorrect results if not handled as integers (e.g., in cases with leading zeros).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description regarding undulating numbers due to its failure to handle edge cases appropriately (like numbers with fewer than three digits).

Correctness: **False**
