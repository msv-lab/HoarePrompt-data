According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is in the range from 1 to `len(n) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(n) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, which would be out of the range defined by `range(1, len(n) - 1)`. 

Since `i` is already at `len(n) - 1`, the loop cannot execute again. 

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 1`**
