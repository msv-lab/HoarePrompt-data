The function accepts a positive integer `n`, checks if its string representation has less than 3 digits and returns False if so. It then checks if the first two digits are the same and returns False if they are. If the string representation has 3 or more digits, the function verifies that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
