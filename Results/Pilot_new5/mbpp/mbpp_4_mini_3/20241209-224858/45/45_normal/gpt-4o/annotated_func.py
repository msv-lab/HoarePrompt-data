#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the conditions for returning True are not met, given that 'n' is a positive integer and the length of its string representation 's' is less than 3
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the value of first_digit is equal to the value of second_digit, indicating that they are not different.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the string character representing the first digit of `n`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`. The first digit of `n` is not equal to the second digit of `s`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with an even number of characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and each character at even indices of `s` (starting from index 2) is equal to `first_digit` and each character at odd indices of `s` (starting from index 3) is equal to `second_digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating the conditions based on the string representation of n and its digit pattern are satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, checks if its string representation has less than 3 digits and returns False if so. It then checks if the first two digits are the same and returns False if they are. If the string representation has 3 or more digits, the function verifies that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
