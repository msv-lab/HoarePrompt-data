The given function `func_1` attempts to retrieve the first element of each sublist from a list of non-empty lists. The problem description clearly states the function should return a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

Here is the function again:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and retrieves the first element (`sublist[0]`).
2. Since the problem description expects a list of non-empty lists, the function would work correctly for all the provided assertions. However, it does not handle the case where a sublist might be empty, which would result in an `IndexError`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
An important edge case to consider is when the input list contains an empty sublist, e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7]])`. In this case, trying to access the first element of the empty sublist would raise an `IndexError`.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints mention that the function assumes all sublists are non-empty and that if any sublist were empty, it would raise an `IndexError`. This aligns with the code's behavior. The output hints correctly identify that there's a potential failure when handling empty sublists.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly due to the lack of handling for empty sublists. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases where any of the sublists are empty, as it would raise an `IndexError`.
