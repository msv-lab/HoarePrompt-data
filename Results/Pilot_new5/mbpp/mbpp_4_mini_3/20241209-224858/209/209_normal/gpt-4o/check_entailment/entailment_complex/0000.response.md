Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirements stated in the problem description. While it is intended to return the first element of each sublist, it assumes that all sublists within the main list are non-empty. The annotations point out this assumption explicitly, stating that if any sublist were to be empty, an `IndexError` would be raised.

The problem description requires the function to get the first element of each sublist, but it does not specify that all sublists will be non-empty. Therefore, if a user provides a list of lists that includes even one empty sublist (e.g., `func_1([[1], [], [3]])`), the function will fail with an `IndexError`. This failure demonstrates that the function does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential inputs, making it incorrect. 

Thus, the program does not handle the edge case of empty sublists, which is a valid case under the problem description.
