Correctness: **False**

The program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly returns the first element of each sublist for non-empty sublists, it fails to handle the case of empty sublists. If any sublist is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element. The problem description implies that the function should reliably return the first element of each sublist, which cannot be guaranteed if there are empty sublists present. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement as stated in the problem description.
