The code provided aims to return the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists. Let's break down the requirements and the code:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is supposed to retrieve the first element of each sublist. 

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and extract the first element (`sublist[0]`).
   - If a sublist is empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.

3. **Output Hints**: The hints state that the function does not handle empty sublists, implying that an empty sublist will cause an error when the function tries to access its first element. 

Given this analysis:
- The function does not correctly handle the case where any sublist is empty. If an empty sublist is encountered, the function will raise an `IndexError`, which means it doesn't adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints confirm this issue, as they explicitly mention the potential for an `IndexError` when accessing the first element of an empty sublist.

Therefore, the function is incorrect because it fails to consider the case of empty sublists.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle the case where a sublist could be empty, leading to an error when attempting to access the first element of such a sublist.
