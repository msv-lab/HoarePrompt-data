To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and check if it correctly returns the first element of each sublist in a list of lists.

### Problem Description
The requirement is to return the first element of each sublist.

### Program Analysis
The code implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

### Evaluation of the Code
1. **Empty Sublists**: The program assumes that every sublist has at least one element. If an empty sublist (`[]`) is encountered, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.
   
   Example case:
   ```python
   func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]) 
   ```
   This will cause an error because the first sublist is empty.

2. **Empty Input List**: If the input list itself is empty (`[]`), the function will return an empty list, which is correct, but it's important to note that the function should handle this explicitly.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle the case where sublists might be empty and will raise an error in such situations, it does not fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
