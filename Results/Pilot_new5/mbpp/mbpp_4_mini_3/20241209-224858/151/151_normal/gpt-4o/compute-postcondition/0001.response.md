According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one item (which could be an integer or another list), the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop but will be populated during the loop iterations. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least one item, and `item` will be the first element of the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element of the `nested_list`**
