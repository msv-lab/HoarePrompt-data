Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a nested list structure. Here is why it meets the required criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The provided function `func_1` takes a list (`nested_list`) that may contain integers and other lists, including nested lists. The function iterates through each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item to flatten it. If the item is an integer, it appends it directly to the `flat_list`.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The recursive nature of the function ensures that any level of nesting is handled, meaning it can flatten lists that contain other lists, regardless of how deep they are nested.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the integers extracted from `nested_list` in a single, flat list. If `nested_list` is empty or contains only empty lists, it correctly returns an empty list, as specified in the annotations.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test the function against various nested lists and confirm that the output matches expected flattening results. These tests cover different scenarios, including:
   - A mix of integers and lists at different nesting levels.
   - Multiple nested lists within a single input.
   - Lists containing integers and other lists all being flattened into a single list.

Since the implementation matches the problem description and has been validated with test cases demonstrating correct behavior across various scenarios, the program is deemed correct.
