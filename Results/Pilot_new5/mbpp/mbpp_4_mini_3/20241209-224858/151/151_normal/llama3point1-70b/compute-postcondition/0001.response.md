According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. As `flat_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop but will be populated during the loop iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the last element iterated over.

To ensure that the loop will execute, `nested_list` must not be empty. Therefore, the adjusted states must ensure that `nested_list` contains at least one element, and `i` should be set to the first element of `nested_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
