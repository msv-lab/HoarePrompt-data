The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` takes the current value of `i`, which is the next element in `nested_list`, and applies the function `func_1` to it. The result of this function call is then added to `flat_list`. Since `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` will always refer to a valid element. The specific outcome of `flat_list` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but the overall structure of `flat_list` will be updated with the result of that function.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`flat_list` is updated based on the output of `func_1(i)`; `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in `nested_list`.**
