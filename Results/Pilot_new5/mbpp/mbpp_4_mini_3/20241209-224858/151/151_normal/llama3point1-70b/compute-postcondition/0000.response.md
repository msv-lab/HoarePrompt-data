The code initializes `flat_list` as an empty list. None of the elements in `nested_list` have been processed or changed; therefore, the state of `nested_list` remains the same. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
