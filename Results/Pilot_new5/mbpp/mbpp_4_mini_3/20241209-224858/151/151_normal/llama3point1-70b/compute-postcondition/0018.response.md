Functionality: ** The function accepts a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements from the nested structure. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function recursively processes any sublists found within the input list, ensuring that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nesting, are included in the output.**
