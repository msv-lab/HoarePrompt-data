Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively processes each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the results. If the item is not a list, it appends it directly to `flat_list`. 

The function handles the following cases correctly:
1. A list that contains integers and other lists, which it flattens into a single list.
2. Nested lists of arbitrary depth, as it uses recursion to ensure that all levels of nesting are flattened.
3. Mixed types, where integers and lists can be intermixed without issue.

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function produces the expected output for the sample cases given. Further testing with additional cases, such as:
- An empty list: `func_1([])`, which should return `[]`.
- A deeply nested list: `func_1([[[1], 2], [[3], [4, [5]]]])`, which should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

No cases can be found where the function fails given the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the function appears to be correctly implemented for the problem at hand.
