Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks if the length of the input array `arr` is not equal to the length of the set created from `arr`. The logic is flawed because the condition `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates, which is correct. However, if the input is `[1, 2, 2]`, the output will be `True`, indicating duplicates, which is also correct. 

However, the problem description does not specify what the function should return when duplicates are present. To be accurate, the function should return a Boolean indicating whether duplicates exist, not the count of duplicates or some other metric. Here, the return value is inverted.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description regarding output expectations.
