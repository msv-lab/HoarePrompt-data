Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks for duplicate elements in an array of integers. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(arr)` takes a single parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Logic for Duplicates**: The core logic of the function involves comparing the length of the input list `arr` with the length of a set created from `arr`. In Python, a set is a collection that automatically removes duplicates. Therefore, if there are any duplicate integers in the list, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original list.

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If the lengths are not equal (`len(arr) != len(set(arr))`), the function returns `True`, indicating that there are duplicates present in the array. 
   - If the lengths are equal, it returns `False`, indicating that all integers in the array are unique.

4. **Comprehensive Check**: This approach works for all potential cases, including:
   - An empty list (returns `False`, as no duplicates exist).
   - A list with a single element (returns `False`, as no duplicates exist).
   - A list with multiple elements, including duplicates (correctly identifies duplicates).

Thus, the program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description for identifying duplicate elements in an array of integers.
