Let's analyze the provided code and its description.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
```

### Initial Assessment
The function `func_1(arr)` checks whether the length of the input list `arr` is different from the length of the set created from `arr`. If they are different, it means there are duplicate elements, as a set only contains unique elements. Thus, the function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not.

#### Edge Cases Considerations:
1. **Empty list**: An empty list `[]` should return `False` since no duplicates are present.
2. **Single element list**: A list with a single element, e.g., `[1]`, should also return `False` since a single element cannot be a duplicate.
3. **All unique numbers**: A list with several unique numbers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, should return `False`.
4. **All duplicates**: A list with all identical elements, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`, should return `True`.
5. **Mixed duplicates**: A list with some duplicates, e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, should return `True`.

### Check against Output Hints
**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns False. It accurately determines the presence of duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list. No edge cases or missing functionalities are present in the provided code.

The output hints agree with the code. They accurately describe the functionality of the code, and from the findings above, we can see that the function handles multiple edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion
Since the function works correctly for the edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case (including empty lists and lists with one element), we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
