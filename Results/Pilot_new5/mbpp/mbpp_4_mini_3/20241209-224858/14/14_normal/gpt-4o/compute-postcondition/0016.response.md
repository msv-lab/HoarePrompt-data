The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function may return the following based on conditions:

- Case 1: Returns `True` if the first integer in `arr` has been seen (is in the 'seen' set).
- Case 2: Returns `True` under an additional unspecified condition.
- Case 3: Returns `True` if the third integer in `arr` has been seen and `arr` contains at least 3 elements.
- Case 4: Returns `False` if all integers in `arr` are unique and there are no duplicates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return `True` or `False` based on whether there are seen integers in the list and the presence of duplicates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns True if specific integers have been seen, or False if all integers in arr are unique.**
