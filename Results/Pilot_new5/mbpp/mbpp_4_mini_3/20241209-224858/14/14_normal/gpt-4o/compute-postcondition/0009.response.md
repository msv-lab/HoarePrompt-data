The code snippet `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. The initial conditions state that `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and `seen` contains `num` if it was already present before running the code. Regardless of whether `num` is already in `seen` or not, the operation will always ensure that `num` will be added to `seen`.

Thus, the state of `num` will remain unchanged, but the set `seen` will be updated to include `num`. The other variable states are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `seen` now includes `num`, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`.**
