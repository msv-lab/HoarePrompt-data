Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements as stated in the problem description. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input:** The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which aligns with the problem requirement of checking an array of integers for duplicates.

2. **Logic:** The function uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has encountered so far. As it iterates through each number in the input array:
   - It checks if the current number (`num`) is already in the `seen` set.
   - If it finds a duplicate (i.e., the number is already in the `seen` set), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate exists.
   - If the number is not in the set, it adds the number to the `seen` set and continues checking the next number.

3. **Return Value:** After checking all numbers, if it has not returned `True`, it concludes that there are no duplicates and returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases:** The provided assertions verify the correctness of the function:
   - For a list with unique numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `False`.
   - For a list with duplicates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, it correctly returns `True`.
   - For a list with multiple duplicates `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `True`.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios and fulfills the requirements of the problem description by accurately identifying the presence of duplicate integers in the input list, it can be confidently stated that the program meets the problem description.

Thus, the final determination is that the program is correct.
