Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates through all key-value pairs in the dictionary `d` and checks if each value `v` meets the condition `v >= n`. 

This implementation handles all potential cases, including:
1. An empty dictionary, which will simply return an empty dictionary.
2. A dictionary with all values less than `n`, which will also return an empty dictionary.
3. A dictionary with some values greater than or equal to `n`, which will correctly return only those entries.

Since I could not identify any case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
