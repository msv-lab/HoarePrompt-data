#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with integer values, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from 'd' where the values are greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys are arbitrary (but the values are integers) and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the corresponding values are greater than or equal to `n`. If all values are less than `n`, an empty dictionary is returned.
