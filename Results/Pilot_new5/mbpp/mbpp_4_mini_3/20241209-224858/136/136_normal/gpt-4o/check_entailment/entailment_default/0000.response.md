To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

**Problem Description**: The function should take in a dictionary and an integer `n`, filtering the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(d: dict, n: int) -> dict:
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}
```

**Output Hints**: The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys are arbitrary (but the values are integers) and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the corresponding values are greater than or equal to `n`. If all values are less than `n`, an empty dictionary is returned.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary based on the condition `v >= n`.
2. The description states that it should return an empty dictionary if all values are less than `n`, which the code does by simply returning a filtered dictionary that will be empty in such a case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case with an Empty Dictionary**: If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary. The code handles this correctly.
- **Case with All Values Below `n`**: As per the description, if all values in `d` are below `n`, the function should return an empty dictionary. The code handles this correctly as well.
- **Case with Negative Values for `n`**: If `n` is negative, all positive values should still be included in the result, which the code also correctly handles.
- **Case with n equal to one of the values**: The code should retain the entry where the value equals `n`, which it correctly does.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints summarize the function's behavior correctly:
- It confirms that the function filters entries based on the condition `v >= n`.
- It states that if all values are less than `n`, an empty dictionary is returned, which is consistent with the implementation.

After reviewing both the code and the output hints, I do not see any discrepancies or potential edge cases that are not handled. The function appears to adhere to the problem requirements.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly filters the dictionary as specified in the problem description and handles all potential edge cases appropriately.
