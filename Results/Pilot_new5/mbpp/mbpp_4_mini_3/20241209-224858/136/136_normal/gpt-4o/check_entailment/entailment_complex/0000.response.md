Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to filter a dictionary `d` based on a given integer `n`, returning a new dictionary containing only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function adheres to the problem description:

1. The function takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`.
2. It constructs a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension that iterates over each key-value pair in the original dictionary `d`.
3. The condition `if v >= n` ensures that only key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the resulting dictionary.
4. The function correctly handles the case where all values are less than `n`, returning an empty dictionary as specified.

The provided assertions verify the function's correctness with different inputs, confirming that it filters the dictionary as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the implementation is complete and accurate.
