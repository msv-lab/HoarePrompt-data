Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the entries of `d`, including only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The assertions provided serve as test cases that validate the correctness of the function:

1. The first assertion checks that when `n` is 170, the function returns a dictionary with values 175, 180, and 190, which are all greater than or equal to 170.
2. The second assertion verifies that with `n` set to 180, only the values 180 and 190 are included, which meets the requirement.
3. The third assertion confirms that when `n` is 190, only the value 190 is retained, as expected.

All cases confirm that the function behaves correctly and efficiently filters the dictionary based on the provided condition. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description.
