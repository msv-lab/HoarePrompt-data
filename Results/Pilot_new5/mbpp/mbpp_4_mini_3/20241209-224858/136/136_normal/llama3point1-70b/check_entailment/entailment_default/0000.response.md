The provided program aims to filter a dictionary based on integer values and retain only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. 

Looking at the code:

```python
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}
```

This program uses dictionary comprehension, which seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through all items in the dictionary `d` and constructs a new dictionary containing only entries that meet the condition `v >= n`.

Next, let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Dictionary**: If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the output should also be an empty dictionary, which the current implementation handles correctly.

2. **Negative Values**: The values could be negative, and the filtering logic should still work correctly since it checks against the integer `n` correctly.

3. **Type Handling**: The problem description specifies that all values are integers, which mitigates concerns about handling non-integer types.

4. **Values Exactly Equal to `n`**: The current logic includes entries where the value is exactly equal to `n`, which is consistent with the requirement.

Now, let's verify the output hints:

The output hints state that the function accepts a dictionary `d` where all values are integers and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. Furthermore, they assert that there are no edge cases or missing functionality in the code.

This aligns well with the functionality of the code, as it handles all the cases mentioned above appropriately. There doesn't seem to be any overlooked edge cases or discrepancies between the code and the output hints.

Since the code meets the problem description requirements for every potential case, I conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code effectively filters the input dictionary according to the specified condition, and it handles various cases such as empty dictionaries and negative values correctly. The output hints confirm that no edge cases are missed and that the code behaves as expected.
