Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as arguments. It correctly converts the tuple into a list and concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator. The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.

The function will also handle edge cases such as:
1. An empty list and a non-empty tuple: `func_1([], (1, 2))` will return `[1, 2]`.
2. A non-empty list and an empty tuple: `func_1([1, 2], ())` will return `[1, 2]`.
3. Both an empty list and an empty tuple: `func_1([], ())` will return `[]`.

Since no counterexamples can be found where the function fails to meet the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
