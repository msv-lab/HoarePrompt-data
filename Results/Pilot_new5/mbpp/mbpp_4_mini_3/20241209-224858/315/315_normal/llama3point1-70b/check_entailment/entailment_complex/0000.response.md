Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The function is intended to add the elements of a tuple to a list, but the way it is implemented returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and `input_tuple` converted to a list, which implies creating a new list rather than modifying the original list in place.

The problem description is ambiguous about whether the tuple should be added in place (modifying the original list) or if a new list can be created. However, the typical interpretation of "adding the given tuple to the given list" would imply modifying the `input_list` directly.

Since the function returns a new list rather than adding the elements to the existing `input_list`, it does not fulfill the task as expected. Therefore, the output does not align with the problem description's intent of modifying the list.

In summary, the program lacks the required behavior of adding the tuple's elements to the existing list directly, making it incorrect.
