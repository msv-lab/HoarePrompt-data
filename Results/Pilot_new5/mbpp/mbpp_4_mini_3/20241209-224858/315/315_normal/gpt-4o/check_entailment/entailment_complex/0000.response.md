Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it returns a new list that consists of the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted into a list.

Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Types**: The function is designed to accept a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`). The annotations confirm that these types are expected, and the implementation does not violate this assumption.

2. **Combining Elements**: The line `return lst + list(tpl)` effectively combines the list and the elements of the tuple. It converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to add the elements of the tuple to the list.

3. **Functionality Verification**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various scenarios to confirm that the function behaves as intended. Each assertion checks that the output is indeed a new list that contains all the elements from `lst` followed by all the elements from `tpl`.

4. **No Edge Cases**: The comments indicate that there are no edge cases regarding input types, as the function assumes proper input types. While the function will raise a `TypeError` for incorrect types, this is outside the scope of the problem description, which does not specify handling of such cases.

Overall, the function accurately implements the specified behavior of combining a list and a tuple, fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem description.
