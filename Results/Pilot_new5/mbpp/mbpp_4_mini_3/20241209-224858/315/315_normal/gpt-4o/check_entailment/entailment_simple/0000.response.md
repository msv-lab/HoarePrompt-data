Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as its parameters. It concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple converted into a list using the `list()` function. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases, and they verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Each assertion checks that the function returns the correct new list, which includes all elements from the original list followed by all elements from the tuple.

The function correctly handles the addition of the tuple to the list in every case presented, demonstrating that it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is correct.
