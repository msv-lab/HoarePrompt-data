Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that consists of the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl` converted into a list. There are no edge cases regarding input types, as the function assumes that `lst` is always a list and `tpl` is always a tuple. It will raise a TypeError if these assumptions are violated. **
