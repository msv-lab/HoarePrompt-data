The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. The parameter `lst` is a list, and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that is the combination of the original list `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list formed by combining these two inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that combines `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted into a list.**
