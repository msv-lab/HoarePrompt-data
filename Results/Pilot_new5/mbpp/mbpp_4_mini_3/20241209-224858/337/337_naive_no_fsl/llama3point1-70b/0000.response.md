To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem requires finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The provided function uses a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list and sums those elements that appear exactly once (i.e., `lst.count(i) == 1`).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the expected output should be `0` because there are no elements to sum.
2. **All Repeated Elements**: If all elements in the list are repeated, the sum should still be `0`.
3. **Mixed Elements**: The function should correctly identify and sum only the elements that are not repeated, while ignoring those that are repeated.

### Evaluating the Function:
- For an empty list `[]`, the function will return `0`, which is correct.
- For a list with all repeated elements, e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, the function will return `0`, which is also correct.
- For non-repeated elements, e.g., `[3, 1, 2, 3]`, the function should return the sum of `1 + 2 = 3`, which it does.

### Potential Issue:
While the function seems to work correctly for the cases evaluated, there is a performance concern due to the use of `lst.count(i)`, which has a time complexity of `O(n)` for each element `i`. This results in an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)` for the function, which is not optimal.

However, the requirement is to check correctness against the problem description, not efficiency. Since the function does correctly sum only non-repeated elements in all tested cases, we conclude that it adheres to the requirements stated.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the list for all potential cases inspected.
