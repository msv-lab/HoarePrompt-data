Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to compute the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. However, the implementation uses `set(lst)` which removes all duplicate elements from the list. As a result, it does not sum only the non-repeated elements, but rather sums all unique elements, which is not the same.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. However, the implementation will sum all unique elements, which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`. Thus, the output does not match the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements.

Another case is `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`. The non-repeated elements are `1`, `9`, `2`, and `45`, which sum to `57`, but the implementation will sum `1 + 2 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 45 = 71`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem description correctly.
