Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list by checking the count of each element using the `count` method. If an element appears only once in the list (i.e., `lst.count(i) == 1`), it is included in the sum.

This function handles all potential cases adequately:
- If the list contains only repeated elements, the sum will be `0`, which is correct.
- If the list is empty, the sum will also be `0`, which is also correct.
- The function works for lists of varying lengths and elements, including negative numbers and zeros.

Since I cannot identify any case where the function fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that it is correct.
