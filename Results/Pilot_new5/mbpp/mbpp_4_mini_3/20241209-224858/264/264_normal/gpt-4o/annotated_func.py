#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the value of degrees converted to radians, calculated as degrees * (math.pi / 180)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `degrees` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent value in radians, calculated as `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. There are no checks for input types, so if a non-numeric value is passed, it may result in a TypeError.
