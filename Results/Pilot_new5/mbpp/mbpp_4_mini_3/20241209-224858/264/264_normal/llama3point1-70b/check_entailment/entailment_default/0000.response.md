The provided code defines a function that converts degrees to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. The problem description requires the function to perform this conversion.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The formula used in the function is correct for converting degrees to radians.
2. The function takes a numeric input, which is expected based on the description.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs. For example, if a string or a list is passed instead of a numeric value, it will raise a TypeError.
2. The function does not check for edge cases like extreme values, such as `None`, `inf`, or `NaN`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in calculations.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints confirm that the function accepts a numeric value and returns the equivalent radians using the conversion formula. However, it also states that the function does not handle non-numeric input or provide error checking. This aligns with the assessment that the function may fail if given non-numeric types.

Given that the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case (specifically, it does not handle non-numeric input), we conclude that the function is not correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to handle non-numeric inputs, which means it does not work correctly for every case specified in the problem description.
