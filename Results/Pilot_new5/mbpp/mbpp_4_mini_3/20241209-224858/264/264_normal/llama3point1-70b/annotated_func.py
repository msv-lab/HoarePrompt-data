#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the value of deg multiplied by π (pi) divided by 180, which converts the angle from degrees to radians.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by converting it using the formula `deg * π / 180`. It does not handle non-numeric input or provide any error checking for invalid values, assuming `deg` will always be a numeric type.
