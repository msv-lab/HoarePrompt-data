Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This is the standard mathematical conversion, and the implementation correctly uses the `math.pi` constant for accuracy.

The function will work for all valid degree inputs including positive, negative, and zero degrees. For example:
- `func_1(0)` returns `0.0`, which is correct since 0 degrees is 0 radians.
- `func_1(180)` returns `math.pi`, which is correct since 180 degrees is π radians.
- `func_1(-90)` returns `-math.pi/2`, which is correct since -90 degrees is -π/2 radians.

Since the code handles all potential cases appropriately and adheres to the problem description, it is correct.
