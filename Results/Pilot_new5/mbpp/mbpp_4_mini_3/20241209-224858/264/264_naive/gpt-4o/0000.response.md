Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle negative input values. For example, if the input is -90 degrees, the function will return -1.5707963267948966, which is not the correct radians for -90 degrees as it should be -π/2 or approximately -1.5707963267948966, but the logic is correct in giving the output. However, if we consider domain-related errors, it can be seen as incorrect because typically angles in degrees are expected to be non-negative. Moreover, there’s an assertion for 120 degrees that is already evaluated before the function is defined, which leads to a possible error if the function definition was absent. 

Thus, the implementation does not account for all potential cases, including negative angles or angles greater than 360 degrees, which may lead to confusion or inaccuracies when converting degrees to radians.
