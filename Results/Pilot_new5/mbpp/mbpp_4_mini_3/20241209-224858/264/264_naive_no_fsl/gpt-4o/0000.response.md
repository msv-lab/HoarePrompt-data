Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(degrees)` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions provided confirm that it returns the expected results for the input values of 90, 60, and 120 degrees. 

This conversion is mathematically accurate for all inputs since it applies the correct formula universally. Degrees can be any real number (including negative values and zero), and the function will still produce valid results. 

For example:
- If we input 0 degrees, the output will be 0 radians, which is correct.
- For -90 degrees, the output will be -1.5707963267948966 radians, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential edge cases and works as expected for all degrees, the program is correct.
