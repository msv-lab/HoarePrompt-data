#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'nums', which contains numbers (integers or floats).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers (which can be integers or floats) and returns the minimum value from that list. If the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError since the min function cannot operate on an empty sequence.
