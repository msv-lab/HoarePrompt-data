Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an argument and uses the built-in `min()` function to return the smallest number in that list.

The assertions that precede the function definition demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is indeed the smallest number in this list.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is the smallest number in this list as well.

Since the function consistently returns the correct smallest number for various lists, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
