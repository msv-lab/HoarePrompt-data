Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, while the function `func_1` correctly returns the smallest number in a list of numbers when the list is not empty, it does not handle the case where the list is empty. In such a scenario, the `min` function will raise a `ValueError`. According to the problem description, the function should find the smallest number in a list, but it implicitly assumes the list will always contain at least one number. Therefore, the lack of handling for an empty list means the function does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
