To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and examine the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The expected output should be a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

### Program Analysis:
Here is the provided function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)

# Test cases
assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])
assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])
assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])
```

### Considerations:
1. The implementation iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`, checking the length of each list.
2. It updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever a longer list is found.
3. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and corresponding list.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (e.g., `[]`), the function will return `(0, [])` which does not provide a meaningful result based on the problem description. The expected behavior for this case is ambiguous in the description. There is no indication of what should happen if there are no lists to evaluate.
2. **Multiple Lists of Equal Maximum Length**: The implementation does not specify which list to return in the case of two or more lists being of the same maximum length. The current implementation returns the first one it encounters, which may not align with certain expectations.

### Conclusion:
Due to the ambiguity in behavior for an empty input and the handling of multiple maximum-length lists, we find that the function does not meet the problem requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as returning a meaningful result for an empty input or correctly managing ties in maximum lengths.
