The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns the maximum length of the inner lists along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a ValueError due to the call to `max()`, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, it does not account for the case where there are no sublists present, which may lead to an error.
