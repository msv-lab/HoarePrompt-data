The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list can contain any type of elements. After executing the function body, it returns two values: the maximum length of the inner lists in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist from a collection of sublists that have a length equal to this maximum length. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the maximum length of the inner lists along with the first sublist that matches this maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the maximum length of the inner lists and the first sublist that has this maximum length.**
