The value of `max_len` is assigned the maximum length of the inner lists found in `list_of_lists`. The previous values of the inner lists do not affect the calculation of the maximum length, but they determine its value. Therefore, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest inner list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of the inner lists in `list_of_lists`.**
