Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func_1` does not correctly meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the function does not handle cases where multiple sublists may have the same maximum length. 

For example:

1. If the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, all sublists have the same length of 2. However, the program will only return the last evaluated sublist, which in this case would be `[5, 6]`, while potentially ignoring other sublists that also meet the maximum length condition.

2. Additionally, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the program correctly returns `(0, [])`, which is acceptable, but it does not provide a mechanism to select among multiple longest sublists if they exist.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement of returning a list of the maximum length in cases where there are multiple candidates, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect as per the problem description.
