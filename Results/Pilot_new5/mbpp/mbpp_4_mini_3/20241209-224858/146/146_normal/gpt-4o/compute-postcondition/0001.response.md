The variable `max_list` is initialized as an empty list. The previous value of `max_len` remains unchanged at 0, and `list_of_lists` is still a list containing sublists of varying lengths. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list.**
