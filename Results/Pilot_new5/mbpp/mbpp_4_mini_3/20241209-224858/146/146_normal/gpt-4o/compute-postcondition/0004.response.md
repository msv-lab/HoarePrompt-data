The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`. Since we know that the current length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, the value of `max_len` will now be equal to the length of `lst`, which is greater than its previous value of 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list that contains at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, which is greater than 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and the current length of `lst` is greater than the previous value of `max_len`.**
