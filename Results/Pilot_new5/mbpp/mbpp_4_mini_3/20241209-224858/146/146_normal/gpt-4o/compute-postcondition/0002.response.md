To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to examine the state of the variable `list_of_lists`. The loop will iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

1. For the loop to execute at least once, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist. If it is empty, the loop will not run.
2. The current values of `max_len` and `max_list` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they may be updated during the loop's iterations.

Given that `max_len` is initialized to 0 and `max_list` is empty, these values do not impact the ability of the loop to run, but we do need to ensure that `list_of_lists` has at least one sublist to enter the loop.

So, we need to adjust the states as follows to ensure the loop executes:

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list that must contain at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list**
