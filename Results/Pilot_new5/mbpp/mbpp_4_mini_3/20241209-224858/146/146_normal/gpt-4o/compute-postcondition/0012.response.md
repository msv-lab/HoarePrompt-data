The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`, which is the third sublist of `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least 3 sublists, `lst` is guaranteed to exist. The value of `max_len` will be equal to the number of elements in `lst`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist, `max_len` is the length of `lst`.**
