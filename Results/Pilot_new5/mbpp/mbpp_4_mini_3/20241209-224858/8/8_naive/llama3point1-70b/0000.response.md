Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the character appears only once in the string. For example, if the input string is "a" and the character is "a", the expected output should be an empty string since both the first and last occurrence of "a" should be removed. However, the program will return "a" (the input string itself) because it checks for `first_occurrence == last_occurrence` and executes the `replace` method, which does not affect the string when it only appears once. 

Additionally, if the character does not exist in the string at all, the program correctly returns the original string. However, the handling of the specific case of a single occurrence is flawed, leading to an incorrect output. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
