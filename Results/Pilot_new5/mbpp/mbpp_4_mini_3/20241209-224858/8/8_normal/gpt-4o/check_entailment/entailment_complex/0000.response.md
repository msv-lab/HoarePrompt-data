The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the implementation does not adhere to this requirement accurately.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Single Occurrences**: The implementation states that if the character `ch` is not found or occurs only once, it returns the original string `s`. This is correct according to the problem description; however, the description is not fully satisfied when the function calls are considered.

2. **Incorrect Removal Logic**: The key issue is how the function removes occurrences of `ch`. The logic provided in the return statement concatenates parts of the string, but it does not actually remove the first and last occurrences of `ch`. Instead, it removes **all occurrences** of `ch`, except for the first and last. 

   For example, if the input is `func_1('lollipop', 'l')`, the expected output should be `op`, as the first 'l' (at index 0) and the last 'l' (at index 5) are removed. However, according to the current logic, it would not correctly handle this case.

3. **General Cases**: The function fails to handle situations properly where `ch` appears more than two times. The expected behavior is to remove just the first and last instances, but the implementation instead concatenates substrings that can lead to the removal of other instances of `ch`.

To summarize, the function does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases. The logic for removing the first and last occurrences is not implemented correctly, thus failing to meet the requirements set out by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
