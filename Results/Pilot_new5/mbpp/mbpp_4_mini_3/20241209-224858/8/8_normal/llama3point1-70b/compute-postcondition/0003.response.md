Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. The current values are such that `first_occurrence` is not -1 and `last_occurrence` is not -1. The current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, indicating that `char` occurs exactly once in `s`.***
