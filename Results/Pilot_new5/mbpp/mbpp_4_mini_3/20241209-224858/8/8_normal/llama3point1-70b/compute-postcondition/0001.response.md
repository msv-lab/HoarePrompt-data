In the provided code, `last_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(char)`, which returns the highest index in `s` where the substring `char` is found. If `char` is not found in `s`, it returns `-1`. 

The variable `last_occurrence` will be updated based on whether `char` exists within `s` and its position if it does. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `s` is a string,
- `char` is a single character,
- `first_occurrence` is either the index of `char` in `s` or `-1`,
- `last_occurrence` is either the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is either the index of `char` in `s` or `-1`, `last_occurrence` is either the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1`.**
