You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string 's' with the single occurrence of 'char' removed, resulting in a string where 'char' appears exactly once in 's'
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string formed by removing the character at `first_occurrence` and the character at `last_occurrence` from the string `s`, while keeping the rest of the string intact. The indices `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are different, ensuring that two characters are removed.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`. It returns a new string based on the occurrences of `char`: if `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it removes that occurrence; if `char` appears multiple times, it removes both the first and the last occurrences; if `char` does not exist in `s`, it returns the original string unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
