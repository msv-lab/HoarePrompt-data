The annotated program is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Let's examine the program step by step to determine its correctness relative to the provided problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The program uses `s.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Handling Occurrences**:
   - If both the first and last occurrences are found (i.e., they are not -1):
     - If the first occurrence index equals the last occurrence index (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it means `char` appears only once in the string. In this case, it replaces the single occurrence with an empty string using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This correctly removes the character.
     - If the first occurrence index is different from the last occurrence index, the program constructs a new string by concatenating:
       - The substring before the first occurrence
       - The substring after the first occurrence (which skips the character at `first_occurrence`)
       - The substring between the first and last occurrences
       - The substring after the last occurrence (which skips the character at `last_occurrence`)

3. **Return Original String**:
   - If either occurrence is not found (i.e., `char` is not in `s`), the function returns the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all scenarios outlined in the problem description. It successfully removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string. It also correctly identifies edge cases, such as when the character appears only once or not at all.

**Correctness: True**
