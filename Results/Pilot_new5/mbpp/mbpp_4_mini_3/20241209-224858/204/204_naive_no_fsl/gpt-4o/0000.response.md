Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not account for months that are out of the valid range (1 to 12). 

For example:
- If you call `func_1(0)`, which is an invalid month number, the function will return `False` since `0` is not in the set of months with 31 days, but the correct behavior would be to handle it as an error or invalid input.
- Similarly, if you call `func_1(13)`, the function will also return `False`, but `13` is not a valid month number.

Since the function does not handle invalid inputs correctly and does not meet the requirements described in the problem statement for all potential cases, the program is incorrect.
