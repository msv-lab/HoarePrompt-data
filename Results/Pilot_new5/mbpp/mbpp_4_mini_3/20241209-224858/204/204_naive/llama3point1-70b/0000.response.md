Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the given month number contains 31 days by using a predefined list of month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The use of the `in` operator effectively tests if the provided month number is within this list. 

Since the problem description only requires checking the 31-day months and the function accurately handles any valid month number (1 through 12), it does not produce incorrect results for any potential case within the specified range. Thus, the logic is sound and adheres to the requirements.
