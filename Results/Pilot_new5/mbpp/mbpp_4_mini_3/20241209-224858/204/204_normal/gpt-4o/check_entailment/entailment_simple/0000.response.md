Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the specified functionality in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Correct Identification of Months with 31 Days**: The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_31_days` that includes the month numbers which have 31 days: {1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), 12 (December)}. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks to check whether a given month contains 31 days.

2. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if the month number passed as an argument is included in the set of months with 31 days and `False` otherwise. This is exactly what the problem describes.

3. **Test Cases Validated**: The assertions provided in the program test various month numbers:
   - `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days).
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days).
   - `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June does not have 31 days).
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days).
   - `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days).
   - `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November does not have 31 days).
   
   All the test cases align with expected behavior based on the month numbers.

Overall, the program accurately follows the problem description by correctly identifying which months have 31 days and returning the appropriate boolean value.
