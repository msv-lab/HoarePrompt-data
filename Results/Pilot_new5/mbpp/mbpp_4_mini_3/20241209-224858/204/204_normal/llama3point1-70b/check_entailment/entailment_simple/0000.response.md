Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It does this by defining a list of month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, which correspond to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. The function returns `True` if the provided month number `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise.

Since the function is designed to handle the input correctly (where `n` is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive), it appropriately checks if `n` belongs to the set of months with 31 days, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
