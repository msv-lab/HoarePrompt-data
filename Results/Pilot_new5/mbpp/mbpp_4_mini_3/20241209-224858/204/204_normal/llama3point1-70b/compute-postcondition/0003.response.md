Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month number between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and returns True if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December); otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 12, which could lead to unexpected results if the input is invalid. **
