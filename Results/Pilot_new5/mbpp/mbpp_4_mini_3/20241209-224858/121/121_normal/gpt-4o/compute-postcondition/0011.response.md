`S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 7 and `S0` is 3, we calculate `S_next` as follows: `S_next = 2 * 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17`. The values of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
