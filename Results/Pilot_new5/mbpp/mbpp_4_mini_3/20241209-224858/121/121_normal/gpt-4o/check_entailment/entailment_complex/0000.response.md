The provided program is supposed to compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, upon reviewing the code and its logic, it is evident that the function `func_1` does not compute these prime numbers as required by the problem description.

### Explanation of Issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for Newman–Shanks–Williams Primes:**
   - The sequence defined by `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` is not the correct recurrence relation for generating the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.
   - The actual Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are derived from a specific sequence of prime numbers and not merely from this recurrence relation.

2. **Base Cases Misalignment:**
   - The program returns `1` for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, which is not correct since the first two Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are `2` and `3` (not `1`).

3. **Assertions Fail:**
   - The assertions provided in the code (`func_1(3) == 7`, `func_1(4) == 17`, `func_1(5) == 41`) suggest expected outputs that are not met by the logic of the function. If you run the function with these inputs, the outputs will not yield the expected prime numbers, thus confirming the logical errors in the function.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False** 

The function does not correctly calculate the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, thus failing to meet the problem requirements.
