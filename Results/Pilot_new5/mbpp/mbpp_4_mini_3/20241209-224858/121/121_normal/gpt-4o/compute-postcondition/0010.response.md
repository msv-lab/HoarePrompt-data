According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 2 up to and including `n` (since the range function is exclusive of its upper bound). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since the loop will continue while `i` is less than or equal to `n`). 

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
