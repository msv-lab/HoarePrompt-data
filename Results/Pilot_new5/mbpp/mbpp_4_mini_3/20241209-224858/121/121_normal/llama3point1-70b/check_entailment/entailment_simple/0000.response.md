Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

**Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Newman-Shanks-Williams Primes**: The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers, with 7 being the first in the sequence.

2. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime:
   - It correctly handles numbers less than 2 by returning `False`.
   - For numbers 2 and greater, it checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if any divisor is found, and `True` otherwise.
   - This implementation is correct and efficiently determines the primality of a number.

3. **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime:
   - It explicitly returns 7 if `n` is 1, which is correct since 7 is the first prime in this sequence.
   - It initializes a counter and starts checking numbers from 7 onwards.
   - It uses the `func_1` to check for primality and only considers primes that satisfy the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is accurate for identifying Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
   - It increments the count of found primes, and when the count matches `n`, it returns the current number, which will be the nth prime.

4. **Loop Behavior**: The while loop in `func_2` continues indefinitely until the nth prime is found, ensuring that it will not exit prematurely and will correctly yield the result based on the input `n`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem statement and will work for all non-negative integers `n`, returning the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as specified.
