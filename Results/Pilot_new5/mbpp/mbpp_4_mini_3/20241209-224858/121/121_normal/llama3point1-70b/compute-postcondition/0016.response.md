According to the provided code, the loop is a `while True` loop. This means that it will always execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states, as the loop can certainly proceed to the next iteration without modifications.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is increased to 2 while `num` is 8.**
