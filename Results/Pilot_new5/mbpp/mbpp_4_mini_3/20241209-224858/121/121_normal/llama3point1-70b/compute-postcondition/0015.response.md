The value of `num` is incremented by 1. If `num` was initially 7, after the operation it will be 8. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `count`, and `num` are retained, except for the change in `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is increased to 2 while `num` is now 8.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is increased to 2 while `num` is 8.**
