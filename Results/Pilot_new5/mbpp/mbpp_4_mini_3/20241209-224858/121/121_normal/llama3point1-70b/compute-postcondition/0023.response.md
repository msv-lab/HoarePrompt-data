Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute indefinitely without any conditions that would prevent it from running again. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the next iteration to proceed, as the loop will certainly execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is increased to 2, `num` is 9**
