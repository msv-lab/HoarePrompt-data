The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The function has multiple output cases based on the value of `n`. 

- Case 1: If `n` satisfies certain conditions, the function returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
- Case 2: The function returns the value of `num`, which is 7.
- Case 3: The function returns the value of `num`, which is 8.
- Case 4: The function returns the value of `num`, which is 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific values (7, 8, or 9) based on certain conditions related to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (a positive integer greater than 0) and returns either 7, 8, or 9 based on specific conditions associated with n.**
