Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; if `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is increased to 2 while `num` remains 7 and the result of `func_1(num)` is true. If `num` modulo 6 is not in [1, 5], the values of `n`, `count`, and `num` retain their initial states.***
