You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as `n` is a non-negative integer and its current value is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. If the loop has executed completely without returning, `n` is a prime number. `i` is equal to `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that 'n' is a prime number as the loop has executed completely without returning.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2 or if it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is prime, it returns True. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly related to input types (e.g., negative integers or non-integer types), but it assumes `n` is a non-negative integer as stated in the precondition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1. The nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is to be determined but not calculated.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is the first number greater than or equal to 7 where `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `count` is equal to `n`; if `n` was initially greater than 1, then `count` is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n = 1`, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to find subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams primes by checking if numbers greater than or equal to 7 are primes and have a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. The function will continue until it finds the nth prime, returning that value. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input might not be a positive integer greater than 0, which could lead to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
