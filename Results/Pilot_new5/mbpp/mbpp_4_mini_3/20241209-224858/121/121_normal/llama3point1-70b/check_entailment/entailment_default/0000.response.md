To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the components step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Function Analysis

**Function 1: `func_1(n)`**
```python
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
- It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and correctly identifies prime numbers for values of `n` greater than or equal to 2.
- **Edge Cases**: It does not handle input types other than non-negative integers (e.g., if `n` is negative, a float, or a string). However, since the problem states that `n` is a non-negative integer, we will consider this acceptable.

**Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
```
- The function aims to return the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime by starting the search from `7`.
- It correctly returns `7` for `n = 1`.
- For other values of `n`, it counts primes that are congruent to `1` or `5` mod `6`.
- **Edge Cases**: Similar to `func_1`, it does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer (e.g., `n = 0`, negative integers). This could lead to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

### Output Hints Analysis
**Function 1 Output Hint**: Confirmed to agree with the function's logic. It correctly summarizes that the function checks for prime status.

**Function 2 Output Hint**: Also agrees with the function's logic and notes that the function searches for primes greater than or equal to `7` and checks the condition of being `1` or `5` mod `6`.

### Conclusion
Although the code structure and logic for determining the nth Newman–Shanks-Williams prime seem sound, there are critical edge cases that are not handled. Specifically, `func_2` does not address scenarios where `n` is less than `1`, which would result in an infinite loop as the while condition never breaks.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to address the situation where `n` is less than `1`, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect behavior.
