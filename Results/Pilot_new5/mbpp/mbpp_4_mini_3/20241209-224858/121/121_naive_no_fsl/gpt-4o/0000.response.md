To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to understand the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

The provided code seems to calculate values based on a specific recurrence relation, which is typical for generating certain sequences. The function `func_1` starts with certain base cases and iteratively computes subsequent values. However, the code does not seem to handle the prime-checking aspect, which is crucial since we are looking for prime numbers.

Upon analyzing the code:
1. The function correctly computes a sequence based on the recurrence relation for the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers.
2. However, it does not filter out only the prime numbers from this sequence. The output values of `func_1` alone are not guaranteed to be prime numbers, and the problem specifically asks for prime numbers.

To illustrate this issue with a concrete example:
- For `n = 2`, `func_1` will return 3, which is indeed a prime.
- For `n = 3`, it returns 7, which is also a prime.
- For `n = 4`, it returns 17, a prime as well.
- But if we keep calculating the sequence, we could end up with a non-prime number without proper checks.

Thus, the function fails to meet the requirement of returning the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number because it does not ensure that the output is a prime.

Given these observations, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the output value is a prime number, as required by the problem description.
