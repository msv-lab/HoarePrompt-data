Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Instead, it computes a series based on a recurrence relation, but it does not generate prime numbers. 

For instance, according to the problem description, the expected output for `func_1(3)` should be the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, which is 7, and `func_1(4)` should give 17. However, the function does not verify whether the generated sequence corresponds to prime numbers, leading to incorrect results for larger values of `n` that are not accounted for in the assertions.

Additionally, the function does not handle inputs that are less than 0 or non-integer values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
