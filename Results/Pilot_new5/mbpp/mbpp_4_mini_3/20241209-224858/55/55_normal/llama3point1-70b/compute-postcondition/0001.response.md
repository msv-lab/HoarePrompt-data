In the provided code snippet, `camel_case_str` is being assigned the value obtained by joining the words in `words` with each word capitalized. The variable `words` is derived from `snake_case_str` by splitting it at underscores.

1. **Impact on `camel_case_str`:** It will be updated to a new string formed by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them without spaces or underscores. 
2. **Impact on `words`:** The value of `words` remains unchanged as it was derived from splitting `snake_case_str` and is not mutated in any way during this operation.
3. **Impact on `snake_case_str`:** It remains unchanged in value.

Since `words` is a list of words obtained from `snake_case_str` and `camel_case_str` is a new string formed from those words (without any specific known content), we can state the results more generally.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string that consists of lowercase letters, underscores, and may contain multiple words separated by underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained from `snake_case_str` split by underscores; `camel_case_str` is a string formed by joining the capitalized words in `words`.**
