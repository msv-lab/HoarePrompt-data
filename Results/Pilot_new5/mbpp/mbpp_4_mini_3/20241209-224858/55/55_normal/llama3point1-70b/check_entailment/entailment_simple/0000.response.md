Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a snake_case string to a camelCase string as specified in the problem description. Here's how it works and why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string in snake_case format (lowercase letters separated by underscores).

2. **Splitting the String**: The line `words = snake_case_str.split('_')` splits the input string by underscores, resulting in a list of words. For example, the input `"this_is_a_test"` would result in the list `["this", "is", "a", "test"]`.

3. **Capitalizing Each Word**: The program uses a generator expression `word.capitalize() for word in words` to capitalize the first letter of each word in the list. For the previous example, it would convert `["this", "is", "a", "test"]` to `["This", "Is", "A", "Test"]`.

4. **Joining the Words**: The `''.join(...)` method concatenates the capitalized words into a single string without any separators. Thus, `["This", "Is", "A", "Test"]` becomes `"ThisIsATest"`.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the correctly formatted camelCase string.

The program accounts for all edge cases such as:
- An empty string will return an empty string.
- Multiple consecutive underscores will result in empty words in the list, but this will simply be ignored in the final result as those will not add any capital letters.

Overall, the program accurately transforms snake_case strings into camelCase format, adhering to the problem description's requirements.
