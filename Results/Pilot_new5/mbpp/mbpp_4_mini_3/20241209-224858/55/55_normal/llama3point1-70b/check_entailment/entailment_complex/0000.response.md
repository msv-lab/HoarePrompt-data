Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string as required by the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_case_str` that consists of lowercase letters and underscores, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Splitting the String**: The line `words = snake_case_str.split('_')` effectively splits the input string at each underscore, creating a list of words. This is the appropriate method to separate the components of a snake case string.

3. **Capitalization**: The expression `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` capitalizes the first letter of each word in the list `words`. This step is crucial for converting to camel case, where each word should start with an uppercase letter.

4. **Joining Words**: The `join` method combines these capitalized words into a single string without any underscores, which is exactly how camel case is structured.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the newly formed string, `camel_case_str`, which is consistent with the requirements of the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case of an empty string correctly by returning an empty string, as splitting an empty string results in an empty list, and joining an empty list also results in an empty string.

Overall, the function adheres to all specified requirements, and there are no scenarios where it would fail to produce the correct camel case output from the given snake case input.
