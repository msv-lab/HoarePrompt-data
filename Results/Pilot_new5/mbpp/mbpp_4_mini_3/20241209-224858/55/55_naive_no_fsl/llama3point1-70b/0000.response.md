Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle edge cases that can occur with snake case strings. For example, consider the input string `snake_case_str = "a_b_c"`. The program will return `ABC`, which is correct in camel case. However, it does not account for the case where the input is an empty string `""`, which should yield another empty string as output. The output for an empty string is not specified in the problem description, but it is a valid edge case that the function should handle. Additionally, if the input contains leading or trailing underscores like `"_abc"` or `"abc_"`, the output will be incorrect as it would produce `Abc` and `Abc`, respectively, rather than maintaining the expected format of camel case.

Thus, the program fails to correctly convert snake case strings to camel case for these potential edge cases.
