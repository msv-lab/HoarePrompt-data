Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element, and it correctly returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The provided assertions test various cases, and they all pass:

1. In the first assertion, the element `31` is found at index `3` in the array, and the output is `(True, 3)`.
2. In the second assertion, the element `61` is found at index `7` in the array, and the output is `(True, 7)`.
3. In the third assertion, the element `48` is found at index `6` in the array, and the output is `(True, 6)`.

Moreover, the function handles the case when the element is not in the array by returning `(False, -1)` as specified.

I could not identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
