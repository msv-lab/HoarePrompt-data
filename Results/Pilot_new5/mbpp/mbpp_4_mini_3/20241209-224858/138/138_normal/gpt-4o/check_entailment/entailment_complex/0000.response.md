Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which can be of any type that is comparable with the elements in `arr`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Element Search**: The function uses a `for` loop combined with `enumerate` to iterate over the elements of the list `arr`, checking each value against `element`.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If the `element` is found in the `arr`, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the `element`.
   - If the `element` is not found after checking all elements, it correctly returns `False` and `-1`.

4. **Handling an Empty List**: If `arr` is empty, the function will not enter the loop and will directly return `False` and `-1`, which is also the expected behavior as stated in the problem description.

5. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code successfully validate the expected behavior of the function for different cases (including when the element is present and when it is not). 

Overall, the function correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, ensuring that it returns the correct boolean indicator of presence and the appropriate index or `-1` for absence, thus confirming its correctness.
