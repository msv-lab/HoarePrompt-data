Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and a comparable `element`. It returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1. If `arr` is empty, it will return `False` and -1 as well. The function does not raise any exceptions for incorrect input types but assumes that the `element` is comparable to the elements in `arr`. **
