Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if an element is in the array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating presence and the corresponding index. It uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the array, which provides both the index and the value. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

The provided assertions test various scenarios, and they confirm that the function behaves as expected. I can't think of a case where it would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the logic implemented.
