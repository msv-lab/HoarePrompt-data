Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value of any type.

The key part of the implementation is the use of the `all` function combined with a generator expression. The expression `item == element for item in lst` iterates over each item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to the provided `element`. The `all` function returns `True` only if all evaluations of `item == element` yield `True`. If any item in the list does not equal `element`, `all` will return `False`.

This implementation satisfies the problem description in that it checks whether every item in the list is equal to the given element and reliably returns a corresponding boolean value. 

Thus, since the program fulfills the requirement to verify equality for all elements in the list against the specified element, it is correct.
