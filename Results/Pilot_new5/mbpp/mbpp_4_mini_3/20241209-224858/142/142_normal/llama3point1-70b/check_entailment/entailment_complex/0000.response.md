Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two inputs: a list `lst` and an `element`. This matches the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The use of `all(item == element for item in lst)` effectively checks each item in the list against the specified element. The `all()` function will return `True` only if every comparison evaluates to `True`. If at least one item does not equal the element, `all()` will return `False`.

3. **Empty List Case**: The function correctly handles the case of an empty list. In Python, `all()` returns `True` when called with an empty iterable, which aligns with the expectation that all zero items can be considered equal to the element.

4. **Return Values**: The return statement will yield `True` if all items are equal to the element or if the list is empty, and `False` if any item does not match the element. This behavior adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description.

In conclusion, the implementation is correct and adheres to the problem's specifications for all possible inputs, including the edge case of an empty list.
