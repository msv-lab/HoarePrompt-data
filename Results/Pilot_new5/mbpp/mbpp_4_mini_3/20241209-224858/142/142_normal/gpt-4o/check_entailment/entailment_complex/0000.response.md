Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(lst, element)` takes a list `lst` and an `element`. This matches the requirement of the problem description.

2. **Logic**: The function iterates through each `item` in the list `lst`:
   - If it finds an item that is not equal to `element`, it immediately returns `False`. This means that if any item in the list is different from the specified `element`, the function will correctly identify that not all items are equal to `element` and will return `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any item that differs from `element`, it returns `True`. 

3. **Empty List Handling**: The program also correctly handles an empty list. According to the problem description, if the list `lst` is empty, there are no items that contradict the condition of being equal to `element`. In such a case, the function returns `True`, which aligns perfectly with the requirements.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotations test various cases:
   - The first assertion checks that a list with different colors does not satisfy the condition, which correctly returns `False`.
   - The second assertion checks a list of integers against a number that is not in the list, which also correctly returns `False`.
   - The third assertion checks if a list where all items are the same as the `element` returns `True`, which it does.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, and all potential cases have been accounted for. Thus, the function is correct and meets the problem's expectations.
