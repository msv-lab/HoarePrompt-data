The provided program is supposed to check if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. 

The function iterates through the list and returns `False` if it encounters any item that is not equal to the given element. If all items are equal to the element, it returns `True`. The function also implicitly handles the case of an empty list by returning `True`, since there are no elements that contradict the condition.

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True
```
This logic seems to align correctly with the problem description, as it returns `False` if any item differs from `element`, and `True` if all items are equal.

Now, looking at the output hints: "If `lst` is empty, the function returns `True` since there are no elements that contradict the condition." This statement aligns with the behavior of the function.

However, there is an edge case that is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description or the output hints: if `lst` is `None`. The function does not handle the case where `lst` is `None` or some other non-list type, which could lead to a runtime error when trying to iterate over it.

Considering this edge case, the code does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case (specifically when `lst` is `None` or not a list).

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to consider the situation where the input `lst` is `None`, which would lead to a TypeError when trying to iterate over it. This demonstrates that the function does not adhere to the problem description for all cases.
