#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value of the same type as the items in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements containing only elements equal to `element`, and `item` is equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute and `item` is undefined.
    return True
    #The program returns True since all elements in 'lst' are equal to 'element' and 'item' is equal to 'element'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`. If any element is not equal, it returns `False`. If `lst` is empty, the function returns `True` since there are no elements that contradict the condition. Therefore, the function effectively checks for uniformity in `lst` regarding `element`.
