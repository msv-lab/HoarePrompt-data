The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number formed by `real + imag * 1j`, which is calculated using the `cmath.phase` function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, representing a complex number, and return the phase of that complex number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters real and imag, which are floating-point numbers, and returns the phase of the complex number represented by real + imag * 1j.**
