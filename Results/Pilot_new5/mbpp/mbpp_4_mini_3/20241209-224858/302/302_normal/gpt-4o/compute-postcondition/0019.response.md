The variable `high` is updated to the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` will be reduced to be one less than the middle index between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `high`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is now `mid - 1`.**
