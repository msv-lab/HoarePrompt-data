The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`, which means `mid` was previously computed based on the values of `low` and `high`. Therefore, after the assignment, `high` will now be one less than the previous value of `mid`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is equal to `mid`; `high` is now `mid - 1`.**
