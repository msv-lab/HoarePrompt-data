The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `result` is equal to `mid`, this indicates that `result` is also affected by the value of `mid`. The other variables `arr`, `low`, `result`, and the condition stating that `arr` must not be empty remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is equal to `mid`; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
