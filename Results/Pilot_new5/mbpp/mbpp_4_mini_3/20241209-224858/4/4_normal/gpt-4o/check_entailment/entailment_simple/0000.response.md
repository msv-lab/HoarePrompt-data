Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` checks whether two integers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved using the XOR operation (`a ^ b`), which outputs a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different. If two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the result of the XOR operation will be a power of 2 (which has exactly one bit set).

The function then checks two conditions:
1. It verifies that the `xor_result` is not zero (which would indicate that the numbers are not equal).
2. It checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 by evaluating `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. This condition is true if and only if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`.

The assertions provided cover various cases and confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- For `func_1(13, 9)`, the output is `True` because they differ at one bit position (1101 vs 1001).
- For `func_1(15, 8)`, the output is `False` because they differ at multiple bit positions.
- For `func_1(2, 4)`, the output is `False` because they differ at multiple bit positions.
- For `func_1(2, 3)`, the output is `True` as they differ at one bit position (10 vs 11).
- For `func_1(5, 1)` and `func_1(1, 5)`, both return `True` since they also differ at one bit position.

Thus, the function follows the problem description correctly, ensuring that it determines if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.
