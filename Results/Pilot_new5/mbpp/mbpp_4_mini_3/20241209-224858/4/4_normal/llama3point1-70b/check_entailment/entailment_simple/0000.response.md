Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that checks whether two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2`, differ by exactly one bit position in their binary representation.

Hereâ€™s how the implementation meets the problem description:

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The result of this operation has bits set to `1` wherever the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.

2. **Counting Set Bits**: The `bin()` function converts the resulting number from the XOR operation into its binary string representation. The `count('1')` method counts the number of `1`s in this binary string, which directly corresponds to the number of differing bit positions between `num1` and `num2`.

3. **Comparison**: The function then checks if the count of differing bits is exactly `1`. If so, it returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the program effectively checks for the condition specified in the problem description, it operates correctly for all non-negative integer inputs. Thus, it always does what the problem description requires.
