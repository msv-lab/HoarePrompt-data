Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description requirements in all cases. While the function correctly identifies the second smallest unique number from the list, it has a significant flaw: it returns `None` when there are not at least two distinct elements.

According to the problem description, it should find the "second smallest number," which implies that the input list must always contain at least two distinct numbers. However, the function currently returns `None` when it encounters a list with all identical elements where there are no second smallest values.

For example, the test case `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None` is problematic because the problem description does not specify that the function should return `None` if there are not at least two distinct elements. Instead, the expectation is that the function should either raise an error (indicating inappropriate input since it does not meet the problem requirements) or handle this case differently.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases according to the requirements outlined in the problem description.
