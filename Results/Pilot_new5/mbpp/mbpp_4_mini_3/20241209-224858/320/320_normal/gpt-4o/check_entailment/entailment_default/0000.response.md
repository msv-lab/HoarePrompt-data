Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description.

**Problem description:** The function should find the second smallest number in a list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two distinct elements and returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`. If there are not at least two distinct integers, it returns None.

### Initial Assessment
1. The function first creates a set from the input list to filter out duplicate values, ensuring that all numbers are unique.
2. It then sorts these unique numbers.
3. It checks if there are at least two unique numbers:
   - If yes, it returns the second smallest number (at index 1).
   - If not, it returns None.

### Edge Cases
- If the input list contains only one unique number (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the function should correctly return `None`, which the code handles.
- If the input list contains two identical numbers (e.g., `[1, 1]`), the function should return `None`, which is also handled correctly.
- If the input list has two distinct numbers (e.g., `[-1, 0]`), it should return `0`.

### Examining Output Hints
- The output hints describe that the function returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`.
- They also clarify that if there are not at least two distinct integers, it returns None. 

### Conclusion
After analyzing both the code and the description, I found that the program handles the cases as expected:

1. **From the assertions**:
   - For `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])`, it correctly returns `-2`.
   - For `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])`, it correctly returns `-0.5`.
   - For `func_1([2, 2])`, it correctly returns `None`.
   - For `func_1([2, 2, 2])`, it correctly returns `None`.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and handles edge cases properly, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
