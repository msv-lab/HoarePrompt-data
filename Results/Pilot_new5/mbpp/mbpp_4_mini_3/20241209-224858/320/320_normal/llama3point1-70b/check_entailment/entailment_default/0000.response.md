To determine the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the function, its logic, and potential edge cases.

### Problem description:
The task requires finding the second smallest number in a list.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Logic of the Code**:
   - The function first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, creating `unique_nums`.
   - It then checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`.
   - If there are at least two unique numbers, the function sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second smallest.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list `nums` contains fewer than two distinct integers (e.g., all elements are the same or there is only one element), the function correctly returns `None`.
   - If there are exactly two distinct integers, it will return the second smallest correctly.
   - If there are multiple distinct integers, it will also return the second smallest correctly due to sorting.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The hints mention that the function returns the second smallest unique integer if there are at least two distinct integers; otherwise, it returns `None`. They also note that this behavior may not be relevant based on the input guarantee that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements.

### Conclusion:
- The output hints agree with the code logic and the problem description.
- However, the hints suggest that the function's behavior of returning `None` may not be relevant if the precondition is indeed guaranteed to have at least two distinct elements.
- While the function logically handles cases of fewer than two distinct integers by returning `None`, the problem description implies that it is assumed there are at least two distinct integers in normal use.

Given that the function can technically return `None` even if the description states that there should be at least two distinct integers (which may not be relevant), this raises a question about adherence to the strict problem description for all potential cases.

**Correctness: **False**.**
- The function does not handle cases where it is supposed to return a valid second smallest integer due to a potentially incorrect assumption about input guarantees. It is not guaranteed that it will always receive valid input as described, and thus, returning `None` in such cases indicates a possible flaw in its design.
