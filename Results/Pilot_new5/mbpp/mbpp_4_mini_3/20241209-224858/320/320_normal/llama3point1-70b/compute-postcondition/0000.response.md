The code creates a set from `nums`, which removes duplicates, and then converts that set back into a list, assigning it to `unique_nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will contain only the unique integers from `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
