The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. If the unique integers derived from `nums` do not have at least two elements, the function returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, the function returns the second smallest unique integer from that set. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either None if there are not enough unique integers or the second smallest unique integer if there are. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns None if there are not at least two distinct integers. If there are at least two distinct integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`.**
