Output State: **The program returns None, indicating that there is no value to return despite 'nums' being a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. This suggests that 'unique_nums', which contains unique integers derived from 'nums', has a length that is not sufficient to meet the condition of having at least two unique integers.**
