To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds even numbers from a list of numbers.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from that list. Additionally, it mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-integer elements. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Initial Assessment:
The function implementation uses a list comprehension that filters the input list `numbers`, returning only those numbers for which the condition `num % 2 == 0` holds true (i.e., the number is even). 

- If the input list contains only integers, the function appears to work as expected.
- If the input list is empty, the output will indeed be an empty list.
- However, the function does not validate whether the input is a list or if all elements in the list are integers, which is a significant oversight.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Input Type Handling**: If the input is not a list (e.g., a string, dictionary, or None), the function will raise an error, rather than handling it gracefully.
2. **Non-Integer Elements**: If the list contains non-integer elements (e.g., strings or floats), these elements will not be filtered out, which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
3. **Input List with Non-Integer Types**: For example, `func_1([1, '2', 3])` would not produce the intended result and could lead to a TypeError.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints correctly describe the function's intended behavior regarding the selection of even integers from a list. However, they also correctly point out the lack of type handling, confirming that the code is not fully compliant with the problem specification, as the problem description implies that the function should accept only lists of integers.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle all edge cases as described in the output hints. Specifically, it does not account for inputs that are not lists or contain non-integer elements. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program incorrectly assumes that the input will always be a list of integers, which is not guaranteed as per the output hints.
