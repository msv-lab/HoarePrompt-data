Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is defined to accept a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. This matches the specification in the problem description.

2. **Even Number Filtering**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the `numbers` list. It includes a condition `if num % 2 == 0` to check whether each number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 without a remainder). This correctly identifies even numbers, which is precisely what the problem requires.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list that contains only the even numbers. This is the expected behavior as per the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program also confirm that the function behaves as intended across different inputs:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
   - For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
   - For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Since the function meets all criteria outlined in the problem description and passes the provided test cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
