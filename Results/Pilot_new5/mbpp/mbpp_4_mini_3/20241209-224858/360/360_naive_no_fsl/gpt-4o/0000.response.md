Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through a list of lists, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The assertions provided in the code serve as test cases, and they all pass according to the expected outputs.

To summarize the correctness:
- The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It correctly computes the sum of each sublist and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` as necessary.
- At the end of the iteration, it returns the sublist that has the highest sum.

All potential edge cases appear to be handled:
- If there is a single sublist, it correctly returns that sublist.
- The checks ensure that if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the first one encountered will be returned, which is standard behavior.

Since I could not identify any case where the function fails to meet the requirements, the conclusion is that the implementation is correct.
