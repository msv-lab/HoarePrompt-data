To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The function should return the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

**Testing the Program:**

1. **Basic Functionality:**
   For a simple input:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1]])
   ```
   The expected output is `[4, 5, 6]`, which has the highest sum (15). The program correctly finds this.

2. **All Lists with Same Sum:**
   Consider:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2], [2, 1], [0, 3]])
   ```
   Here, all lists have the same sum of 3. The `max` function will return the first list with the highest sum by default. So, it would return `[1, 2]`, even though `[2, 1]` and `[0, 3]` also yield the same sum. This might not align with the expectation of returning a unique list with the highest sum if there are ties.

3. **Empty List Input:**
   If we input an empty list:
   ```python
   func_1([])
   ```
   This will raise a `ValueError` because `max` cannot operate on an empty sequence. The program does not handle this edge case.

4. **Nested Lists with Mixed Types:**
   If we input:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2], [3, 'a'], [4, 5]])
   ```
   The presence of a string in the second list will cause a `TypeError` when trying to sum the elements, as Python cannot sum numbers and strings together.

5. **Negative Numbers:**
   For input:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, -1], [2, -2], [3, -3], [0]])
   ```
   The expected return is `[1, -1]`, which has the highest sum of `0`. The code correctly handles this case.

Based on the above tests:

- The program fails in the case of an empty input list and does not handle situations with ties properly. 
- It will also raise an error when trying to sum elements of a list containing non-numeric data types.

**Conclusion:**

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing mixed types, which can lead to errors.
