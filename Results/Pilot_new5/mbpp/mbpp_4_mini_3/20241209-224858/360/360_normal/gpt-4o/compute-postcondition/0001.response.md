The variable `max_list` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `list_of_lists` and `max_sum` remain unchanged since no operations have been performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical elements, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), and `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical elements, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list.**
