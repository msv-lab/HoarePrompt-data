To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to focus on the changes made by the line `current_sum = sum(sublist)`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf').
- `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.
- `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_list` is an empty list and `current_sum` is still equal to `sum(sublist)`.
- `list_of_lists` must have at least one more sublist to iterate over.

Now, when we execute the code snippet `current_sum = sum(sublist)`, we are reassigning `current_sum` to the sum of the `sublist`. This means that `current_sum` will now hold a new value equal to `sum(sublist)`.

1. Since `current_sum` is now explicitly assigned the value of `sum(sublist)`, the original value of `current_sum` (which could have been equal to `max_sum`) may or may not change based on the value of `sublist`.
2. The `max_sum` remains unchanged unless there is a conditional statement that modifies it based on the new `current_sum`, but that is not part of the provided code.

Given that `max_list` and `max_sum` are not affected by the current operation, we can summarize the output state based on the updated value of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to the previous `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**.
