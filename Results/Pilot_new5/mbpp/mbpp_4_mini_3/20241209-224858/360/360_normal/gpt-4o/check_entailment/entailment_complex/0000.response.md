Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list contains numerical elements. The function computes the sum of each inner list, tracks the maximum sum encountered, and returns the corresponding inner list that has this maximum sum.

### Explanation of Correctness:

1. **Iterates through sublists**: The function iterates over each inner list in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it calculates the sum using the built-in `sum()` function.

2. **Tracks maximum sum**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure that any sum of a sublist will be greater at the start. It updates `max_sum` whenever it finds a sublist with a sum greater than the current `max_sum`.

3. **Stores the corresponding sublist**: When a new maximum sum is found, it updates `max_list` to the current sublist. This ensures that at the end of the loop, `max_list` contains the sublist with the highest sum.

4. **Handles edge cases correctly**:
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list, which is the expected behavior according to the problem statement.
   - If all inner lists are empty, they will all have a sum of zero, and the function will correctly return the first empty list it encounters.

5. **Test assertions**: The test assertions provided check various scenarios:
   - It verifies that the function returns the correct sublist for given lists, confirming that the implementation meets the requirement of finding the sublist with the maximum sum.

Since the function consistently adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
