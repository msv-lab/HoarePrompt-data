Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to return the sublist from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The implementation correctly initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. It then iterates over each sublist in the `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the sublist, and compares it with the current `max_sum`. If the current sum exceeds `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and assigns the current sublist to `max_list`.

3. **Return Value**: After examining all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which is guaranteed to hold the sublist with the highest sum. The program also correctly handles the case where `list_of_lists` is empty by returning an empty list, as `max_list` would remain empty.

4. **Assertion Tests**: The assertion tests given at the top validate the function's correctness for multiple scenarios, including cases with varying lengths of lists and sums. Each assertion checks that the function produces the expected output.

Overall, the program consistently follows the requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that it accurately identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum.
