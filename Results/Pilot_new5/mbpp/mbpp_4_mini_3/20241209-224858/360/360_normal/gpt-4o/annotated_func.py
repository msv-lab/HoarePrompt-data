#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist corresponding to that maximum sum, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical elements. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is float('-inf') and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist 'max_list' corresponding to the maximum sum 'max_sum' from 'list_of_lists', which contains numerical elements. If 'list_of_lists' is empty, 'max_list' is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list contains numerical elements. It computes the sum of each inner list and returns the sublist that has the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns an empty list. If all inner lists are empty, the function still returns an empty list as `max_list`.
