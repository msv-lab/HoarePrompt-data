The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list contains numerical elements. It computes the sum of each inner list and returns the sublist that has the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns an empty list. If all inner lists are empty, the function still returns an empty list as `max_list`.
