The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Given that `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, we can conclude that `sublist` has a specific value that affects the output. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf'); `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`; `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in the `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf'); `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`; `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in the `list_of_lists`.**
