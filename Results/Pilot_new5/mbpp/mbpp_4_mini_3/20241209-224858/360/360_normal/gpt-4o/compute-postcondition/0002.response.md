According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is float('-inf') indicating that no valid sums have been calculated yet, and `max_list` remains an empty list since it is not modified before the loop starts. 

For the loop to be executed, `list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in the `list_of_lists`. 

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list_of_lists**
