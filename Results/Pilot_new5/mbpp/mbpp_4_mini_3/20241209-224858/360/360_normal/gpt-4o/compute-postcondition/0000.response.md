The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value `float('-inf')`, which represents negative infinity in Python. This means that `max_sum` now holds the lowest possible value, allowing it to be easily replaced by any sum of numerical elements in subsequent calculations. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements; `max_sum` is float('-inf').**
