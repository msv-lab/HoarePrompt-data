The function accepts a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats), and returns the inner list that has the maximum sum of its numerical elements. If the input list is empty, it will return an empty list or raise a ValueError depending on the implementation of the `max` function in Python. The function does not handle cases where all inner lists are empty.
