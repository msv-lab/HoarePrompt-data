To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program against the requirement.

### Problem description:
The function should take two lists and replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case when `list1` is not empty:**
   - The line `list1[-1:] = list2` will replace the last element of `list1` with all elements from `list2`. 
   - This is correct and satisfies the requirement.

2. **Case when `list1` is empty:**
   - The line `list1 = list2` does not modify `list1` in place. Instead, it creates a new local variable `list1` that is assigned `list2`, but this does not change the original `list1` that was passed as an argument.
   - After this operation, the function will return the newly created local `list1`, which is not the expected behavior as it does not modify the original `list1` passed to the function.

### Example of failure:
If we call the function with:
```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = func_1(list1, list2)
print(result)  # This will print [1, 2, 3], but list1 remains empty.
print(list1)   # This will still print [], demonstrating that the original list was not modified.
```

In this case, the original `list1` is not changed as expected. 

### Conclusion:
Since there is a case where the program does not meet the specification (namely when `list1` is empty), the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
