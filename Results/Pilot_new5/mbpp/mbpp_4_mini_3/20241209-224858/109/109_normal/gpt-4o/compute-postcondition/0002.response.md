Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that includes all elements of `list1` except the last one concatenated with all elements of `list2`. It assumes that `list1` contains at least one element; if `list1` has only one element, the result will be `list2` alone. There are no checks for the empty state of `list2`, so `list2` can be empty, resulting in the output being just the modified `list1`. **
