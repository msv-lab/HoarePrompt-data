Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`, it lacks robustness in its handling of input. Specifically, the function does not check if `s` is a valid string; it may raise an error if `s` is `None` or another type that does not support the `count` method (e.g., an integer).

To ensure that the program meets the problem description in all potential cases, it should validate the input type. If `s` is not a string, the function should either return an error or a specific value (like 0) to indicate that there are no occurrences of 'std'.

In summary, the program fails to handle cases where `s` is `None` or not a string, leading to incorrect behavior and potential runtime errors. Hence, it does not meet the problem description's requirements in every potential case.
