Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality of counting the occurrences of the string 'std' in a given input string. The use of the `count` method directly aligns with the problem description, as it accurately counts the non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' in any string `s`. 

Since the method handles various cases (including empty strings and strings without the substring), there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirement. For example:

- `func_1("std")` returns 1.
- `func_1("stdstd")` returns 2.
- `func_1("abcd")` returns 0.
- `func_1("")` returns 0.

All possible scenarios align with the requirements, confirming the correctness of the program.
