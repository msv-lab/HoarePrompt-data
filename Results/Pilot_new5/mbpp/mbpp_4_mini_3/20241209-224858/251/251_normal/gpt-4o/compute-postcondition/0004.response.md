Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns the polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `theta` is the angle in radians calculated using the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`. There are no edge cases handled for `x` or `y` being `0`, which could potentially lead to a situation where `theta` is undefined when both are zero, but in practice, the function correctly calculates and returns values even in these cases.**
