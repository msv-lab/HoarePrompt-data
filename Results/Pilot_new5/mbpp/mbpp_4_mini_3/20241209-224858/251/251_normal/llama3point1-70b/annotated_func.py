#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r which is equal to the hypotenuse of the coordinates (x, y) and phi which is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point numbers `x` and `y` representing rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns `r`, which is the hypotenuse of the coordinates (the distance from the origin to the point (x, y)), and `phi`, which is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). The function does not handle edge cases such as when both `x` and `y` are zero, where the angle may be undefined.
