The function accepts two floating-point numbers `x` and `y` representing rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns `r`, which is the hypotenuse of the coordinates (the distance from the origin to the point (x, y)), and `phi`, which is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). The function does not handle edge cases such as when both `x` and `y` are zero, where the angle may be undefined.
