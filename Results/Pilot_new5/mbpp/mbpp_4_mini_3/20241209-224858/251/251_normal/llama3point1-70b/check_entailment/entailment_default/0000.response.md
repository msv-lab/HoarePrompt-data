Let's analyze the given program and its description.

**Problem description**: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

**Program**:
```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)
```

In this program, `math.hypot(x, y)` correctly calculates the hypotenuse, which represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). The function `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y).

### Initial Assessment
The program seems to meet the primary requirements of the problem description. It takes two arguments (rectangular coordinates x and y) and correctly converts them into polar coordinates (r, φ).

### Edge Cases
However, one potential edge case is when both `x` and `y` are zero. In this scenario:
- The distance `r` will be 0, which is correct.
- The angle `phi` is mathematically undefined for (0, 0). The behavior of `math.atan2(0, 0)` in Python will return 0.0, which may not be appropriate since there is no specific angle defined at the origin.

### Output hints
The output hints state that the function does not handle the case when both `x` and `y` are zero, where the angle may be undefined. This aligns with our assessment of the edge case.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle the edge case of (0, 0) correctly—where the angle is theoretically undefined—it does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to address the issue when both `x` and `y` are zero, resulting in an angle that is not well-defined.
