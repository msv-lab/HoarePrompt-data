Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The calculations for r (the radius) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and for θ (the angle) using \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \) are implemented appropriately. The provided assertions test some valid inputs, and they return the expected results. Since I can't identify any inconsistencies or edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
