Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) using the formulas:
- \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) (which is implemented using `math.hypot(x, y)`)
- \( \phi = \tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}) \) (which is implemented using `math.atan2(y, x)`)

The `math.atan2` function appropriately handles all quadrants of the Cartesian plane and the case where \( x = 0 \), ensuring that φ is calculated correctly. Additionally, it returns the angle in radians, which is the standard output expected for polar coordinates.

Since the implementation accurately adheres to the problem requirements without omitting any edge cases, the code is deemed correct.
