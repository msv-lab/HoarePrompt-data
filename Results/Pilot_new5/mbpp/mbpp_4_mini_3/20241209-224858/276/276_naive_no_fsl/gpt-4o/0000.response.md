Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size according to the problem description. The logic in the function follows these steps:

1. It merges the two input lists and sorts the combined list.
2. It calculates the middle index of the merged list.
3. It checks if the length of the merged list is even or odd:
   - If even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.
   - If odd, it returns the middle element directly.

The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. 

Additionally, since the problem specifies that the lists are of the same size, the function is designed accordingly, and edge cases (such as handling empty lists or lists of different sizes) are not applicable based on the problem constraints. Thus, no example can be found that demonstrates incorrect behavior. 

Overall, the implementation meets the requirements and handles the specified cases correctly.
