Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Assumption of Input Sizes**: The function assumes that both input lists are of the same positive length `n`. However, the program does not include any validation to check if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are indeed equal or if they are both positive. If the lists are of different sizes or if either list is empty, the program may produce incorrect results or raise an error (e.g., `IndexError`).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists of different sizes, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The problem description requires the function to handle two sorted lists of the same size, but the implementation lacks the necessary checks to ensure that the inputs meet this criterion.

In summary, the program's failure to validate input sizes and handle edge cases means it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description consistently, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
