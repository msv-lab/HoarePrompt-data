The value of `mid` is assigned the value of `len(merged_list) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the length of `merged_list` by 2. The states of the other variables, `list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list`, remain unchanged. Since `merged_list` contains all integers from `list1` and `list2`, its length is dependent on `n`, the size of both input lists. Therefore, `mid` will be equal to `n` (the size of `list1`) if `merged_list` has 2n elements or less. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of size `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`.**
