`median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. Since `size` is an odd integer, `middle_index` evaluates to `size - 1`. Therefore, `median` will be the last element in the merged list because the middle index for an odd-sized list points to the central element when counting from zero. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer such that size > 0, `size` is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is the element at index `size - 1` of `merged_list`.**
