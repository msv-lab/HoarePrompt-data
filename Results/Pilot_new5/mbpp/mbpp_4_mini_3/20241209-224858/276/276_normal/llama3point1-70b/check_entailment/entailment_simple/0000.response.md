To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the function accurately finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The function must find the median of two sorted lists (list1 and list2) that have the same size.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes in two sorted lists (`list1`, `list2`) and an integer (`size`) which represents the length of both lists.
2. It merges the two lists and sorts them into `merged_list`.
3. The function then calculates the median based on the size:
   - If `size` is even, it averages the two middle elements of `merged_list`.
   - If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element.
4. The function returns the calculated median.

### Evaluation of the Program:
- The program correctly merges two lists and sorts them, which is necessary to find the median.
- The `middle_index` is correctly defined as `size - 1`, but when calculating the median for even sizes, it incorrectly accesses `merged_list[middle_index + 1]` and averages it with `merged_list[middle_index]`. 
- This is incorrect when `size` is even because the middle elements should be `merged_list[size // 2 - 1]` and `merged_list[size // 2]`, not the last two elements of the merged list.

### Key Issue:
- The program fails for even-sized lists. For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, then:
  - Merged list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - The correct median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.
  - However, using the current implementation would calculate `median` as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which seems correct. But it incorrectly uses the indices based on the assumption of the sorted list's length without proper calculation for both even and odd cases.

### Conclusion:
Despite the function working for specific cases, it fundamentally miscalculates the indices when accessing elements for even sizes and doesn't properly account for accessing the correct middle elements with respect to the merged list length.

Correctness: **False**
