The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order, the resulting `merged_list` will also be sorted. The sizes of `list1` and `list2` are equal to the positive integer `size`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer such that size > 0 and size is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
