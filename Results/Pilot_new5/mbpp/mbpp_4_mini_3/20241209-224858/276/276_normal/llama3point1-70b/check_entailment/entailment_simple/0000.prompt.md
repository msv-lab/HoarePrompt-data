You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, and size is a positive integer such that size > 0 and size is equal to the lengths of both list1 and list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the lengths of both lists, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the `median` is equal to `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. Otherwise, the `median` is the element at index `size - 1` of `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, which is determined based on the value of `size` and the contents of `merged_list`. If `size` is even, it is the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it is the middle element of `merged_list`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
