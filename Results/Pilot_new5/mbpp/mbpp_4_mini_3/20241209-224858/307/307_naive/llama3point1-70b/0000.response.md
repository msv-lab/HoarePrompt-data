Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. However, the condition in the while loop checks for `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`, meaning it will return the index as soon as it finds a triangular number with `n` or more digits, rather than one with exactly `n` digits.

For example, if `n = 3`, the program will return the index of the first triangular number with at least 3 digits, which is 6 (the triangular number is 21, which has 2 digits), instead of correctly identifying the triangular number at index 8 (36) as the first with exactly 3 digits (the first triangular number with 3 digits is 5050). Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
