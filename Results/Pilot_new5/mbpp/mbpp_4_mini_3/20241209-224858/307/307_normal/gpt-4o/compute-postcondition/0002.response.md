`triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, the calculation is as follows: `triangular_number = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which results in `triangular_number = 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**.
