Since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any of the states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
