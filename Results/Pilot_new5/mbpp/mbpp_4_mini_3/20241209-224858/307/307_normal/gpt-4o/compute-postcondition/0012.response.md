Since the `while` loop is a `while True`, it is designed to execute indefinitely unless interrupted by a break or an exit statement. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the state variables.

State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
