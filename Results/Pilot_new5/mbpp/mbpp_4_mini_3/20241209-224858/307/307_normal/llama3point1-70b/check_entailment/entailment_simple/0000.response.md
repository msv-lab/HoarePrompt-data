Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Understanding Triangular Numbers**: A triangular number for a given integer `idx` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This means that for each positive integer `idx`, the program generates the corresponding triangular number.

2. **Digit Count**: The program checks the number of digits in the calculated triangular number using `len(str(triangular_num))`. This converts the triangular number to a string and calculates its length, which effectively counts the number of digits.

3. **Looping Until Condition is Met**: The program contains a `while True` loop that continues until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits. It starts with `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the condition is satisfied.

4. **Return Value**: When it finds the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits, it returns the corresponding `idx`. This is exactly what is required by the problem statement: to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

5. **Correctness for All Cases**: The logic in the program ensures that it will always find the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits because it systematically checks each triangular number in increasing order of `idx`. 

Therefore, the program does what the problem description asks for, ensuring that it will return the correct index for any positive integer `n` that represents the number of digits in the triangular number.
