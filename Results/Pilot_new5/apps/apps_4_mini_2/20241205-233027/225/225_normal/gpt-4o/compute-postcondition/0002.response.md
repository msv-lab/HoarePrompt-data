The code assigns the value -1 to `prev_pos`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `max_jump` is 1; `prev_pos` is -1.
