The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100. The function calculates and returns the maximum jump, which is defined as the maximum of the previous maximum jump and the difference between the length of the string `s` and the index of the last vowel found in `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` and return the maximum jump based on the position of the last vowel in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a non-empty string of capital English letters, and returns the maximum jump calculated based on the last vowel found in the string.**
