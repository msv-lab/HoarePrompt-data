To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be at least 1. This means that the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once because `n` is positive.

2. The variable `i` in the loop will take values from 0 to `n-1`. Thus, at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0.

3. The other variables `max_jump` and `last_vowel` do not directly influence the ability of the loop to execute, but they may be relevant for the body of the loop depending on its implementation. However, since the loop's execution is based solely on the variable `n`, we only need to ensure that `n` is set appropriately.

Based on the analysis, the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should start at 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer (which it is, given that `s` is non-empty).
- There are no additional adjustments needed for `max_jump` and `last_vowel` for the loop to run.

Thus, the final state can be articulated as follows:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1**
