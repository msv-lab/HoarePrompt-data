The value of `max_jump` is updated based on the expression `max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`. The variable `i` has the value 2. The value of `last_vowel` will determine the calculation: if `s[i]` (which is `s[2]`) is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is updated to 1; if not, `last_vowel` remains -1.

If `s[2]` is a vowel (let's denote it as `V`), then the calculation becomes:
- `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (2 - 1) // 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `max(max_jump, 1)`.

If `s[2]` is not a vowel (let's denote it as `N`), then:
- `last_vowel` stays -1, and `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (2 - (-1)) // 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `max(max_jump, 2)`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `s[2]`:
1. If `s[2]` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1, and `max_jump` is either its previous value or 1.
2. If `s[2]` is not a vowel, then `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` is either its previous value or 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is either 1 if `s[2]` is a vowel or -1 if not, and `max_jump` is updated accordingly.**
