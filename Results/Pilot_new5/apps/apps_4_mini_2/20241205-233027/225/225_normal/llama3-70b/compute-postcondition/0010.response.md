To evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we analyze the assignment involved in the expression `max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`. 

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_jump` is 0.
   - `last_vowel` is not equal to -1.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` (`s[i]`) is a vowel, meaning `s[0]` is in `vowels`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - Given `i` is 0, we need the value of `last_vowel`. Since `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, it must be some valid index of a previous vowel in the string. 
   - The expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` simplifies to `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 
   - This means we need to analyze the value of `last_vowel`. Assuming `last_vowel` is some positive integer reflecting the index of the last vowel prior to index 0, the expression will yield an integer based on this index.

3. **Result**:
   - The `max` function compares the current value of `max_jump`, which is 0, with the computed value `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `last_vowel` is a valid index, `(0 - last_vowel)` will be negative or zero, thus yielding a floor division by 2 which will likely be less than or equal to 0. Adding 1 will result in a value of at least 1 if `last_vowel` is greater than -2.
   - Consequently, `max_jump` will be updated to the new computed value.

4. **Output State**:
   - After the execution, we see that `max_jump` may take the new value based on the calculation, while all other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Combining this analysis, the output state can be encapsulated concisely. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, `max_jump` is max(0, (0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**
