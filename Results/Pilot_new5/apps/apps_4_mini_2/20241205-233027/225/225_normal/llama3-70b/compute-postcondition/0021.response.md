The variable `max_jump` is updated using the expression `max(max_jump, i + 1)`. Since `i` is currently 2, the value of `i + 1` would be 3. The function `max()` compares the current value of `max_jump` with 3 and assigns the higher value back to `max_jump`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is either updated to 1 or remains -1, `max_jump` is updated to max(`max_jump`, 3)**.
