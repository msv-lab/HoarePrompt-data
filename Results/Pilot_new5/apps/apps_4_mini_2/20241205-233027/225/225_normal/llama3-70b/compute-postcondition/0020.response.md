According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of string `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 2. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 2, as `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if `s[i]` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` must be updated to 1; if `s[i]` is not a vowel, `last_vowel` remains -1.**
