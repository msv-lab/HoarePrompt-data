Postcondition: ***`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500. If the greatest common divisor of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the greatest common divisor is greater than 1, it indicates that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` share a common factor.***
