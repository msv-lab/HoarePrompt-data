The function reads three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` from user input (each between 1 and 1500) and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD). It prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1 (indicating that the numbers are coprime), and 'NO' if the GCD is greater than 1 (indicating that they share a common factor). The function does not accept any parameters and relies on user input for its operation.
