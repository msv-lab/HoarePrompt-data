The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which indicates that `high` will now be one less than its previous value. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and the variable `zeroes` is also unaffected, as they are not directly involved in the operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
