To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

1. The variable `right` is defined as `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + 1`, which means it is always a positive integer and will adjust based on the value of `m`.
2. The variable `m` is specified as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\).
3. The `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m`, which means we need to ensure that the function `func_1` returns `m` when called with the current `right` value.

Since `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, this implies that the function may be influenced by the number of zeroes, and it's possible that `func_1(right)` does not return `m` under the given conditions.

To ensure that the loop executes, we can modify the state so that `func_1(right)` returns exactly `m`. This requires us to ensure that the conditions for `func_1(right)` to equal `m` are met.

Given the information we have, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` must be adjusted to ensure func_1(right) equals m, `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + 1.**
