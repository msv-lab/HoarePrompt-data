The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `right` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + 2`, so the new value of `right` becomes `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + 3`. 

Output State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` must be adjusted to ensure func_1(right) equals m, `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + 3**
