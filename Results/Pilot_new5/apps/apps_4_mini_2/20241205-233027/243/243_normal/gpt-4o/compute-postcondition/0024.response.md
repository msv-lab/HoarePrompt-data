According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(right)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is defined as `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + 2`. 

Since we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the next iteration, we must adjust `zeroes` to maintain this condition. The problem statement indicates that `zeroes` must be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, to guarantee that the condition `func_1(right) == m` holds true for the next iteration, we focus on ensuring the value of `zeroes` is set correctly based on the expected behavior of `func_1` at the current value of `right`.

State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` must be adjusted to ensure func_1(right) equals m, `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + 2**
