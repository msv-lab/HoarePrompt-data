According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `func_1(right)`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `right` has been incremented by 1. However, we do not know if `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m` after this increment, as `func_1(right)` might yield a different result than it did before the increment.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. 

Since the only change we know is that `right` has been incremented, we need to adjust the condition to ensure that after the increment, `func_1(right)` still equals `m`.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is incremented by 1**
