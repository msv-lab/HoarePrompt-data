According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will execute if `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is 5 * (m + 1), which is always going to be greater than or equal to 5 (since m is a positive integer). Therefore, the condition `low <= high` is satisfied, and the loop can execute one time.

No adjustments are needed for the states in order for the loop to execute.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list.**
