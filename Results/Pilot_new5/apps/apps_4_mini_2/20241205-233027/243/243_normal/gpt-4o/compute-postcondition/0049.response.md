Given the initial state and the provided code, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. The variable `right` is being incremented by 1.
2. The condition states that `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, and `left` is defined as the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1.
3. The variable `m` is confirmed to be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000.
4. The variable `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, and `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
5. The list `result` is initialized as empty, and `right` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

The impact of the code is that the value of `right` is increased by 1, but no other variables are altered or affected by this execution.

Output State: **`func_1(left) is not equal to m, left is the last value where func_1(left) was equal to m minus 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, zeroes is equal to func_1(mid), mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, result is an empty list, right is increased by 1.**
