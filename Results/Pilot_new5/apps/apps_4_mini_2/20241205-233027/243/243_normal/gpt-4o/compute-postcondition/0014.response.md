To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `left` is calculated as `(5 * m + 5) // 2`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `func_1(left)` returns exactly `m`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop requires `func_1(left)` to be equal to `m` for it to execute at least once.

3. **Current State**:
   - Given that `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)` and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, we do not have information about the relationship between `func_1(left)` and `m` directly. Hence we cannot conclude if `func_1(left)` is equal to `m` right now.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `func_1(left) == m`. Since we do not have information about the function `func_1`, we can't determine how `left` is processed. Therefore, we would need to ensure the output of `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.

Since there are no specific constraints given for `left`, we cannot adjust its value directly. However, we can say that there needs to be a condition met for the output of `func_1(left)`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, and `func_1(left) must equal m`**
