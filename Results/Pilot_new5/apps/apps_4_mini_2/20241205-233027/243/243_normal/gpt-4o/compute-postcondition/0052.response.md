According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must remain equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` has just been increased by 1, which means that after this increment, it is now pointing to a new value and we need to ensure that when checking `func_1(right)`, it still equals `m`. 

Since `right` was just increased, we cannot guarantee that `func_1(right)` will still equal `m` unless we have a specific condition or range for `right`. Therefore, we must adjust the state such that `func_1(right)` equals `m` after the increment. 

Since `right` is now increased by 1, we can't be certain whether `func_1(right)` equals `m` without further checks. Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should ensure that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.

State: **`func_1(left) is not equal to m, left is the last value where func_1(left) was equal to m minus 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, zeroes is equal to func_1(mid), mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, result is an empty list, right is increased by 1, and func_1(right) must be equal to m`**
