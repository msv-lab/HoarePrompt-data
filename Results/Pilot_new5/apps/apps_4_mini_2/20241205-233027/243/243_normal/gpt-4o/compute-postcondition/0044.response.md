According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` has been adjusted to `left - 1`, and `func_1(left)` still equals `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be adjusted to ensure that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.

Since `left` has already been decreased by 1, we need to ensure that the next value of `left` (which would be `left - 1` again) still results in `func_1(left)` equal to `m`. This means we need to make sure that `func_1(left - 1)` equals `m`. Hence, `left` must be set to a value such that `func_1(left - 1)` still equals `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left must be adjusted to a value such that func_1(left - 1) equals m**
