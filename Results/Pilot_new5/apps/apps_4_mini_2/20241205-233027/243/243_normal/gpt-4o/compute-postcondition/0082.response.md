The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. The conditions related to `left`, `mid`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is incremented to `right + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is incremented to `right + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
