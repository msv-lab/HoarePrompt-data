The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The variables `m`, `low`, and `high` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `mid` while maintaining the constraints on `m`, `low`, and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
