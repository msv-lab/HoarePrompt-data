The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + (n + 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
