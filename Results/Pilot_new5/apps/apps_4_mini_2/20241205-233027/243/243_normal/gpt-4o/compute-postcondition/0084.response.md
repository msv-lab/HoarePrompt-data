Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is reassigned with `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `result` becomes a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, while `right` is incremented by `k`, the number of loop executions, with `func_1(right)` not equal to `m`, and the most inner loop or if statement is exited.***
