According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` and its relationship to `m`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. Right before the loop, `left` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`. However, we do not have information about `func_1(left)` in relation to `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer and we know `zeroes`, but `func_1(left)` is not explicitly defined, we can't assure that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. Since we don't have a specific value for `func_1(left)`, we can conclude that the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2, and func_1(left) must be equal to m**
