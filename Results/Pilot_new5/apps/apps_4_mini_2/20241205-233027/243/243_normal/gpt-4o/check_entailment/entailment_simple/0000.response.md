To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the functionality of the code and its behavior according to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to find how many positive integers \( n \) exist such that \( n! \) (the factorial of \( n \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \( n \), because pairs of 2s and 5s contribute to trailing zeroes (and there are usually more 2s than 5s).

### Program Structure
1. The program reads an integer \( m \).
2. It calls `func_2(m)` which aims to find all \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
3. Within `func_2`, binary search is used to find a range of integers \( n \) that both give exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes when their factorial is computed.

### Function Analysis
- **`func_1(n)`**: This function computes the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) using the formula that counts how many times the factors of 5 can be formed from the numbers leading up to \( n \). This function correctly implements the logic needed to find the number of trailing zeroes in factorials.
  
- **`func_2(m)`**: This function implements a binary search to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) has at least \( m \) trailing zeroes. It then expands to find the range of values that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. If \( zeroes < m \), it moves the lower bound up; if \( zeroes > m \), it moves the upper bound down. The search continues until the correct range is found.

### Key Considerations
- The construction of `func_2` ensures that it finds all integers \( n \) which satisfy the condition, as it checks both left and right of the found point for exact matches.
- The return value is a list of integers representing valid \( n \), which aligns with the output requirements.
- The output also correctly handles the case where no integers meet the requirement (by returning 0).

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description requirements:
- It correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes.
- It effectively finds all integers \( n \) whose factorial ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
- The output format matches the expected specification.

Given all of the above, the program correctly implements the solution as specified by the problem description.
