To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code, its implementation, and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) (the factorial of \( n \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeros.

### Functions Overview
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \( n! \).
   - It achieves this by counting how many times \( n \) can be divided by powers of 5 (since the number of trailing zeros is determined by pairs of factors 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2).

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find all integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros.
   - It searches through potential values of \( n \), checking how many trailing zeros each \( n! \) has by calling `func_1(n)`.
   - If it finds \( n \) where \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros, it collects all such \( n \) values in a result list and returns it.

### Edge Cases and Considerations
- The program must correctly identify when there are no integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros.
- It should also ensure that the range it searches is sufficient to cover cases where \( m \) is large.
- An important edge case arises when \( m \) is a number that cannot be represented as the number of trailing zeros in any factorial.

### Output Hints
- Hint for `func_1`: Accurately describes the function and aligns with how trailing zeros are counted.
- Hint for `func_2`: States that it finds integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros and returns an empty list if none are found.

### Analysis of Correctness
The provided functions are logically sound and correctly implement the algorithms needed to solve the problem as described:

- **Function `func_1`** is correctly implemented to calculate the number of trailing zeros.
- **Function `func_2`** uses a binary search method to find \( n \) values effectively and collects those that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. It appears to handle cases where no such integers exist by returning an empty list.

### Potential Issues
The only potential issue lies in the upper bound of \( n \) when searching for trailing zeros. The search space is designated as \( (0, 5 * (m + 1)) \), which should generally be adequate for reasonable \( m \) values. However, it would be prudent to confirm that this indeed covers all edge cases regarding larger \( m \).

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the logic of the functions and the provided output hints, I found no discrepancies or edge cases that would cause the program to fail under the specified constraints. The functions perform as intended according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
