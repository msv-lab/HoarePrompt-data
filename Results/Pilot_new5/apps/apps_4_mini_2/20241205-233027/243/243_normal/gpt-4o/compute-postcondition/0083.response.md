Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, while `right` is incremented to `right + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, with `func_1(right)` not equal to `m`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
