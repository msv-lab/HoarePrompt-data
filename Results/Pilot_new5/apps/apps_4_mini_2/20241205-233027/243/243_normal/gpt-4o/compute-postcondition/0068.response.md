To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the `while` loop condition. 

The loop is defined as `while func_1(left) == m:`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the return value of `func_1(left)` must remain equal to `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates:
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000).
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid - 1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` still equals `m` for the next iteration.

Since `left` is defined as `mid - 1`, if `mid` is not adjusted, `left` will decrease in value during the next iteration, which might cause `func_1(left)` to no longer equal `m`. 

To keep `func_1(left)` equal to `m`, we need to ensure that `left` does not decrease beyond the point necessary to maintain `func_1(left) == m`. Therefore, we must ensure that `left` should not equal `mid - 1` anymore if it leads to a situation where `func_1(left)` could potentially become different from `m`.

Thus, the adjustment needed is for `left` to either remain constant or to be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` will still return `m`.

Since we do not have specific information about how `func_1` behaves relative to `left`, we cannot definitively determine how `left` must be adjusted, but we can assert that the current state of `left` needs to be verified to keep the condition true.

The most straightforward adjustment is to ensure that `left` is set to a value that still satisfies `func_1(left) == m`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment, while keeping the other state variables intact, would be that `left` must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` must be adjusted such that func_1(left) equals `m`.**
