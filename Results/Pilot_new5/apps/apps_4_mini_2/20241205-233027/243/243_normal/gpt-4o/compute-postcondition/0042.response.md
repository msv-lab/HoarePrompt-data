According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. The loop will continue executing as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `func_1(left)` must currently equal `m`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` continues to equal `m`. 

Given that `left` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, and the current state indicates that `func_1(left)` is already equal to `m`, we do not have enough information on how `func_1` behaves with respect to `left` to ensure the loop executes again unless we know that `left` needs to be decreased further (to possibly `left - 1`) or adjusted such that it still satisfies the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `left` is decreased or remains at a value where `func_1(left)` can still yield `m` in the next iteration.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.**
