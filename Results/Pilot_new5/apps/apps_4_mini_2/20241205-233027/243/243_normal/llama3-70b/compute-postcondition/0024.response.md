The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is not specified but is an integer, so the new value of `n` will be `n + 1`. The state of the other variable `ans`, which is an updated list containing the previous elements plus the current value of `n`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer and now `n` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` still contains the previous elements plus the value of the previous `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n` is equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is an updated list containing the previous elements plus the current value of `n`.**
