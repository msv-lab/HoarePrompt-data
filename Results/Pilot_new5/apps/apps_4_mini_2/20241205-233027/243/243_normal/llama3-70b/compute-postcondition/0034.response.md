The value of `n` is incremented by 1, which means `n` will now hold a value that is one greater than its previous ambiguous integer value. The variable `ans`, which contains the previous elements plus the current value of `n`, will now include the updated value of `n` after the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now `previous_value_of_n + 1`, and `ans` includes previous elements plus `previous_value_of_n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is now `previous_value_of_n + 1`, `ans` contains previous elements plus `previous_value_of_n + 1`.**
