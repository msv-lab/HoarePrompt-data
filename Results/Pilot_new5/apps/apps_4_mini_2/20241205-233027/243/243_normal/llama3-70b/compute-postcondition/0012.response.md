According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue executing indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, it is guaranteed that the loop can execute one more time regardless of the current program state. 

No adjustments are necessary since the loop will run again without any conditions preventing it.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1**
