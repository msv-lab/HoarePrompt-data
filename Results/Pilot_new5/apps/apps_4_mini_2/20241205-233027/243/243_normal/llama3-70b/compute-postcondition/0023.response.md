The code `ans.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer, the value of `n` will be added to `ans`, which will change the state of `ans` by increasing its length by one and including the value of `n`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ans` is an updated list containing the previous elements plus the current value of `n`.**
