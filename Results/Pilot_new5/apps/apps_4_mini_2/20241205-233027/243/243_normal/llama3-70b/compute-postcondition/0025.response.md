According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a break condition is met within the loop body. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time without requiring any adjustments to the current state.

State: **`n` is an integer, `n` is equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is an updated list containing the previous elements plus the current value of `n`**
