Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute.

State: **If m is 1, `count` is 0; if m is greater than 1, `count` is 1; `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
