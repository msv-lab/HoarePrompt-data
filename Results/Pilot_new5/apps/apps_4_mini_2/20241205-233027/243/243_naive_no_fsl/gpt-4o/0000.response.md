To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets all specified requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: An integer `m`, which indicates the required number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
2. **Output**: The number of integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, followed by the integers themselves.

### Logic of the Provided Code:
1. The code reads an integer `m` from input.
2. It defines `func_1` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the factors of 5 (since the number of trailing zeroes is determined by pairs of factors of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2).
3. It defines `func_2` to find all integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes:
   - It uses a binary search approach to narrow down the range of `n`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, it checks how many trailing zeroes `mid!` has. 
   - If it finds a match (i.e., exactly `m` trailing zeroes), it searches both left and right to find the full range of integers that satisfy this condition.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case m = 1**: The program correctly identifies that `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` all have exactly 1 trailing zero, resulting in the output "5\n5 6 7 8 9".
2. **Case m = 5**: The program identifies that no values of `n` yield exactly 5 trailing zeroes, resulting in the output "0".
3. **Case m = 0**: The program does not handle the case where `m` is zero (which isn't specified in the problem description but is a valid edge case). This would output an empty set when it should logically return \( n = 0 \) (i.e., only `0!` has 0 trailing zeroes).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the input `m = 0`, which is a potential edge case not covered in the logic. Since it does not account for all possible valid inputs as per the problem description, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not work correctly because it does not return the expected results for the case when `m = 0`, and potentially other scenarios or edge cases may exist that are not tested or handled.
