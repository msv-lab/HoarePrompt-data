Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, and `dp[i]` contains the minimum costs to achieve a volume from 0 to `i` based on the available volumes defined by `vol`, which are `2^j - 1` for `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and `j` is in the range `[0, n-1]` for all iterations.**
