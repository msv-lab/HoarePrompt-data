Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and `dp[1]` as the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol]` plus `costs[j]`. The values of `j` and `vol` remain unchanged.***
