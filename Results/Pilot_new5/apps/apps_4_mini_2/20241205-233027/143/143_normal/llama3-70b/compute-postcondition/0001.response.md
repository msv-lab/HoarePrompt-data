The variable `costs` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split into separate string elements. The `input()` function takes a line of input where the user provides multiple integers separated by spaces. The `map(int, ...)` converts each of these string numbers into integers. The initial state of `c` is not directly affected, but `costs` will contain a new list of integers based on the input provided. 

The output state will reflect that `costs` is now a list of integers, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30; `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided.**
