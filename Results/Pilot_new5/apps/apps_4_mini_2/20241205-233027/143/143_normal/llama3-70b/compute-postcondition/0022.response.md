Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, and `dp[i]` contains the minimum costs to achieve a volume from 0 to `L`, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0. The current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
