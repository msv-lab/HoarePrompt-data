Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1; for `i` in range n to 30, `dp[i]` is updated based on previous values: `dp[i]` is `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, resulting in the final values for `dp[i]` being the minimum between the original cost and double the previous dp value; `i` is 31 (loop completes).**
