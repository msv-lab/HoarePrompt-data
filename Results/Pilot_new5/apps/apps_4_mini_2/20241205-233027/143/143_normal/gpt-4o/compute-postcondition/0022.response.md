Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 30; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is 0; `L` is greater than or equal to `1 << 30` minus `1 << 30` which results in `L` equal to 0; and `current_cost` remains unchanged since `dp[30]` is undefined.**
