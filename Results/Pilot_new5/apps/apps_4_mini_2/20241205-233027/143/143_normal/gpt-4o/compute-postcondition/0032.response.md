The variable `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, which is equivalent to subtracting `2^28` since `i` is 28. The states of the other variables (`dp`, `current_cost`, `answer`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 28; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`; `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28]); L is updated to L - 2^28.**
