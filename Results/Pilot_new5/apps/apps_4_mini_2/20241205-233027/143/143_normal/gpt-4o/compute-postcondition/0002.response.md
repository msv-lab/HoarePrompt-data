The variable `c` is assigned the value of `costs` concatenated with a list containing `max_cost`, repeated enough times to ensure that the total length of `c` is 31. The value of `max_cost` is 10, and since `costs` contains `n` integers (where `n` is between 1 and 30), the number of times `max_cost` is repeated will be `31 - n`. Therefore, `c` will contain `n` integers from `costs` followed by `10` repeated `31 - n` times. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10, and `c` is a list of `n` integers from `costs` followed by 10 repeated `31 - n` times.**
