To evaluate the effect of the code snippet, we first consider the initialization of the `dp` array and the value of `i`.

- `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1, meaning that for indices 0 to n-1, `dp[i]` is assigned the lesser value of 10 or the corresponding `costs[i]`.
- For `i` in range n to 30, `dp[i]` is initialized to 10.
- The value of `i` is currently 1.

Now, we execute the line of code: 

```
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
```

Here, we are updating `dp[i]`, which is `dp[1]`. 

1. We need to find `dp[1]` and `dp[0]`.
   - `dp[1]` is `min(10, costs[1])` (since `1` is less than `n`).
   - `dp[0]` is `min(10, costs[0])` (also less than `n`).
   
2. The expression `dp[i - 1] * 2` becomes `dp[0] * 2`, which will be used to compare with the current `dp[1]`.

Now, the value of `dp[1]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[0] * 2`.

Let's summarize this:

- `dp[1]` is updated based on the values of `dp[0]` and the defined expression.
- The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Thus, we express the updated output state:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1; `dp[i]` is 10 for `i` in range n to 30; `i` is 1; `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], dp[0] * 2)`**.
