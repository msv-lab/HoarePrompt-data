The value of `current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 29, `dp[29]` is equal to `min(10, costs[29])`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 29; `answer` is the minimum of `max_cost` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`; `current_cost` is now equal to `previous current_cost + dp[29]`; variable `L` is used for comparison but not defined.
