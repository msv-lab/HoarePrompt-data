The statement `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` assigns the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `c[i]` to `dp[i]`. Since `i` is currently 0, the code will specifically update `dp[0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

The state of the variables is as follows:
- `n` remains between 1 and 30.
- `i` remains 0.
- `dp[0]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 0, `dp[0]` is updated to min(dp[0], c[0])**.
