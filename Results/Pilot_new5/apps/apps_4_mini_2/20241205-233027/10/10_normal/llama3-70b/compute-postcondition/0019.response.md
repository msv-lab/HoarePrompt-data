The value of `right` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `right`, it is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list, and `right` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list, `right` is increased by 1**.
