To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check if it fulfills the requirements specified.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of sofas `d` and the dimensions `n` and `m` of the storehouse.
   - It then reads the coordinates for each sofa and stores them in a list called `sofas`.
   - Finally, it reads the counts of sofas in each direction (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is designed to count how many sofas are located to the left, right, above, and below the given sofa:
     - It compares the y-coordinates for left/right (same y-value and the x-coordinates differ) and the x-coordinates for top/bottom (same x-value and the y-coordinates differ).
   - The function correctly identifies and counts the number of sofas based on the conditions outlined.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program iterates over each sofa, calls `func_1`, and checks if the counts match the provided conditions.
   - If a match is found, it prints the index (1-based) of the sofa; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Key Requirements from Problem Description:

- The counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom must be calculated correctly based on their coordinates.
- The program must ensure that it identifies the sofa according to the given conditions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
- If no such sofa meets the criteria, it should return -1.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The program satisfies the requirements of the problem description:
- The counting logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the relational positioning of the sofas in the matrix.
- The main loop correctly compares the results from `func_1` against the required counts.
- It handles the case where no sofa meets the conditions by outputting -1.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine Grandpa Maks's sofa based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.

Correctness: **True**
