Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list; if the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `bottom` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `right` and `top`.***
