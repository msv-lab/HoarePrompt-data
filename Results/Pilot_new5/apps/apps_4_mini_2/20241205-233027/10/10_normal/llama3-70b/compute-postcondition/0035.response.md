Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples, and `s` is the third tuple in the list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of `s` while the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, there is no change to `right` and `top`.***
