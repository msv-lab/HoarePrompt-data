Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `sofa` representing the coordinates of a specific sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` where each tuple represents the coordinates of other sofas. It counts and returns the number of sofas that are directly to the left, right, above, and below the specified `sofa`. If there are no other sofas in the list, the function returns counts of 0 for all directions. The function does not consider the case where the coordinates of `sofa` and other sofas may be equal; it only counts when they differ.**
