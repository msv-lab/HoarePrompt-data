Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `right` is increased by 1 and `top` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `right` remains unchanged and `top` is increased by 1.***
