The code initializes four variables: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, each set to 0. The values of these variables are directly changed by the code, while the initial values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2), `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
