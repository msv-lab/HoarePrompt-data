Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is also less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
