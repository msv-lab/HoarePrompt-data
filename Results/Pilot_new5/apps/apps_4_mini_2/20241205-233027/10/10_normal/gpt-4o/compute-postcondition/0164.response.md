Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, `target_sofa` is set to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition holds true.***
