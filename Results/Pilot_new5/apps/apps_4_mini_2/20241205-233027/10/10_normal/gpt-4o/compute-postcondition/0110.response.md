The `continue` statement does not change any variable values. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, but it indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration in the loop.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `right_count[2]`, `left_count[2]`, `bottom_count[2]`, `top_count[2]` are defined, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `j` is initialized to 0, and the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `j`, which is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
