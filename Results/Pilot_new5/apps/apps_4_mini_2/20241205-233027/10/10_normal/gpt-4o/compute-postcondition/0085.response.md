The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1; thus, the second element of the `right_count` list (index 1) is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`, `right_count[1]` is increased by 1.**
