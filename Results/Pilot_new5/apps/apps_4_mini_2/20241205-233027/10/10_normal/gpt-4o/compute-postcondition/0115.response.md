Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1` is assigned sofas[0][0], `y1` is assigned sofas[0][1], `x2` is assigned sofas[0][2], `y2` is assigned sofas[0][3], `j` is 0. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is also less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
