The variable `top_count` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `d`. The initial state of `d` being a positive integer implies that `top_count` will also be a list containing `d` zeros. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates of a sofa in the format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
