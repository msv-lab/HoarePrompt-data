Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then both `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` are increased by 1. If the conditions are not met, neither `right_count[i]` nor `left_count[i]` is modified.***
