Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1.***
