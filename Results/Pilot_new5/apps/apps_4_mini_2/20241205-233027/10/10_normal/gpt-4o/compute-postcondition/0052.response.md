`x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the elements of `sofas` at index `j`, which is 1. The variable `i` is initially 0, and since `i` is not equal to `j`, the else condition does not apply, and there are no changes to `i` or any other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged; thus, the output state will reflect the assignment to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`**.
