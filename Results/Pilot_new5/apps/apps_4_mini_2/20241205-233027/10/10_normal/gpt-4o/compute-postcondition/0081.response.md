According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `d`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `d` is greater than or equal to 2. 

After the last iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2, and `d` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, `j` is 2**
