According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. Since `d` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run, we need to ensure that `d` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must still be greater than 1 after this iteration (since it would decrement by 1 with each iteration). Therefore, the state must reflect that `d` is now reduced by 1.

State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
