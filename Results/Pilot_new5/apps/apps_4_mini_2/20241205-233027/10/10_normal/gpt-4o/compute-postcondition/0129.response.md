The variable `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, which means `right_count[2]` is increased by 1. The values of `d`, `sofas`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged based on the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3, and `right_count[2]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3, `right_count[2]` is incremented by 1**.
