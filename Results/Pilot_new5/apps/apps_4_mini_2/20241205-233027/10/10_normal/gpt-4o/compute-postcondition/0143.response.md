The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, which means that `left_count[2]` will increase by 1. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 4, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[4]`, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 (thus `left_count[2]` is increased by 1).**
