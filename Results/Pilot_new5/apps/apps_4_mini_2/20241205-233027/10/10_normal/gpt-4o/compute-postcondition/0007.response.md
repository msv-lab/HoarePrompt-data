The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are being assigned values based on user input, which is processed by the `map(int, input().strip().split())` function. The initial state does not affect the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`), but the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` will now be integers based on the input received. The specific values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are unknown as they depend on user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that these variables have been updated to integers, but will not specify their exact values.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers from input.**
