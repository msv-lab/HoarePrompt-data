Postcondition: ***`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, `a` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, `b` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`.***
