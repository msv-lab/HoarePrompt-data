#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, which is `x`, since `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and computes their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues to run until `y` becomes 0, at which point it returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. It is important to note that if `y` starts as 0, the function would return `x` immediately without performing any calculations, which is a potential edge case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 100000.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 with parameters (m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where g is the value returned by func_1(a, b) and is not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 100000; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 100000; `g` is equal to 1, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the result of the formula (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9 and is less than the value of k, which is equal to a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 100000; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 100000; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of sum_k, which is the sum of the first k integers, and sum_m, which is the sum of the first m integers minus the sum of the first (k-1) integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It uses the result of `func_1(a, b)` to determine whether to recursively call itself with scaled-down values of `m`, `a`, and `b` if `g` (the output of `func_1`) is not equal to 1. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the triangular number formula for `m`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates and returns the sum of the first `k` integers and the sum of integers from `k` to `m`. The function does not handle potential edge cases related to the behavior of `func_1` and assumes it will always return a value that allows for valid computations in all cases.
