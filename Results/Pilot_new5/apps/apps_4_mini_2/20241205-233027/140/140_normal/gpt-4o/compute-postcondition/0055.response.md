Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1, `queue` now contains `neighbor`, `in_degree[v]` remains equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that still has remaining neighbors.**
