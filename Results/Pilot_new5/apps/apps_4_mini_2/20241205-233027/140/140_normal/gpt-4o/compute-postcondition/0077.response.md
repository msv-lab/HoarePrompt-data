Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor` and the previous elements plus `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, and `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor remaining. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is not 0, the state remains unchanged.***
