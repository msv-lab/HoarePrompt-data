Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` who have had their `in_degree` reduced to 0, `count` is the total number of vertices added to `queue`, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, and all neighbors of `node` have had their `in_degree` decreased by 1. If any neighbor's original `in_degree` was 1, it will now be 0 and included in `queue`.**
