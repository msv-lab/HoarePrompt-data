Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, `queue` contains `neighbor` while `in_degree[v]` remains equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, and `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that still has remaining neighbors.***
