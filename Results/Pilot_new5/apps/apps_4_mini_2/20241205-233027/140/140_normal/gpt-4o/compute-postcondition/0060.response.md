Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, `count` is increased by 1, and `queue` contains at least two neighbors. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.***
