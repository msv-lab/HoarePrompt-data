The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`in_degree[v]`, `graph`, `queue`, and `node`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary; `queue` has one less node after `node = queue.popleft()`; `count` is 1; `node` is assigned the value of the node that was removed from `queue`.**
