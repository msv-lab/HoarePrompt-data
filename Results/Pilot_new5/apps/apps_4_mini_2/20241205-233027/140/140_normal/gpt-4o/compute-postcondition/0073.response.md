Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor` and the previous elements, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors remaining, while `in_degree[neighbor]` is now -1.***
