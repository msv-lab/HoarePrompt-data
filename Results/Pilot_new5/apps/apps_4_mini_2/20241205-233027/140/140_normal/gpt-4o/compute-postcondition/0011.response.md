The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, which reflects an increase in the number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v`. The initial condition specifies that `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges for vertex `v`, and now it will be one more than that. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 vertices, `u` is the second vertex in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 1.**
