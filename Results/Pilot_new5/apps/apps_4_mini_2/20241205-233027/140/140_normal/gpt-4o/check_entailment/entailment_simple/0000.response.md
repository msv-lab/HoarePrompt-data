To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description of making a directed graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then constructs a list of directed edges.

2. **Graph Construction**: 
   - The directed graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex points to a list of vertices it directs to.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function `has_cycle(graph)` is implemented to detect cycles in the directed graph using Kahn's algorithm, which counts the number of nodes processed. If this count is less than `n`, it indicates that a cycle exists in the graph.

4. **Removing Edges**:
   - The program checks if the graph is already acyclic; if so, it returns 'YES'.
   - For each edge, it temporarily removes the edge, checks for cycles, and if the graph becomes acyclic after removing the edge, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no single edge removal can make the graph acyclic, it returns 'NO'.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description

- **Correctness of Logic**: 
   - The program correctly identifies whether removing one edge can result in an acyclic graph. It first checks if the graph is already acyclic, then systematically checks each edge for the potential to create an acyclic graph by its removal.

- **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where:
     - The graph is already acyclic.
     - The graph contains cycles that can be resolved by removing a single edge.
     - The graph cannot be made acyclic by removing any single edge.

- **Return Values**: 
   - The program output matches the required output ('YES' or 'NO'), which corresponds to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Since the program implements the logic required to determine if the directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, and it accurately processes the input and checks for cycles as specified in the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
