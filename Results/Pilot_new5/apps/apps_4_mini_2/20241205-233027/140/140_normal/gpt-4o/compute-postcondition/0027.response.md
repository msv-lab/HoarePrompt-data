The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the new value of `count`.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary; `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`; `count` is 0.**
