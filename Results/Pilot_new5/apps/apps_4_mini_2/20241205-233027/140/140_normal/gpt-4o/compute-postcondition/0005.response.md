The line `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. The initial state specifies that `in_degree[v]` is incremented, meaning that it had some initial value (which is not specified but could be assumed to be non-negative). Other variables such as `graph` and `u` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` must have at least 1 vertex, `u` is the first vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 2 vertices, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1 (making `in_degree[v]` equal to its previous value + 1).

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 vertex, `u` is the first vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 2 vertices, `in_degree[v]` is equal to its previous value + 1.**
