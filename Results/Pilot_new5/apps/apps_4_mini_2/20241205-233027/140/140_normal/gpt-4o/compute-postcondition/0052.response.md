Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1; if `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0, `queue` now contains `neighbor` and `in_degree[v]` remains equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, with `node` corresponding to a vertex in `graph` that has at least 1 neighbor.***
