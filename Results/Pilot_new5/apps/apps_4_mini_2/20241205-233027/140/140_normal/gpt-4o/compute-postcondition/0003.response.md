The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `graph` must have at least 1 vertex, which means `v` is a vertex present in the graph. Therefore, `in_degree[v]` will now reflect one additional incoming edge for vertex `v`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 vertex, `u` is the first vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 1 vertex, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
