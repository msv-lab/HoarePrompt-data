According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and specifically the `node` variable. The loop iterates over the neighbors of the specified `node` in the `graph`. 

For the loop to execute, `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor. Thus, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in the list `graph[node]`. The `visited` and `rec_stack` states are already set correctly for the `node`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are that the `graph` must have at least one neighbor for `node`. 

State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` must have at least one neighbor in graph[node], `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True**
