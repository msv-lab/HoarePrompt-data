Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If there exists at least one neighbor of `node` for which `visited[neighbor]` is False, the function `func_1` returns False for that neighbor, indicating that it either has been visited or does not lead to a cycle. Otherwise, if all neighbors of `node` are visited and their `rec_stack` values are False, it confirms that all paths from `node` lead to nodes that do not create a cycle.***
