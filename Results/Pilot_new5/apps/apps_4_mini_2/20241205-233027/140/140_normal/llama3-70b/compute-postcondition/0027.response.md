The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the directed graph.
- `graph` is a list of lists where each inner list contains the vertices connected by directed edges.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited.
- `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack.

After executing the function body, the function can return the following based on the conditions:

- Case 1: It returns `True`, indicating that the current neighbor has been successfully visited and processed.
- Case 2: It returns `True`, indicating that the node is part of a cycle in the graph, as it has at least one neighbor, and all conditions for visiting and recording the node are satisfied.
- Case 3: It returns `True`, indicating a successful condition as `node` has at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`, and both `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]` are `True`.
- Case 4: It returns `True`, indicating that the node has at least one unvisited neighbor in the graph and is currently marked as visited and part of the recursion stack.
- Case 5: It returns `True`, indicating that the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor in the graph.
- Case 6: It returns `True`, indicating that the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor in the graph.
- Case 7: It returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a vertex `node`, a directed graph represented by `graph`, and tracking lists `visited` and `rec_stack`, and it returns `True` in various conditions related to the processing and visiting of nodes in the graph or returns `False` if none of the successful conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of lists `graph`, a list of boolean values `visited`, and a list of boolean values `rec_stack`. It returns `True` if various conditions related to visiting and processing nodes in the directed graph are satisfied, and returns `False` if none of these conditions are met.**
