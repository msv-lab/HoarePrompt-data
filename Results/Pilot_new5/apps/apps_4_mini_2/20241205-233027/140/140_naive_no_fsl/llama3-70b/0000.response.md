Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, it only checks if there is a cycle in the graph without considering the possibility of removing an edge to break that cycle.

### Case for Incorrectness:

1. Consider the input:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
This graph forms a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1). The correct output should be "YES" because we can remove any one of the edges (for instance, removing the edge 3 -> 1) to make the graph acyclic. 

However, the program checks for cycles using the DFS method without considering edge removal, and it will print "NO" since it detects a cycle exists in the graph without accounting for the option to remove an edge to potentially break the cycle.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description adequately.
