Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically the cases where the input array consists entirely of zeros.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 0 0 0
```

According to the problem description, it is not possible to split an array of zeros into subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum, thus the expected output should be "NO".

However, the program would execute the following logic:
1. It calculates the total sum of the array, which is 0.
2. It then runs a loop to check for non-zero elements. Since all elements are zero, it won't find any and will reach the `else` block.
3. The program will print "NO", which is correct in this case.

But if the input is:
```
3
1 0 -1
```
The program would find that the total sum is 0 and then checks for non-zero elements. It would find the first element (1) is non-zero and would print:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 3
```
This is also a valid output since subarray [1] has sum 1 (non-zero) and subarray [0, -1] has sum -1 (also non-zero).

However, if an input like:
```
3
0 0 0
```
is tested, the program gives "NO", which is incorrect because the problem states if all parts have sum zero, it should print NO which it does correctly.

The issue arises in understanding a case like:
```
2
1 -1
```
This sum is zero and would mistakenly be evaluated incorrectly by the given logic.

So, there are specific cases where the logic fails in more complex arrays that might not be handled appropriately, leading to a mischaracterization of the possible splits.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
