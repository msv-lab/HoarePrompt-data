Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` > `n` remains 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, and `r` takes values from 1 to `n`. The current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and is also not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
