The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` are printed. The variable `k` is incremented by 1, resulting in its value being increased by 1 from its previous state. The variable `l` is equal to `r`, which is equal to `n + 1`, so its value will be `n + 1`. The variable `r` remains unchanged as it is defined as `n + 1`. Therefore, the updated values are: `k` is now `k + 1`, `l` is equal to `n + 1`, and `r` is equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `r` is equal to `n + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1 (now `k + 1`), `l` is equal to `n + 1`**
