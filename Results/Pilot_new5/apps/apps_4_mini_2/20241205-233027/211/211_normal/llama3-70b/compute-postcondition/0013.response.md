The code prints "YES" to the console. No variables are modified or assigned new values; the existing conditions remain valid. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged initial conditions while acknowledging the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for k in [1, n] is equal to the sum of the first k elements of `a`, and `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for k > n remains 0; "YES" is printed.**
