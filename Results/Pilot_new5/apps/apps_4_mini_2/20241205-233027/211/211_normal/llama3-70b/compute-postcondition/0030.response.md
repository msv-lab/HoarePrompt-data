The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`. From the initial state, we know that `r` is equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `l` will also be equal to `n + 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged, while `l` now holds the same value as `r`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `r` is equal to `n + 1`, `k` is now `k + 1`, `l` is equal to `n + 1**.
