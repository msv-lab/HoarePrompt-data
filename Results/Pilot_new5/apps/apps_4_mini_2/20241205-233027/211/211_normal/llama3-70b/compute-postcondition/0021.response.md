Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` > `n` remains 0. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is incremented by 1, `l` is equal to `r`, and the output of the print statement is (1, 1, `r`) where `r` is a specific value from 1 to `n`.***
