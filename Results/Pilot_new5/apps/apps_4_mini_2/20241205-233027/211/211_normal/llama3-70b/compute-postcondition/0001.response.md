The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list that is created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from the user, which is processed as a space-separated string of integers. The variable `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, which indicates the number of integers in the list `A`. The state of the list `A` is updated to reflect the integers entered by the user.

Since `A` consists of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, the value of `a` will become a list of `n` integers based on user input, and the constraints of those integers remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input.**
