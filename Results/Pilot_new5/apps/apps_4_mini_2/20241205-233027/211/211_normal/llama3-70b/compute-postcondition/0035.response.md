The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on two implicit inputs: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `A`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The exact output behavior of the function is not specified, but we can summarize the functionality based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list A of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
