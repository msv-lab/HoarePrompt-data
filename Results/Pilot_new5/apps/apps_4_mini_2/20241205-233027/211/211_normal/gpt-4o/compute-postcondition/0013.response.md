The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the result of `i + 2` and the value of `n`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `i + 2` equals 2. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not stated. Therefore, we can only assert that `n` is some positive integer. 

The values of `total_sum`, `A`, and the printed strings do not change as a result of this code. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0, printed '2', and printed 'n'**.
