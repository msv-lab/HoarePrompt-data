The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. The previous `i` is still 0, `total_sum` is still 0, and `A` remains a list of `n` integers that sum to 0. The printed statements do not affect the state. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
