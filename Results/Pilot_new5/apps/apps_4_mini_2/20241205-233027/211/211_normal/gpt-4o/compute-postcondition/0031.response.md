Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the output is '1', and `n` remains the input positive integer. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, then `A` consists only of zeros, and 'NO' is printed without executing the loop, resulting in `i` being equal to `n`.***
