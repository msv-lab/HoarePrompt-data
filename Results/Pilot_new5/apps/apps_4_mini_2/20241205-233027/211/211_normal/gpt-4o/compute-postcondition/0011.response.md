The code snippet `print('2')` outputs the string '2' to the console. It does not affect the values of any of the variables in the initial state. The variables `n`, `total_sum`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A[0]` is not 0; printed 'YES', and printed '2'.**
