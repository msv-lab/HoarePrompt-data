The code prints the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, 'YES' is printed, '2' is printed, '1 3' is printed**.
