The code `print('2')` outputs the string '2' to the console, but it does not change any of the precondition values. Therefore, the output state remains the same, only noting that '2' has been printed.

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and '2' is printed.**
