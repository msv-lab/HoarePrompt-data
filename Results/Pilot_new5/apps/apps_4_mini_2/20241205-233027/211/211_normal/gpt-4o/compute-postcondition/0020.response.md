The code prints the result of `i + 2` and `n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. Thus, the output will reflect these values.

Calculating:
- `i + 2` results in `1 + 2 = 3`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1 (specific value is unknown).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and '2' is printed, output is '3 n'**.
