Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, then the state remains as `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '+' has been printed, and the conditions remain the same. If `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, then '?' has been printed, while the relationships between `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` still hold true.***
