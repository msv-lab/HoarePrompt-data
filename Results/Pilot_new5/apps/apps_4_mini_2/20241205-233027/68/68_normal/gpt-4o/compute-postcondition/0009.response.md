The code snippet provided simply prints a '+' sign and does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, and the only output is the printed character. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`; '+' has been printed.**
