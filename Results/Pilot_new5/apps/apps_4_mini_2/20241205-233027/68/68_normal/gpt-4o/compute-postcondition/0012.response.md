Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '+' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, and '?' has been printed. Additionally, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, while also satisfying that `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`.***
