Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers x, y, and z (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) via user input. It calculates minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value. **
