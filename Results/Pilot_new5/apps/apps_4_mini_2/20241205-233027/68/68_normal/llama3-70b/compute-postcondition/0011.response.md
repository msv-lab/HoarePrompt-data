The code `print('?')` does not modify any variables but outputs the string `?`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and the state of the program is still defined by the initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and `z` is greater than 0; output is '?'**.
