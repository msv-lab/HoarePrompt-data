The code provided is simply a print statement which outputs a string. It does not affect any of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The output will simply be the printed character `'-'`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. The current value of `x` is less than `y` and `'-'` has been printed.**
