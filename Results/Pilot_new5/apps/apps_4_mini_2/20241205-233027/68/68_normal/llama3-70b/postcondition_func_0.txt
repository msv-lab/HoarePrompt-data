The function accepts no parameters and reads three integers x, y, and z from input, constrained between 0 and 100. It prints '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z; '-' if x is less than y; '0' if x equals y and z is 0; '?' if x equals y and z is greater than 0, or if x is greater than or equal to y but not equal to y. If x is not greater than y + z and does not fall into these specific cases, it defaults to printing '?'.
