To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic it implements against the problem description and evaluate it against potential input cases.

The program reads three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes respectively. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the uncertain votes and determines the result based on the following conditions:

1. If the maximum possible upvotes (including uncertain votes) is less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints '-'.
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (including uncertain votes) is less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+'.
3. In all other cases, it prints '?' indicating that the result is uncertain.

Now, let's analyze the edge cases:

1. **Case (x=0, y=0, z=1)**: 
   - Minimum upvotes = 0, maximum upvotes = 1 (since z=1).
   - Minimum downvotes = 0, maximum downvotes = 1.
   - Here, both maximum upvotes and maximum downvotes equal the minimum downvotes and minimum upvotes respectively, leading to uncertainty. The program outputs '?' which is correct.

2. **Case (x=3, y=7, z=0)**:
   - Minimum upvotes = 3, maximum upvotes = 3.
   - Minimum downvotes = 7, maximum downvotes = 7.
   - The condition checks if max_upvotes < min_downvotes (3 < 7) which is true, so it correctly outputs '-'.

3. **Case (x=2, y=0, z=1)**:
   - Minimum upvotes = 2, maximum upvotes = 3.
   - Minimum downvotes = 0, maximum downvotes = 1.
   - Here, max_downvotes < min_upvotes (1 < 2) is true, so it correctly outputs '+'.

4. **Case (x=1, y=1, z=0)**:
   - Minimum upvotes = 1, maximum upvotes = 1.
   - Minimum downvotes = 1, maximum downvotes = 1.
   - The outputs are equal, so it correctly outputs '0'.

5. **Case (x=0, y=0, z=0)**:
   - Minimum upvotes = 0, maximum upvotes = 0.
   - Minimum downvotes = 0, maximum downvotes = 0.
   - Again, the outputs are equal, resulting in output '0'.

After reviewing the potential cases and considering the logic applied in the program, it appears that all the conditions are correctly implemented according to the problem description. 

Therefore, I cannot identify any case where the program fails to meet the requirements as described.

Correctness: **True**
