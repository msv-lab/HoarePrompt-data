To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles different scenarios regarding the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). 

### Let's break down the logic:

1. **More Upvotes than Downvotes (and unknowns)**: 
   - The condition `if x > y + z:` checks if the upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes plus unknown votes. This correctly identifies cases where upvotes will always be more.
  
2. **More Downvotes than Upvotes**: 
   - The condition `elif x < y:` checks if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes, which correctly identifies cases where downvotes will always be more.
  
3. **Equal Upvotes and Downvotes**: 
   - The condition `elif x == y:` is used to check if the upvotes and downvotes are equal. Inside this block, it correctly checks if there are any unknown voters (`if z == 0:`). If there are none, it outputs "0". If there is at least one unknown voter, it outputs "?" because the outcome can vary depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

4. **Uncertain Result**: 
   - In cases where the above conditions do not apply, it defaults to outputting "?", identifying that the result is uncertain when there are unknown votes and either upvotes or downvotes can dominate.

### Edge Cases:

- **Case 1: x = 0, y = 0, z = 1**: 
  - The program outputs "?" which is correct because the single unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote.
  
- **Case 2: x = 1, y = 1, z = 0**: 
  - The program outputs "0", which is also correct because the votes are equal with no unknowns affecting the result.
  
- **Case 3: x = 3, y = 7, z = 0**: 
  - The program outputs "-", which is accurate as downvotes are more than upvotes.

- **Case 4: x = 2, y = 0, z = 1**: 
  - The program outputs "+", which is correct since even with the unknown vote, upvotes will still be more.

### Conclusion:
After checking these scenarios and conditions, it appears that the program correctly handles all possible inputs according to the problem description. There is no potential case where the logic fails.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**.
