The code snippet provided prints the value of `k + 1` and `1`. Based on the initial state where `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, the output will be a specific integer for `k + 1` and the constant `1`. 

1. The value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, which means `k` can take values from `0` up to `n - 2`.
2. Therefore, `k + 1` will range from `1` to `n - 1`.

The output does not change the state of any variables, but it does print values based on the current value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and the current value of k is less than n - 1; the output is (k + 1, 1).**
