Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1); `remaining_steps` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1); the current value of `full_rows` is an even integer.***
