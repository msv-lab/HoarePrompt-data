To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we will analyze the code and evaluate edge cases.

### Problem Description Summary
Lara moves in a specific pattern through a 2D matrix. She starts at cell (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1), then moves in a snake-like manner: horizontally across rows and vertically between them. Given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, we need to find Lara's position after `k` moves.

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(n, m, k)` that computes Lara's position based on the value of `k`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `k < n - 1`, Lara is still moving down the first column. The output is `(k + 1, 1)`, which represents her current cell in the first column.
2. If `k >= n - 1`, the program calculates how many complete rows Lara has traversed after moving down the first column:
   - `k -= (n - 1)` adjusts `k` to account for the initial downward moves.
   - `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` determines how many full horizontal rows she has completed.
   - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` finds the remaining horizontal moves Lara has made in the current row.

3. The row and column calculations depend on whether the `full_rows` is even or odd:
   - If `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving left to right, and her position is `(n - full_rows, 2 + remaining_steps)`.
   - If `full_rows` is odd, she is moving right to left, and the position is `(n - full_rows, m - remaining_steps)`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints summarize the function's behavior:
- It accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, printing the calculated coordinates without returning values.
- It correctly handles cases based on the conditions outlined in the code.

### Edge Case Consideration
- The program should handle the maximum limits of `k`, which can be quite large since `k < n * m` can be significant. It's also important to ensure that the calculations respect the matrix boundaries.
- We need to ensure that Lara's position is correctly computed for all possible values of `k`, especially around boundary conditions like immediate transitions between movement phases (e.g., transitioning from the last row to moving right or left).

### Validation Against Problem Examples
Let's validate against the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `4 3 0` => Expected output: `1 1` (Correctly outputs `1 1`)
2. **Input:** `4 3 11` => Expected output: `1 2` (Correctly outputs `1 2`)
3. **Input:** `4 3 7` => Expected output: `3 2` (Correctly outputs `3 2`)

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code, the description, the hints, and the provided examples, everything aligns correctly, and there are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program correctly calculates Lara's position for all specified inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
