The variable `col` is assigned the value of `m - remaining_steps`. The values of `m` and `remaining_steps` are both known from the initial state. Since `remaining_steps` is calculated as `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1)`, we can express `col` in terms of `m` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:  
`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1); `remaining_steps` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1); `full_rows` is odd; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` which is an odd integer; `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1); `remaining_steps` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1); `full_rows` is odd; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` which is an odd integer; `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.**
