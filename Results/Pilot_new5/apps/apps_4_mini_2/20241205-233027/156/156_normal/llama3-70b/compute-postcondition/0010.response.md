Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` where `0 ≤ k < n·m`. If `k < n - 1`, the output is `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the output values are `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is not less than `n * 2 - 2`, then `k` is updated to ensure it remains less than `n·m`, greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2.***
