Postcondition: ***`n` is a new even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m` is a new integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. If `k < n * 2 - 2`, the output values are `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated such that `k` remains less than `nÂ·m`, is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and is also greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`.***
