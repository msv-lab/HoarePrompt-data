According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element `v` in `a`, which implies that `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, it is guaranteed that there is at least one element in the list `a` (since n is at least 1). 

At the start of the loop, the first value of `v` will be the first element of the list `a`. As for the values of `px` and `py`, they do not affect the execution of the loop; thus, they can remain as they are.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the relevant states to mention are:
- `a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 1,
- `v` is the first integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers, `v` is the first integer in the list `a`**
