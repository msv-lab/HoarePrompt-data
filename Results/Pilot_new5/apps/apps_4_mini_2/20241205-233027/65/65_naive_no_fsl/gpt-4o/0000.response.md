Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for the scenario where the number of distinct balloon colors exceeds the number of friends. If there are more distinct colors than friends, it is impossible to distribute the balloons without upsetting at least one friend.

For example, consider the input:

```
5 3
abcde
```

In this case, there are 5 distinct colors (a, b, c, d, e) but only 3 friends. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it checks only if the count of each color does not exceed the number of friends, not considering that there are more distinct colors than friends. Therefore, it should output "NO" in this case. 

This reveals a flaw in the logic of the program. Hence, it is incorrect.
