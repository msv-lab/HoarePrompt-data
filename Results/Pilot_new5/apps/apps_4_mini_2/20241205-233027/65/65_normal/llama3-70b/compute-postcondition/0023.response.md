Postcondition: ***`color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the string `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that color in `s`; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer; if `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then the program continues processing without any output. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, the program outputs 'NO'.***
