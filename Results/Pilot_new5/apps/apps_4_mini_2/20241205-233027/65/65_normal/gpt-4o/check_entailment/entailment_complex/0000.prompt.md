You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), k is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique characters in `s` and the values are the counts of each character in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` contains the counts of each unique character in `s`, and `can_distribute` is True if all counts in `color_count` are less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `can_distribute` is False.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` contains the counts of each unique character in `s`. If `can_distribute` is True, the output is 'YES'. If `can_distribute` is False, 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of balloons and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of friends, along with a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters that represent the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color and determines if it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no friend receives more balloons of the same color than `k`. If this distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This function does not return any value, it only outputs results based on the distribution logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
