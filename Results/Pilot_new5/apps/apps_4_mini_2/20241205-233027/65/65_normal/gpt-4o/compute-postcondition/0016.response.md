Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length at least 3, and `color` is the third character in `s`. If `color` is already in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color_count[color]` is set to 1.***
