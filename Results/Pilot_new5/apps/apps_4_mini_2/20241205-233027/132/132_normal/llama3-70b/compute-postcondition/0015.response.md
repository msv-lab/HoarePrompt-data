Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of integers, `x` and `y`, representing the number of stones in corresponding piles during two visits. It checks if the sum of the stones in `x` is equal to the sum of the stones in `y`. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it then checks if the sorted lists `x` and `y` are identical; if they are, it prints 'Yes', otherwise, it prints 'No'. However, if the sums are equal but the lists are not identical, no output is specified, which is a missing functionality in the annotations.**
