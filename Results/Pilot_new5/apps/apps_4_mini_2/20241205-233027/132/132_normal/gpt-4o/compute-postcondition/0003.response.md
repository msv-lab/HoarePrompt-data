The variable `total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `x`. The value of `n` indicates how many elements are in the list `x`, and since each element `x_i` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000, `total_x` will be the sum of `n` such integers. The states of the other variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element x_i satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input; `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`.**
