`x` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where the input is split into individual string components, converted to integers, and collected into a list. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, meaning the length of `x` will be `n`. The elements of `x` will be non-negative integers between 0 and 1000. The state of `n` and `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element x_i satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each element y_i satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000.**
