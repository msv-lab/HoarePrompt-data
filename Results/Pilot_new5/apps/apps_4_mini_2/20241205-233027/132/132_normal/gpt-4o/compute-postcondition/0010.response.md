The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50. The parameter `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000. The parameter `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000. The function processes these inputs and produces a result based on the defined relationships and constraints of the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list x of n non-negative integers, and a list y of n non-negative integers, and processes these inputs to produce an output based on their relationships.**
