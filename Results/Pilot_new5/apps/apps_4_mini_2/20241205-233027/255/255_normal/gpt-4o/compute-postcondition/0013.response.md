Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is the count of transitions between different characters in the string `s` (where a transition is defined as `s[i]` being different from `s[i - 1]`), and `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `operations` remains 1.**
