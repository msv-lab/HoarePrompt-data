Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. 

However, the program instead counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string and uses this count to determine the number of operations. Specifically, the program increments the `operations` counter every time it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. This approach does not accurately reflect the required operations of deleting segments of contiguous equal characters.

For example, consider the input string "aaaaab". The correct number of operations to delete this string should be 1 (removing "aaaaab" in one operation), but the program would return 2, counting the transition from 'a' to 'b'.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect output in certain cases.
