The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `1`. The states of the other variables `n` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is the input value, and 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n`; `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is the input value, and 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n`; `ans` is 1.**
