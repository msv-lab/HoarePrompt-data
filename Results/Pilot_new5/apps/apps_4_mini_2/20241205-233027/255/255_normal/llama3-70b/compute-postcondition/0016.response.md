Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the number of distinct adjacent characters in the string `s` and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to standard output. **
