Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament using the expression `n.bit_length() - 1`. However, this approach does not correctly reflect the tournament's structure and rules.

For example, here's a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input**: 5
  - According to the problem description, the maximum number of games the winner can play should be calculated as follows:
    1. Player 1 can play against Player 2 (1 game),
    2. The winner (Player 1) can then play against the winner of the match between Players 3 and 4 (2 games),
    3. Finally, Player 1 can play against Player 5 (3 games total).
  
  The expected output for this input should be **3**, but the program calculates it as:
  - `5.bit_length()` gives `3`, so `3 - 1` = `2`.

Thus, the program does not account for the possible games correctly and fails to determine the number of games for the input of 5. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description accurately for all cases.
