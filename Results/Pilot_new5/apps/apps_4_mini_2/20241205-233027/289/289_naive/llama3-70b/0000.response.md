Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can participate. The logic behind using `n.bit_length() - 1` is based on the properties of a complete binary tree, which reflects the structure of a knockout tournament.

### Explanation:
1. **Tournament Structure**: In a knockout tournament, the maximum number of matches that can be played is directly related to the height of a complete binary tree that can represent the tournament structure. Each match eliminates one player, and hence the number of games the winner can participate in is equivalent to the height of this tree.

2. **Bit Length**: The bit length of a number `n` gives the position of the highest set bit in its binary representation, which effectively indicates how many times `n` can be halved until it reaches 1 (the root of the binary tree). By subtracting 1, we get the number of edges (or games) leading to that node.

3. **Handling of Inputs**: The function is designed to handle any input within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and will correctly output the number of games for all valid input cases, as demonstrated through the provided examples.

Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly computes the answer for a range of inputs.
