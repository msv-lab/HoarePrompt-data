Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles by buying a combination of Ber-Cola bottles and Bars bars. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It iterates through potential quantities of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) that Vasya can buy, ranging from 0 up to the maximum possible number of bottles he can afford with `n`.
3. For each quantity `x`, it calculates the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola.
4. It checks if the remaining money can be exactly spent on Bars bars by checking if `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. If this condition is met, it calculates the quantity of Bars bars (`y`) that can be bought and prints the result.
5. If the loop finishes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO".

The program covers all possible combinations of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and computes `y` (number of Bars bars) accordingly. Given the constraints (all values being positive integers and within a specified range), the logic is sound, and it handles edge cases where either the bottles or bars can be zero.

All provided examples in the problem statement are addressed correctly by this program, and I cannot think of any additional test case where the program would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
