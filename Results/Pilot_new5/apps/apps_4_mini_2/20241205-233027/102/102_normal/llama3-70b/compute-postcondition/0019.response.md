The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The variable `x` is assigned the value `2`, and `y` is calculated as `(n - 2 * a) // b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `y` is expressed in terms of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`.**
