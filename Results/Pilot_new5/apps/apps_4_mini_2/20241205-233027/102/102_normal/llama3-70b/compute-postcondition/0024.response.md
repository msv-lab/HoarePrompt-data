The function `func` does not accept any parameters, and it operates within the constraints that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. Since the provided output does not specify any cases or return values, we cannot determine the functionality based on the information given. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` remains unspecified as there are no details about its return values or behavior based on the input constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, and its return value is unspecified based on the given information.**
