The code `print(x, y)` will output the current values of `x` and `y`. The values of these variables remain unchanged by the `print` statement; they simply determine what gets printed.

1. `x` is defined as 1.
2. `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000, and `a` is greater than 0.

The other variables listed in the initial state (`a`, `n`, and the printed string 'YES') are unaffected by the execution of the print statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`; the string 'YES' has been printed.**
