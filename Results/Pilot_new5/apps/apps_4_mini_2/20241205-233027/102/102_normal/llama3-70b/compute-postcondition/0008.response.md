The code `exit()` does not change the values of any variables but indicates an exit from the program. Therefore, the states of the variables remain the same, but we acknowledge that the program terminates without further execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b`; the relationship `x * a + y * b` is equal to `n` holds true; printed values are `x` = 0 and `y` = `n // b`; program has exited.**
