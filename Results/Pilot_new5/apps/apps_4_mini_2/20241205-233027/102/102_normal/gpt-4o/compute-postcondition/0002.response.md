The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `a` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the output state indicates the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged while `b` now holds the input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ a â‰¤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer**
