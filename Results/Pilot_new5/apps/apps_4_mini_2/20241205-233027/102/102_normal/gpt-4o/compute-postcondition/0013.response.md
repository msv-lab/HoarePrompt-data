In this code snippet, `print(x, y)` outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `a` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10,000,000\).
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is equal to \((n - a) // b\).
- \((n - a) \% b\) is not equal to 0, meaning \(n - a\) is not divisible by \(b\).
- 'YES' has been printed.

The impact of the `print` statement is simply to output the current values of `x` and `y`. 

Since `x` is explicitly assigned the value of 1, and `y` is defined as \((n - a) // b\), we need to retain these in our output state, while indicating that 'YES' has already been printed but does not affect the variables.

Thus, the Output State is: 
- `x` remains 1,
- `y` is determined by the values of `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to (n - a) // b; 'YES' has been printed.**
