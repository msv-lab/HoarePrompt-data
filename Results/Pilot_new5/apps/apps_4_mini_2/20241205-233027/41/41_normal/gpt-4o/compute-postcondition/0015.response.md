According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. After the last iteration, `_` has been incremented by 1. Since `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001, we know that for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to the current iteration count, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, the next iteration will occur when `_` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop can execute again only if `n` is greater than the current value of `_`.

Given that `n` is still in the range of 3 to 1001, and `_` has been incremented by 1, the state needs to reflect the new value of `_` as `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the tuples (a, b) and the new tuple (a, b) has been appended; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an input integer; and `b` is an input integer; `_` is equal to n**
