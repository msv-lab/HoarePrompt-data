The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input provided, which is converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial conditions state that `is_rated` is True and `is_unrated` is False if `a` is not equal to `b`. Therefore, if `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the tuple (a, b); `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False if `a` is not equal to `b`; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
