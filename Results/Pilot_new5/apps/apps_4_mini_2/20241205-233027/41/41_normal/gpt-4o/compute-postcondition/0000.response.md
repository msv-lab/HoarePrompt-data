The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is an integer between 2 and 1000. The states of the other variables, `a_i` and `b_i`, remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `n` while keeping the conditions for `a_i` and `b_i` intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126; `n` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
