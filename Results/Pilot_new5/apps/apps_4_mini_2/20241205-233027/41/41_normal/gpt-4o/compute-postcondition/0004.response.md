To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop structure. 

1. The variable `n` is given as an integer within the range 2 to 1000, so it is guaranteed to be at least 2. 
2. The `ratings` list is empty before the loop starts, which does not impact the execution of the loop itself since the loop iterates based on `n`, not the content of `ratings`.
3. The flags `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are both set to False, which also does not affect whether the loop will execute.

Since the loop is structured as `for _ in range(n):`, it will execute exactly `n` times regardless of the contents of `ratings` or the boolean states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated`. 

Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied given that `n` is at least 2. The loop will run with `_` taking values from 0 to `n-1`.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False**
