The `ratings` list is updated to include a tuple `(a, b)`, which represents the ratings inputted by the user. The values of `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged since the operation does not affect those variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` contains the tuple (a, b), `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False**
