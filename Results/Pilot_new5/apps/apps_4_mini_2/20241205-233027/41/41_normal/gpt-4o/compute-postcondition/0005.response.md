The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the output of `input()`, which accepts two integers separated by a space and applies `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. The previous states of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the newly assigned values for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
