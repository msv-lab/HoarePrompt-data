According to the code, the loop execution is determined by the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. In the previous iteration, `j` is currently 2, and `n` is at least 3. This means that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and can increment to 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to 3, and `n` must continue to be at least 3. 

Thus, the states that need adjustment are:
- `j` must be updated to 3 for the next iteration, and 
- `n` remains at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
