Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers, `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`, `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0. The current value of `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to the current value of `ratings_after[i]`.***
