Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers. If the integer at index `i` in `ratings_before` is not equal to the integer at index `i` in `ratings_after`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state as there is no else part.***
