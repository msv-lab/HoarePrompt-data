According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i + 1` to `n`. 

1. Since `i` is 2, the range would be from `3` to `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must be at least `3` (which it will be at the start of the loop), and `n` must be greater than `3` to ensure that the range has valid values to iterate over.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute properly, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than `3`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `unrated` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
