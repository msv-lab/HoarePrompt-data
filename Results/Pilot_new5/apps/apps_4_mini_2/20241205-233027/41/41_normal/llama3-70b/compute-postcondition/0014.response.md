In the provided code, `ratings_after` is modified by appending the new value `b` to it. The variable `ratings_before` remains unchanged, and the bounds for `n` do not affect the appending operation. Therefore, the state of `ratings_after` will reflect the inclusion of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` includes `a`; `ratings_after` includes the values previously in it plus `b`.**
