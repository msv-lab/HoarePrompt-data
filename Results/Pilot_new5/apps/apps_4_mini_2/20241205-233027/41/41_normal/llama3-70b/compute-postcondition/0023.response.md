The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers, `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`, `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
