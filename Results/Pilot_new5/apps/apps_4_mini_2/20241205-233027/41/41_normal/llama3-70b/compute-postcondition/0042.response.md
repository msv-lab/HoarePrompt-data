Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If the value of `ratings_before[1]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[2]` and the value of `ratings_after[1]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[2]`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
