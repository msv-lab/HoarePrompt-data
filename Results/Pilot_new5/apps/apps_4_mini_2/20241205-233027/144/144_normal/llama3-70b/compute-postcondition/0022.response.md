The loop iterates through the sorted list `arr` and checks the value of `num` against `mex`. The loop continues until it finds a `num` that is greater than `mex` or it has iterated through all elements in `arr`. If `num` is equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `mex` would represent the smallest positive integer that is not in `arr`. If the loop executes completely through all elements of `arr`, `mex` would equal the length of `arr` plus 1, as all integers from 1 to the length of `arr` would be present in `arr`.

If the loop does not execute (when `arr` is empty), `mex` would remain as it was initialized, which is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a sorted list of integers; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.**
