Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function first reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array, followed by reading the array elements into a list `arr`.

2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted. This is important because it allows for an efficient check of the minimum excluded integer (mex), as we will be comparing consecutive numbers.

3. **Finding mex**: The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest positive integer. The function then iterates through the sorted array `arr`:
   - If the current number (`num`) equals `mex`, it means `mex` is present in the array, and we increment `mex` by 1 to check for the next smallest positive integer.
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, as no further elements can contribute to finding a smaller mex.

4. **Output**: Finally, the current value of `mex` is printed, which represents the maximum possible value of mex for the modified array that Alyona can achieve.

### Why It Works:
- The algorithm effectively finds the lowest positive integer not present in the array, which is exactly what the problem asks for.
- The operations allowed (decreasing elements) ensure that any positive integer that is less than or equal to an element in the array can be obtained. By sorting the array and checking for the smallest missing integer consecutively, the algorithm guarantees that it checks all potential values for mex in an optimal manner.
- The function adheres to the constraints and expected output format, making it a correct solution for the problem.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
