The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` will accept a line of space-separated integers from the user and `map(int, ...)` converts each of these string representations into integers. The list `arr` will thus hold the integers provided in the input.

The previous value of `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. However, the specific values of `a` are not affected by this code snippet, but `arr` will now hold the integers provided by the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
