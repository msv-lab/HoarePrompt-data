The value of `n` is reassigned the value obtained from `int(input())`, which converts the input to an integer. Since `n` is initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), the value of `n` will still satisfy this condition, but the exact value will change based on the user input. The list `a` of `n` positive integers remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `n` is now equal to the input integer.**
