The function `func` accepts input from the user in the form of a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of integers to follow, and then a list `arr` of `n` positive integers. The function processes this list to determine the smallest positive integer (referred to as `mex`) that is not present in the sorted list `arr`. It starts searching from the integer 1 and increments the `mex` value whenever it finds the current `mex` in the list. If it encounters a number greater than the current `mex`, it stops searching. The final value of `mex` is then printed.

The function does not handle cases where the input is incorrectly formatted or where the numbers are outside the specified range. It assumes that the input will always be valid according to the preconditions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, determines the smallest positive integer not present in the list, and prints this value. **
