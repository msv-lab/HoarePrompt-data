Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which is guaranteed to be in the range [1, 100,000], and then reads an array of integers `arr`, where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array `arr`. Sorting is necessary to effectively determine the maximum possible mex since we want to check for the presence of consecutive integers starting from 1.

3. **Mex Calculation**: The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, representing the smallest positive integer. The program iterates through the sorted array:
   - If the current number `num` equals `mex`, it means `mex` is present in the array, so `mex` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, as no further relevant elements can affect the value of `mex`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the array after applying the rules outlined in the problem description. The condition `1 ≤ b[i] ≤ a[i]` is naturally handled since `mex` will only count up to the largest `a[i]` in cases where the sorted array has all integers from 1 up to some maximum.

5. **Correctness Across Cases**: The implementation correctly handles edge cases, including:
   - Situations where no numbers need to be decreased (e.g., in the second example).
   - Cases with duplicates or very high values in `arr`.

Thus, the program adheres fully to the requirements outlined in the problem description, ensuring that it computes the maximum possible mex correctly for all potential inputs within the specified ranges.
