The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element than the current `num`; `num` is the next integer in `arr`; `mex` is unchanged or incremented by 1 if `num` is equal to the previous `mex` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
