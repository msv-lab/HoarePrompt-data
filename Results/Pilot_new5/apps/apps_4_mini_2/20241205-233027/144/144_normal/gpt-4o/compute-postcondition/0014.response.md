Initial State: `n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `mex` is 1.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is the first element in `a`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex + 1`, then `mex` increments to 2.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `num` is the second element in `a`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` increments to 3.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in `a`; if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` increments to 4.

Final Output State: If the loop executes for all `n` elements in `a`, `mex` will be equal to the smallest integer greater than all elements in `a`, which is `max(a) + 1`. If the loop does not execute, `mex` remains 1 and all values in `a` are positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`mex` is equal to the smallest integer greater than the maximum element in `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order.**
