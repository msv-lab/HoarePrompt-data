The variable `mex` is initialized to the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer ranging from `1` to `100,000`, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The initialization of `mex` does not depend on any of the previous values, and thus affects only the value of `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `mex` is 1.**
