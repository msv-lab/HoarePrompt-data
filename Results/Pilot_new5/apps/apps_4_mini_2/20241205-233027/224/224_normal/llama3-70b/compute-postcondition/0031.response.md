The value of `dp[j]` is updated using the modulus operation with `MOD`. Since `j` is 1, the operation performed is `dp[1] %= MOD`. The previous value of `dp[1]` is unknown but will be affected by the modulus operation. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`.**
