According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1, decrementing `j` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, meaning the loop executed with `j` taking the value of 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented to 1. Additionally, since `f_max_n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to have been valid in the previous iteration, it will remain unchanged.

State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`**
