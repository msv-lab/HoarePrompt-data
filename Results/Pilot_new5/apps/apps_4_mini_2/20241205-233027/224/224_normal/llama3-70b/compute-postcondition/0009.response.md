The statement `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
