The value of `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`. The variable `dp[j]` changes, but the specific values of `dp[j]` and `MOD` are not provided, so we cannot determine its exact outcome. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD.**
