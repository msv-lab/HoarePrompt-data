The line of code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. In the initial state, `j` is 1, which means we are accessing `dp[1]` and adding the value of `dp[0]` to it. The specific values of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` are not provided, but we know that `j` is being used to reference elements in the `dp` array.

Given that `j` is now 1, the value of `dp[1]` will be updated. The previous values of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` are unknown, but the operation will affect `dp[1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD, dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] + dp[0]`.**
