The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. In this case, the variable `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 2`, which means that the value of `dp[j]` will be modified based on the current values of the `dp` array.

Assuming `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are initialized and have valid values, after this operation:
- `dp[j]` will be increased by the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

The other variables such as `n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state should reflect that `dp[j]` is now updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD.**
