The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` means that the value of `dp[j]` will be updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. The variable `j` is initialized to `1`, so we are specifically updating `dp[1]` with this operation. The previous state of `dp[1]` is not provided, but it will be affected by this operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD, dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD.`**
