To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The output description confirms this functionality.
   
2. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
   - This function is intended to compute `f_max(n)` where `f_max(n)` indicates the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers from 1 to `n`. The function initializes `res` to 0 and iterates from 1 to `n`, updating `res` with the maximum GCD calculated with the current index. However, it does not compute `f(p)` correctly related to the permutations, as the GCD values computed do not account for distinct prefixes adequately.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**
   - This function utilizes dynamic programming to count permutations. However, it initializes `dp` at index 0, which means it does not account for permutations correctly when `f_max_n` is 0 (though the function suggests it won't be 0). The use of `dp` for counting combinations appears suspicious, as it seems to misrepresent the count of distinct permutations that yield a certain `f_max_n`.

### Output Hints Confirmation

- The output hints for each function agree with their respective implementation.
- The hints for `func_1` are accurate, confirming it computes the GCD.
- The hints for `func_2` claim it finds a maximum GCD value, but it doesn't cover the logic needed to evaluate permutations as intended.
- The hints for `func_3` suggest it handles combinations but fail to mention insufficient handling of the `f_max_n` cases. Specifically, it does not address scenarios where `f_max_n` could be 0 or how it might affect counting permutations.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

1. **For `func_2(n)`**: The logic to return the maximum doesn't correctly represent the distinct GCDs from permutations. For example, when `n = 3`, it must distinctly count contributions to `f(p)` from permutations, which it fails to do.
   
2. **For `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: If `f_max_n` is incorrectly calculated and it is possible to have 0, the function will not return correct results since it initializes `dp[0]` but does not handle cases where it influences the counting of permutations. 

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to evaluate the `f(p)` function for permutations of integers from `1` to `n`. This is confirmed by the function descriptions and output hints, which indicate that edge cases and permutations haven't been fully accounted for. Since the functionality does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the logic for permutations yielding distinct GCDs accurately, especially for the calculations in `func_2` and `func_3`.
