To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the specified problem description and annotations, we need to analyze the functions and their logic closely.

### Problem Description Summary
The task requires counting the number of permutations of integers from 1 to n where the function f(p) reaches its maximum value f_max(n). 

1. **f(p)** is defined by the number of distinct GCDs from prefixes of p.
2. **f_max(n)** is the maximum value of f(p) across all permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].
3. The output should be the count of permutations p such that f(p) = f_max(n) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis

1. **func_1**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers a and b. The GCD is well-defined even if one or both integers are zero, as per standard mathematical convention.

2. **func_2**:
   - This function iterates through numbers 1 to n and computes the maximum GCD among the prefixes of permutations. However, it merely returns the maximum GCD without identifying or accounting for how many permutations lead to that maximum GCD value. This is a key issue, as the problem specifically asks for the count of permutations with f(p) equal to f_max(n).

3. **func_3**:
   - This function attempts to compute the number of permutations that have a specific property based on a dynamic programming approach. However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to count permutations with f(p) equal to f_max(n). The output depends on the logic of combinations rather than directly counting the valid permutations. 

### Inference from Annotations
The annotations suggest that func_2 returns a maximum GCD but does not correlate directly to the count of permutations that yield this maximum value. In particular, func_3 does not properly account for or restrict its calculations to valid permutations of p that achieve f(p) = f_max(n).

### Edge Cases
The problem description includes cases where n equals 2, 3, and 6, with expected outputs. The provided functions do not explicitly check or calculate permutations for every possible input value of n, and the logic does not guarantee that all edge cases are considered.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to correctly count the number of permutations that yield the maximum value of f(p). 

Thus, the final evaluation is that the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
