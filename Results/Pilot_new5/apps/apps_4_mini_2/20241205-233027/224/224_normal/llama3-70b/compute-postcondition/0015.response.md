According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute if `f_max_n` is at least 1, as the range function is defined as `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`, which generates numbers from `f_max_n` down to 1. Given that `f_max_n` must be at least 2 according to the state, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `j` will start at `f_max_n` and will represent the current value during each iteration. 

Since `f_max_n` is at least 2, the initial value for `j` will be 2. Therefore, the state can be defined as follows:

State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
