According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `f_max_n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. 

Since the loop decreases `j` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `f_max_n - 1` at the start of the last iteration, which means it will become `f_max_n - 2` for the next iteration. Additionally, `f_max_n` must be at least 1 for the loop to have a valid range of values to iterate over.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to have `j` as `f_max_n - 2`, and `f_max_n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
