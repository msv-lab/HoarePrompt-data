The variable `result` is assigned the value `result * i % mod`. The initial value of `result` is 1 and the value of `i` is 2. However, the variable `mod` has not been defined in the initial state and is considered an external variable, assuming it is a positive integer to avoid issues.

Calculating the result:
- If we denote `mod` as a positive integer, then `result * i` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.
- Thus, `result` will be updated to `2 % mod`. Since `mod` is a positive integer, `result` will still be `2` if `mod > 2` or equal to `2` if `mod <= 2`.

The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
