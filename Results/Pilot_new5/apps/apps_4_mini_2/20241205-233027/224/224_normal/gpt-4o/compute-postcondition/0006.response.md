The statement `result = result * i % mod` updates the value of `result` based on its current value, the value of `i`, and the variable `mod`. 

1. The initial value of `result` is `6 % mod`.
2. The value of `i` is `4`.
3. The operation performed is a multiplication followed by a modulus operation.

Therefore, after the operation, `result` will be updated to `(6 % mod) * 4 % mod`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so we will keep `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and `i` is still equal to 4.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `result` is equal to `(6 % mod) * 4 % mod`; `i` is 4.**
