The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i and h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, with constraints that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000. The function processes this input and generates an output based on the characteristics of the cakes. 

Given these parameters, the functionality of the function is to receive the number of cakes and their respective dimensions, and subsequently return a result based on these dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n representing the number of cakes and a list of tuples cakes where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of each cake.**
