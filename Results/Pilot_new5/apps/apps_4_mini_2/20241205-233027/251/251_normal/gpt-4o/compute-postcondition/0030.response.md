According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is 3, the loop will iterate from 0 to 2 (a total of 3 iterations). The variable `j` will take values 0, 1, and 2 during the loop execution. 

The states provided before the loop state that `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, which satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute. Also, `i` is set to 3, which is the correct value for the loop's range.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is still 3 and `j` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**
