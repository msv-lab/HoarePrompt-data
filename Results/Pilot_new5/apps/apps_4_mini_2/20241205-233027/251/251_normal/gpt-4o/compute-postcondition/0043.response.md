The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of cakes, constrained by the condition (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). The parameter `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, with each r_i and h_i satisfying the constraints (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000). After executing the function, it returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which represents the maximum volume sum of cakes whose volumes are less than each corresponding volume in the `volumes` list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes, and returns the maximum volume sum of cakes whose volumes are less than each corresponding volume in the volumes list.**
