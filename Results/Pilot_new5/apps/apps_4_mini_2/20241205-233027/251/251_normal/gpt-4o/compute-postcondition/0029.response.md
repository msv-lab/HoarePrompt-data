The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the value `volumes[i]`. The previous state indicates that `dp[i]` was calculated based on the maximum values of `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for `j` in the range from 0 to 2, where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[3]`. However, this calculation is overridden by the direct assignment of `volumes[i]` to `dp[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and the other `dp` values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and must be greater than 3; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `dp[i]` is now equal to `volumes[i]`.**
