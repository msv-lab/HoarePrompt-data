The values of `r` and `h` are assigned based on the input received from the user using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `r` and `h` will now hold the values provided as input integers, while `n` remains unchanged within its range of 1 to 99,999, and `cakes` still holds the previously calculated entry `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 99,999; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer; `cakes` remains unchanged with an entry (math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)**
