The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`. Since `i` is currently 1, `dp[1]` will be equal to `cakes[1][0]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `dp[0]` remain unchanged, and the condition that `cakes` must have at least `n` elements ensures that `cakes[1][0]` is valid.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements**
