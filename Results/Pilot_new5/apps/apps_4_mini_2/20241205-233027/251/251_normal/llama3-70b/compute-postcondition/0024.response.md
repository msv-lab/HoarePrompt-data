According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment to 1. Given that `i` must be at least 2, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

Thus, after the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and since `i` remains at least 2, the loop is still valid. The states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[1][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[1][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[0] + cakes[i][0]`.**
