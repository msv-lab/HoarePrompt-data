The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius and height of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake, sorts the cakes in descending order by volume, and then computes the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked based on the condition that a cake can only be stacked on top of another if it is smaller in both radius and height. Finally, it prints the maximum sum of volumes of the stackable cakes.
