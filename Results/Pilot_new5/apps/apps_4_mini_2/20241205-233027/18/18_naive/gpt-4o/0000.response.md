To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem describes a Mexican wave scenario where:
- At time `t` from `1` to `k`, the number of standing spectators equals `t`.
- From time `k + 1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators is constant and equals `k`.
- After `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases back to `0` as spectators sit down, with the count being `n + k - t`.

### Program Logic
The program has the following structure:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)
```

#### Breakdown of Conditions:
1. **Condition `if t <= k:`** 
   - For times `1` to `k`, it correctly prints `t` (the number of standing spectators).
   
2. **Condition `elif t <= n:`** 
   - For times `k + 1` to `n`, it correctly prints `k` (the constant number of standing spectators).
   
3. **Condition `else:`** 
   - For times `n + 1` to `n + k`, it uses the formula `n + k - t`, which accounts for the decreasing number of standing spectators as they sit down.

### Testing Edge Cases
To ensure the correctness, we must consider edge cases not detailed in the sample inputs:
- **Minimum Input Values:** For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `t = 1`, it should output `1` (correct).
- **Maximum Values for `n` and `k`:** For `n = 10^9`, `k = 10^9`, `t = 10^9`, it should output `0` (correct).
- **Boundary Conditions:** For `t = k + 1`, `t = n + 1`, and `t = n + k`, the output should remain consistent with the problem description.

### Checking a Failing Case
However, let's examine the edge case where `t = n + k - 1`. 

If `t` is `n + k - 1`, then according to the logic:
- The `else` condition will activate, resulting in `n + k - (n + k - 1) = 1`.

However, we need to ensure that this matches the problem description. If `t` exceeds `n` but is less than `n + k`, it should still follow the seating rules and yield the correct number of standing spectators. The output in this case should remain consistent with the decrementing wave logic, and should be tested against specific values.

Given that the decrement at time `n + k - 1` means that we would expect `n + k - 1` to yield `2` spectators, not `1`.

### Conclusion
The program has an issue in the handling of the decrementing logic for when `t` is `n + k - 1`. This means it does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
