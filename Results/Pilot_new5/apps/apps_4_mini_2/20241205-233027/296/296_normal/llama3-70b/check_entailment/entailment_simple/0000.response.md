Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Handling of n = 2**: The program correctly identifies that for `n = 2`, the output should be "NO". This part is correct.

2. **Handling of n > 2**: For values of `n` greater than 2, the program outputs "YES", and then it prints `k = 2`, followed by the fractions `1` and `n // 2`, and `1` and `n`. This is incorrect for several reasons:
   - The fractions generated do not satisfy the condition that `b_i` should divide `n` for `i = 1 \ldots k`. Specifically, while `n` itself may not be a valid fraction (since `b_i` must be less than `n`), the value `n // 2` is not guaranteed to divide `n` for all cases (e.g., if `n` is odd).
   - The requirement to sum the fractions to equal `1 - 1/n` is not satisfied in the program's output. For example, if `n = 6`, the output given is `1/3 + 1/6` which does not equal `1 - 1/6`.

3. **General Case**: The structure of the output fractions does not correctly adhere to the constraints of the problem, particularly with respect to what values of `b_i` can be and how many fractions are needed to reach the sum of `1 - 1/n`.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the criteria of the problem description for all cases where `n > 2`, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
