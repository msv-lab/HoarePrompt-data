The variable `k` is assigned the value `2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The conditions on `n` (that it is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is not equal to 2) remain valid as well.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is not equal to 2; `k` is 2**
