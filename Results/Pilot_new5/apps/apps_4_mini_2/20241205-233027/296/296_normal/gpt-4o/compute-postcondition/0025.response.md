The variable `k` is assigned the value of the length of the list `divisors`. Since `divisors` is not an empty list and contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, the value of `k` will be a positive integer representing the number of such divisors. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9; `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`; `k` is a positive integer equal to `len(divisors)`.**
