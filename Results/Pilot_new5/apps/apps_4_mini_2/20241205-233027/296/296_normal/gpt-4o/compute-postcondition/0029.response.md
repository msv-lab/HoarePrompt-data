Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^9`) and returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or if `n` is a prime number (indicating that there are no divisors other than 1 and itself). If `n` is not prime, it returns 'YES', followed by the count of divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself`), and a list of fractions in the form (1, d) for each divisor `d` found. **
