The code appends the result of the expression `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, and `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, we can determine the value to be appended. The value of `n // i` is the integer division of `n` by `i`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1; `divisors` includes the previous values and also includes the value `n // i`.**
