The code adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The variable `i` is currently equal to 3, and `divisors` will now include this value. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `divisors` now includes the value 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `divisors` now includes the value 3.**
