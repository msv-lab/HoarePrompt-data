According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2 and continues until `i` exceeds `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, and since `n` is greater than 4, we know `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2. The range for `i` is from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which means the loop can execute for each integer value of `i` starting from 2 up to the integer square root of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. After the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. 

Therefore, we adjust `i` to be the next integer value and ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Given that `n` is greater than 4, we can conclude that `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 2, which means `i` can take on values up to the integer square root of `n`. 

If `i` was at its maximum valid value before the end of the last iteration, it would now be equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. For the loop to execute once more, we need `i` to be incremented by 1, which implies that `i` now would equal `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which means `i` should be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1; if `n` is divisible by 3, then `divisors` includes the value 3 and, if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, it also includes the value `n // 3`**
