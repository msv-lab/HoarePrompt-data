The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the result of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `i` is not equal to `n // i`. 

Since `i` is 2, we can evaluate:

- The value of `n // i` will be `n // 2`, which will be an integer result of dividing `n` by 2.
- The list `divisors` will now include this new value.

Given that `i` is 2, and it is mentioned that `i != n // i`, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 4 (since if `n` were to be 4, `n // i` would equal `i`, which contradicts the precondition).

Therefore, we can express the updated state for `divisors`:

- The `divisors` list will now contain the original value (which is 2) plus the new value `n // 2`.

The output state will therefore summarize the changes:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is greater than 4; `divisors` is a list containing 2 and `n // 2`; `i` is 2; the current value of `i` is not equal to `n // i`.**
