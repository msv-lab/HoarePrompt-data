To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider the given conditions and how the loop operates.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\).
- `i` is less than \(n - 2\), which implies \(i + 2 < n\).
- `j` is 2.
- `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least \(i + 1\).

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
```

In this loop, `j` starts at `i + 2` and continues until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Currently, `j` is 2, which means:
- The next value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j = 3` (since `j` will be incremented by 1).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- We need to ensure that `j` (which will be 3 at the next iteration) is still less than `n`. Given that \(i < n - 2\), we can deduce that \(n\) must be at least 4 so that `j` can increment to 3 and still be less than `n`.

So, we adjust the states accordingly:
- `j` will be 3 after the next iteration starts.
- Since there is no additional modification required for `s` or `i` based on the current information, the string `s` will still have to maintain its property (as described).

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is 3, and `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`**.
