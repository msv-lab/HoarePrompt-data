Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]` are 'G'. `beauty` is equal to the count of 'G' characters from `s[0]` to the last index of `s` that was 'G' before encountering a character that is not 'G' or reaching the end of the string. `j` is the index at which the loop stopped executing, which is at least `i + 2` and less than `n`. If the loop executed, `j` will be the index of the first character that is not 'G' or `n` if all characters from `s[i + 2]` to `s[n - 1]` are 'G'.**
