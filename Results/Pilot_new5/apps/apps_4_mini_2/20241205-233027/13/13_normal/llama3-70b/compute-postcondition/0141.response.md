To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we start with the understanding of the loop's structure and the initial conditions provided.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is at least `i + 2`
- `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'
- `beauty` is 1

The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to 0, checking the characters in the string `s`. The output state after the loop executes depends on how many consecutive 'G' characters are found starting from `s[i - 1]` downwards to `s[0]`.

1. **If the loop executes 0 times**: This means `i` is 1 or less (but since `i` must be at least 1 as stated), the loop does not execute at all. In this case, `beauty` remains 1.

2. **If the loop executes 1 time**: For this to happen, `i` must be at least 1. `j` will be `i - 1`. If `s[j]` (which is `s[i - 1]`) is 'G', `beauty` becomes 2. If it is not 'G', `beauty` remains 1.

3. **If the loop executes 2 times**: For this case, `i` must be at least 2. The character at `s[j]` (which is `s[i - 1]`) is 'G', so `beauty` is updated to 2, and then `j` decreases to `i - 2`. If `s[j]` (which is now `s[i - 2]`) is also 'G', `beauty` becomes 3. If not, it remains 2.

4. **If the loop executes 3 times or more**: This requires `i` to be at least 3. The process continues with checking characters from `s[i - 1]`, `s[i - 2]`, and `s[i - 3]`, incrementing the `beauty` for each 'G' character found. The loop will stop at the first character that is not 'G'.

Given that all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', we deduce that after the loop executes as many times as possible, the total `beauty` will equal the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `s[i]` downwards. Since all characters from index 0 to `i` are 'G', the maximum `beauty` ends up being `i + 1` (the initial value of `beauty` being 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's).

Therefore, after the loop has executed fully, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 0, `j` is -1, `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`, `beauty` is `i + 1`**.
