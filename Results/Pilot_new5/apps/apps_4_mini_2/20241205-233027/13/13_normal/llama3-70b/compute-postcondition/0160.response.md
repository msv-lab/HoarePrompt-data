The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. The values of these two variables are not modified by this code execution; rather, it simply evaluates and returns the maximum of the two.

Since the initial state does not explicitly give values for `max_beauty` or `max_beauty_one_swap`, we can only state that the output will be the maximum of these two variables.

The output state will thus reflect the unchanged conditions and indicate that the maximum of the two values has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable with one swap, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[n - 1]` have been evaluated, and the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` has been printed.**
