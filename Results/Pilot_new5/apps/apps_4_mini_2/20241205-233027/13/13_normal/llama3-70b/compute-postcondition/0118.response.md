According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` in relation to `n`. The variable `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 2`, so `j` is `i + 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, which means `j` will now be `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which implies that `i + 3` must be less than `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute once more, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`**
