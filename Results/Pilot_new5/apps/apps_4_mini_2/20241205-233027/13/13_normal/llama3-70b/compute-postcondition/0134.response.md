The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `beauty` can either start at 1 or 2 depending on the condition involving the character at `s[j]`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` will be updated to 2, and if it is not 'G', `beauty` remains 1. Since the code snippet does not specify the initial value of `beauty`, we assume it starts at 1 and is incremented.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `beauty` is now 2 since the only way for it to stay at 1 is when `s[j]` is not 'G'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and `beauty` is 2.**
