According to the code, the for loop iterates with the variable `j` starting from `i - 1` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, and since the loop decrements `j`, it will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. 

Given that `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, in the previous iteration, `j` would have been decremented to 0 after the last execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to -1 (which is below the minimum value for the loop to continue) in the next iteration.

However, since the loop will exit when `j` is less than 0, we need to ensure that on the next iteration, `j` should still be able to execute the loop body for the next decrement. Thus, we need to update `j` to be `i - 2` in order for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to `i - 2`**
