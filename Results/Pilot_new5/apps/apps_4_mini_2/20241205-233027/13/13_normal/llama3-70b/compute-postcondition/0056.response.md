According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate from `0` to `n-2` (since the range is `n - 1`). For this loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2` (which is already ensured by the given state that `n` is between `2` and `100000`). 

The loop variable `i` will start at `0`, and since the loop iterates until `n - 2`, it will execute for indices `0` to `n - 2`. There are no specific requirements for `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, or `max_beauty_one_swap` affecting the execution of the loop, as the loop only depends on the value of `n`.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` is initialized to `0`.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `n` is valid (which it already is in the given state).
- `i` is initialized to `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0**.
