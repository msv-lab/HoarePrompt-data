According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`, as well as the condition that `s[left]` must not be 'G'. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `left` is `left + 1` (meaning it has already been incremented by 1),
- `right` is greater than 0,
- and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be satisfied:
1. `left` must still be less than `right`.
2. `s[left]` must still not be equal to 'G'.

Since `left` has already been incremented by 1, we should ensure that it remains less than `right` after this increment. Therefore, `right` must be greater than `left` (the incremented value). 

We don't need to change the condition on `s[left]`, but we need to clarify that `s[left]` must not be 'G' for the new `left`.

To summarize, we need to ensure that `right` is greater than the new value of `left`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` must be greater than `left`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
