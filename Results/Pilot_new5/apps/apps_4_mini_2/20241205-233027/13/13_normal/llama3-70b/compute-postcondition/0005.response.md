The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is an input string; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 0.
