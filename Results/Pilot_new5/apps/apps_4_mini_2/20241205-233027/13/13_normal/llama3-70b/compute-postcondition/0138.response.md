`beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 3, `j` is `i - 3`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and `beauty` is increased by 1.
