The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G's that can be obtained by evaluating the string and potentially swapping one 'S' next to a 'G'. Finally, it prints the maximum beauty value, which is either the maximum count of consecutive 'G's without any swap or the maximum count obtainable with one swap. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result.
