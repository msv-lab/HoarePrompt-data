In the provided code, the variable `max_beauty` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. The initial state indicates that `max_beauty` is `0`, and `curr_beauty` is also `0`. Therefore, after executing the statement, `max_beauty` remains `0`, as `max(0, 0)` equals `0`. The remaining variables are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `s[right]` is not equal to 'G'.**
