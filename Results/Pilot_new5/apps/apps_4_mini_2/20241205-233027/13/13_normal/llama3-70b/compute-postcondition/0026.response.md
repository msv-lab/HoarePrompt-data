The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so the output state includes the unchanged variables along with the updated value for `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`; `right` is `n`; `left` remains 0 or the first index of 'G' in `s` (if applicable); `curr_beauty` is 0.**
