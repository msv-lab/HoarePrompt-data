The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `beauty` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
