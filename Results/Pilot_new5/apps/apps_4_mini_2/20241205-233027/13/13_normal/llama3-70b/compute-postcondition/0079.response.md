Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]` are 'G'. If the character at index `j` (where `j` is `i + 2`) in `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is equal to the count of 'G' characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` plus 1. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', `beauty` remains the count of 'G' characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
