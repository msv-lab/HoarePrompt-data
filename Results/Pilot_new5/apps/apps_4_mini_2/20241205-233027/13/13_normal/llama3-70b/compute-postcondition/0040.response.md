The value of `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `curr_beauty`. The initial state indicates that `max_beauty` is 0, so after executing the code, `max_beauty` will be adjusted based on the current value of `curr_beauty`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, `right` is incremented by 1, and `curr_beauty` is adjusted based on `s[right]`.**
