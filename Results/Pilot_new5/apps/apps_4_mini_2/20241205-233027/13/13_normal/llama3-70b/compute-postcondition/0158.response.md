Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is calculated as `i + 1` plus the count of consecutive 'G's in `s` starting from index `i + 2` up to but not including `n`, stopping at the first non-'G' character or at index `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
