Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is less than `n - 2`; `j` is at least `i + 2` after the loop finishes; `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` plus the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i + 2]` to the last 'G' character before a non-'G' character is encountered; `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
