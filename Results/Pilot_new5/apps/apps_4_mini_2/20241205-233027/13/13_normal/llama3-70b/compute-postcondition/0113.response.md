Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'. If the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` (inclusive) plus 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, `beauty` remains equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` (inclusive), and `s[j]` is not 'G', resulting in breaking out of the most internal loop.***
