The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. This does not change its initial value, which is already `0`. The other variables remain unaffected, and their initial states do not change. Therefore, the Output State is that all initial variables remain as they were, with `curr_beauty` still being 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `s[right]` is not equal to 'G'.**
