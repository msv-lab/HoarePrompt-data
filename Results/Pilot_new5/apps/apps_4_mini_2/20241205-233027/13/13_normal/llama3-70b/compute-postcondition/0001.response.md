The variable `s` is assigned the value from `input()`, which is a string entered by the user. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged state of `n` and the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is an input string.**
