The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 0, so the new value of `left` is 1. The conditions for `n` and the requirement that `s[left]` must not be 'G' remain unchanged, but we now have a specific value for `left`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `left` is 1, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `left` is 1, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**.
