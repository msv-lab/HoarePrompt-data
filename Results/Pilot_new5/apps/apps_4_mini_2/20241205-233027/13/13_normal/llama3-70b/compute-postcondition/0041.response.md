The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value of 0. The values of the other variables such as `n`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `right` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only affects `curr_beauty`. Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions of those variables while updating `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, `right` is incremented by 1, and `curr_beauty` is 0.**
