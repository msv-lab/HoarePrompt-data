The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `current value of trophies[i]` must be 'G', `start` is 0.
