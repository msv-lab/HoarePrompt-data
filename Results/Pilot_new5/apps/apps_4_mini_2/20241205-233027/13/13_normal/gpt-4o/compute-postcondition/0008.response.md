The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after the operation, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `current value of trophies[i]` must be 'G', `start` is 0**
