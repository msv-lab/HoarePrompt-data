The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\), and `trophies` is a string of length \(n\) consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'. 

After executing the function body:
- If there are no 'G's in the `trophies`, the function returns 0, indicating that there are no segments of 'G's.
- If there is exactly one segment of contiguous 'G's, the function returns the maximum length of that segment.
- If there are multiple segments of contiguous 'G's, the function returns the minimum value between the maximum length of segments plus 1 and `n`, where the maximum length considers gaps of 2 between the segments.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and based on the arrangement and continuity of 'G's in `trophies`, it returns either 0, the length of the longest segment of contiguous 'G's, or a calculated minimum length based on the gaps between segments. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, returns 0 if there are no 'G's, returns the maximum length of a segment of contiguous 'G's if there is one segment, or returns the minimum value between the maximum length of segments plus 1 and `n` if there are multiple segments.**
