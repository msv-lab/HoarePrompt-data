The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previously defined state indicates that `i` was initially 0, so after this operation, `i` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `current value of trophies[i]` is 'S', `start` is 0**
