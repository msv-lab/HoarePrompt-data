The code assigns the values from the `segments` list at index `i` to the variables `curr_start` and `curr_end`. This means that `curr_start` takes the first element of the tuple at `segments[i]`, and `curr_end` takes the second element of that same tuple. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing segments of 'G's, `max_length` is the maximum length of segments of contiguous 'G's, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i]`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i]`.**
