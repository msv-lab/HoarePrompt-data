The code assigns the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` from the `segments` list at the index `i - 1`, which is `1` since `i` is `2`. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` will now hold the values of the segment at index `1` of the `segments` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2; `prev_start` is now set to `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is now set to `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` remains unchanged, `curr_end` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `len(segments)` must be greater than 2.**
