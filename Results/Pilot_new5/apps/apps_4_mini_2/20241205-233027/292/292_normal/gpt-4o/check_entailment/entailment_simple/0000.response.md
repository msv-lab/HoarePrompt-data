Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program accurately addresses the problem description by correctly simulating the weight gain of Limak and Bob over the years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. This matches the problem's input format.

2. **Weight Growth Simulation**: The program uses a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). In each iteration:
   - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   This accurately reflects the growth rates specified in the problem description.

3. **Year Count**: The variable `years` is incremented in each iteration of the loop, keeping track of the number of years that have passed until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

4. **Output**: Once Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight, the number of years is printed, which corresponds to the expected output of the problem description.

The loop will execute at least once, ensuring that if Limak starts at the same weight as Bob, he will become strictly heavier after the first year due to his weight tripling compared to Bob's weight doubling. 

Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always terminate, as Limak's weight will eventually exceed Bob's weight after a certain number of iterations.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, making it accurate and complete for all valid inputs specified in the problem description.
