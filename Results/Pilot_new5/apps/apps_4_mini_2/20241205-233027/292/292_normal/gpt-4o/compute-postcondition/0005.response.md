The impact of the code on the program is that the variable `years` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `years` is 0, so after the increment, `years` becomes 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 20, `a` is now 3 times its original value, `years` is 1**.
