The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Since it is stated that `b` is greater than its previous value doubled, this means that the new value of `b` will definitely satisfy the condition of being at least equal to `a`, given the initial conditions. 

The initial state indicates:
- `a` is an integer equal to its previous value multiplied by 9 (which implies `a` is a multiple of 9).
- `b` is greater than its previous value doubled, which means the previous value of `b` was already quite large.
- `years` is 2 (this variable is not affected by the code).

After executing `b *= 2`, we know that `b` will now be greater than its previous value doubled. Therefore, the value of `b` will certainly remain greater than or equal to `a` based on the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to its previous value multiplied by 9; `b` is greater than the previous value doubled; `years` is 2; `b` is now double its previous value.**
