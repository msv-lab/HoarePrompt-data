The provided program is designed to determine how many years it will take for Limak, whose weight is tripled each year, to exceed Bob's weight, which is doubled each year. The problem statement clearly specifies that Limak's weight is initially less than or equal to Bob's weight.

Looking at the code:

```python
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```

1. The program reads two integers `a` and `b` (the weights of Limak and Bob).
2. It initializes a counter `years` to zero.
3. Using a while loop, it continues to multiply Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's weight.
4. It increments the `years` counter each time the loop runs.
5. Finally, it prints the total number of years.

### Edge Cases:
- The program must handle the smallest possible weights, such as `a = 1` and `b = 1`. The current code correctly handles this case by entering the loop once, resulting in Limak's weight becoming 3 while Bob's becomes 2, correctly printing 1 year.
- The program can handle maximum edge case inputs within the constraints (like `a = 10`, `b = 10`), the loop will run until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.
  
### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function reads two integers `a` and `b` for Limak and Bob's weights and calculates the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The provided hints also outline valid cases, supporting the logic of the function.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic as specified in the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any discrepancies or missing edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years required for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight for all valid inputs, as outlined in the problem description and supported by the output hints.
