The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds a new value to the `new_marks` set. The value being added is calculated as `mark + x`, where `mark` is the next element in the `marks` list and `x` is a positive integer. The state of the `new_marks` variable will change, but the other variables remain unaffected in a way that alters their definitions.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and based on the current situation, the updated value in `new_marks` will include the new entry.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + x`.**
