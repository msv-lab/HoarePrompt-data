The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but now `y_found` indicates that the condition regarding the presence of the mark has been met. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the list; `x_found` remains unchanged; `y_found` is True.**
