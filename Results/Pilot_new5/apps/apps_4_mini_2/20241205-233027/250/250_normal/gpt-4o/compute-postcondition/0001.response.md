The `marks` variable is assigned a list created from the input, which consists of integers. The previous state of `a` has been defined as a list of `n` integers that represent marks on the ruler. After the code executes, `marks` will contain the same values as `a` since it is populated from the user input. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l, and `marks` is now a list of integers equal to the input values.

Output State: **`n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l, and `marks` is now a list of integers equal to the input values.**
