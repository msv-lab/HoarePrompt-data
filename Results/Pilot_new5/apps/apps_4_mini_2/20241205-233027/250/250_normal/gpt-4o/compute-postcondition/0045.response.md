Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` may contain values based on the conditions checked against `marks_set`; and either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`.***
