Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`. If `not x_found` is true, and one of the expressions `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. If neither condition is met, then `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
