n is a positive integer representing the number of marks (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer representing the length of the ruler (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers representing the jump norms (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l.
