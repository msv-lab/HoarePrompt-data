Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains `i + j` as an additional element.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains both `i + j` from the previous iteration and the newly added element `i + j` from this iteration.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains all previously added elements, along with the new element `i + j`.

If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged, and its original state is preserved along with `n`, `marks`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains all values that were added during loop execution based on conditions, and if no values were added, it remains unchanged.**
