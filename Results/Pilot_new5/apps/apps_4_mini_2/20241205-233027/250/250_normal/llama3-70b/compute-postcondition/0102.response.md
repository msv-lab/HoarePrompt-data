Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` is updated to reflect the new value added.***
