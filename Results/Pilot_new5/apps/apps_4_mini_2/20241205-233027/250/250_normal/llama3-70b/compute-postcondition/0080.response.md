According to the code, the loop iterates over the `marks` iterable. Since `i` is currently the first element in `marks`, for the loop to execute one more time, `marks` must have at least one more element after the current `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `marks` is a non-empty iterable.
- `i` is the first element in `marks`.

For the loop to execute again, `marks` must have at least 2 elements, so `i` should be updated to the second element in `marks`, thus we can denote `i` as `marks[1]` in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` remains unchanged**.
