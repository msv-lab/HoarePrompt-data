According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. Since it is stated that `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element equal to `i + j`, the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` must be satisfied for this element to exist in the iterable.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element in `marks`, and `j` is the current element from `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have another value. Since `j` has iterated over `additional_marks`, we will move to the next element of `additional_marks`.

Therefore, we need to consider the next value of `j` from `additional_marks`. Assuming `additional_marks` contains more than one element, the next `j` will be the next element in that iterable. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**
