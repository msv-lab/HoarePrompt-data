According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. If `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again for that additional element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` includes values that satisfy the conditions based on `i`, `j`, and `l`. 

Since `j` represents an element in `additional_marks`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next element in `additional_marks`. If we assume that `additional_marks` now has at least one more element after the last iteration, `j` will be the next element in that iterable.

Hence, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should move to the next element in `additional_marks`
- `additional_marks` must still contain at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**
