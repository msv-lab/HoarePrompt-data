According to the code, the loop will execute if the range defined by `i` and `n` has at least one valid integer. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0, the loop will execute since the range will be from `0` to `n-1`, which contains valid integers as long as `n` is at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` will take values from `i` to `n-1`. The initial state of `i` is 0, which means the loop will start with `j` equal to 0.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed `i` needs to remain 0, and `j` will start from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
