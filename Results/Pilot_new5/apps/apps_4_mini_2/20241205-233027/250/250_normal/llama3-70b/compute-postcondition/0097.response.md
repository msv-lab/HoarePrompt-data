According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are additional elements in `additional_marks` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least 1 element, where `j` is the first element. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements, with `j` being the second element in the list. 

Additionally, since `i` is the third element in `marks`, we need to ensure that the new value `i + j` for the next iteration still satisfies the conditions: it must be less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`.

If we assume that `j` is now the second element of `additional_marks`, we denote it as `j` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements where `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, and `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`.**
