The code snippet executes the `print` function, which outputs the length of the `additional_marks` iterable. The value of `len(additional_marks)` depends on the contents of `additional_marks`, which is defined based on the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. However, since no specific values are provided for `additional_marks` or the conditions under which it has been populated, we cannot determine the exact length.

Thus, the output state retains all previous variables' states, with only the length of `additional_marks` affected:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains the values added during loop execution, and the length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
