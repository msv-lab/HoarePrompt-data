The value of `need_y` is assigned True. Since this variable is being set and no other conditions or variable values are affected, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `need_y` is True, and if the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True.**
