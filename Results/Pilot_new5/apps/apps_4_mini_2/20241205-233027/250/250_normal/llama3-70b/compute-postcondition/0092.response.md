According to the code, the loop iterates over `marks`, which is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements. The current state indicates that `i` is the second element in `marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must move to the third element in `marks`. Since `marks` has at least 2 elements, to allow for the next iteration, it must have at least 3 elements. Therefore, the conditions for the next state are that `marks` must have at least 3 elements, `i` should then be the third element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` remains unchanged unless new values are added in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `additional_marks` remains unchanged**.
