The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input and converts the split strings into integers. As a result, the previous values of these variables will be replaced with new integer values entered by the user. Other variables remain unchanged, but their states are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) and they are updated to the values from user input.**
