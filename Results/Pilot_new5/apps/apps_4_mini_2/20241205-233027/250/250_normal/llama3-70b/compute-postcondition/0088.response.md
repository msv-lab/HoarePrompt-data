According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `additional_marks`. The loop will execute for each element in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` contains the element `i + j` if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element after the current iteration. Since the current element `j` is being processed in the loop, we have to ensure that the next `j` in `additional_marks` is ready to be processed.

If we consider that `j` is currently the last element of `additional_marks`, then for the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element than it currently does, and `j` must be set to the next element.

Therefore, if the current `j` is the last element in `additional_marks`, then we need to ensure that there is a new value for `j` which is the next element in `additional_marks`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks, and additional_marks must have at least one more element.**
