The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the value of `i + j` to the list or iterable `additional_marks`. The preconditions state that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`, which means this addition is valid. 

Since `i` is the second element in `marks` and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, the value of `i + j` is calculated and appended to `additional_marks`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` has one more element (the new element is `i + j`), `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, the current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not present in `marks`.**
