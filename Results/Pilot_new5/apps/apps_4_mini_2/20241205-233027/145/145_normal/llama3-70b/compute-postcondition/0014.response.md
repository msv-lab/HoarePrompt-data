The value of `digit` is the second character of `ticket`, which is a string of digits. This means `digit` is a numeric character that can be converted to an integer. Thus, `curr_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `digit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is updated to `curr_sum + int(digit)`; `segments` is 1; `digit` is the second character of `ticket`.**
