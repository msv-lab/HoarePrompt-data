The variable `curr_sum` is initialized to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is now 0; `segments` is 2; `digit` is the second character of `ticket`.
