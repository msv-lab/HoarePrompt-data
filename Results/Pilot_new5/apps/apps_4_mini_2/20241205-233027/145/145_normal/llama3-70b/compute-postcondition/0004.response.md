The code assigns the value of `target_sum` to be half of `total_sum`, which is guaranteed to be an even number. Therefore, `target_sum` becomes `total_sum // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length n (where 2 <= n <= 100) and each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`.**
