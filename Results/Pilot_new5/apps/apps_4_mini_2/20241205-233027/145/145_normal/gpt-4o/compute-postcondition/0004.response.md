According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, this means the loop will execute at least twice (as `n` is at least 2). The states that need to be adjusted are primarily the values of `i`, which will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration. 

At the start of the first iteration, `i` must be initialized to 0. The other variables are set correctly for the loop to execute since they do not impact whether `i` can be incremented or not.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `ticket` is a string of n digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
