The code snippet `current_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates the value of `current_sum` by adding the integer value of the `i`-th character in the string `ticket` to it. The initial value of `current_sum` is 0, and since `i` is 2, `current_sum` will be updated by the integer value of the third digit of `ticket`. 

The variables that have changed are `current_sum`, which will now hold the value of the integer representation of `ticket[2]`, added to its previous value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is the integer value of `ticket[2]`, `segment_count` is updated to 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to `int(ticket[2])`, `segment_count` is updated to 2, `i` is 2.**
