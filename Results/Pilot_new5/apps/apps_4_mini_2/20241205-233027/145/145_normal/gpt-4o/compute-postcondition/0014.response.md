Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is updated to 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains 1.***
