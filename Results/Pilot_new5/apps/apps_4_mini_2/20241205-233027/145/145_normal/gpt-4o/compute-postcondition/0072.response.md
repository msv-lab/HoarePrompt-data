Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` is `n - 1`. If all digits in `ticket` sum up to `target_sum`, then `segment_count` must be greater than 1 for the output to be 'YES'. If no segments match `target_sum`, then `current_sum` must not be equal to 0 or `segment_count` must be less than or equal to 1.**
