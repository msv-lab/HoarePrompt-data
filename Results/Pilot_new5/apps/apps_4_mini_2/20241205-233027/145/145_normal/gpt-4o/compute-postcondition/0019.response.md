Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, and `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the third digit. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segment_count` is incremented by 2 and `i` remains 2. If `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, the function does not alter any variables or state further.***
