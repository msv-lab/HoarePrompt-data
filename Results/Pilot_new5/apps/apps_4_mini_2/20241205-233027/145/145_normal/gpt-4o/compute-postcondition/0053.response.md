The value of `current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of the first digit of the string `ticket`, which corresponds to `ticket[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `current_sum` becomes `current_sum + int(ticket[0])`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to `0 + int(ticket[0])`, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`, `i` is 0**
