The value of `current_sum` is incremented by `int(ticket[i])`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means that `current_sum` will now hold the integer value of the second digit of the string `ticket`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to `current_sum + int(ticket[1])`, `segment_count` is updated to 1, `i` is 1**.
