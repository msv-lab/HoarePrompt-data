The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the parameter `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9. 

After executing the function body, the function can return:
- Case 1: 'YES', indicating that certain conditions involving `current_sum` and `target_sum` have been met, with `segment_count` being greater than 1.
- Case 2: 'YES', without any calculations related to the integer `n`, the string `ticket`, `current_sum`, or `segment_count`.
- Case 3: 'YES', indicating that there exists at least one segment in the ticket where the sum of the digits matches the `target_sum`, and there are more than 1 such segments.
- Case 4: 'NO', based on specific conditions related to `segment_count`, `current_sum`, and `target_sum`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket` of `n` digits, and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on various conditions related to the sums and segments of the digits in the ticket.
