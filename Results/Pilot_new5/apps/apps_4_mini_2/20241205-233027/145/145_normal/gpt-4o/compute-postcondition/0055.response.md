The value of `current_sum` is assigned to `0`. Since `current_sum` was previously equal to `target_sum`, this means that `current_sum` is now `0` while `target_sum` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`, `i` is 0.**
