The `target_sum` is assigned the value of `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, which calculates the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`. The value of `segment_length` is 2, so `segment_sum(0, 1)` is evaluated to find the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`. This will change the value of `target_sum` to be the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`.

The values of `n`, `ticket`, `current_sum`, and `segment_count` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket` modulo `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of times `current_sum` reached `target_sum` during the iteration over the digits of `ticket`.**
