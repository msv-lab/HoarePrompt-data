`total_coverage` is updated by subtracting `cov` from its previous value. The value of `cov` is `-coverage(x, y)`, which means that `-cov` equals `coverage(x, y)`. Therefore, when we subtract `cov`, we are effectively adding `coverage(x, y)` to `total_coverage`. The `heap` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it, and the values of `x` and `y` also remain the same. 

Output State: **`heap` contains `n * m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is now `total_coverage + coverage(x, y)`; `k` must be at least 0; `cov` is `-coverage(x, y)`; `x` is the x-coordinate popped from the heap; `y` is the y-coordinate popped from the heap.**
