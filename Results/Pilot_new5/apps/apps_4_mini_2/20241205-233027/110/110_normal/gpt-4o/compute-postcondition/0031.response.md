Output State: **`heap` contains `n * m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is now `total_coverage + coverage(x, y)`; `k` must be at least 1; `cov` is `-coverage(x, y)`; `x` is the x-coordinate popped from the heap; `y` is the y-coordinate popped from the heap; `cov, x, y` are now assigned the values of the popped tuple from `heap`.**
