According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1. Since `x` will become 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`heap` contains `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` in the range `0` to `m-1`; `x` is 1; `y` is `m` and `n` must be greater than 1**
