According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `y` and `m`. The loop continues as long as `y` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5); heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)` and possibly other entries; `x` is 0; `y` is 2**
