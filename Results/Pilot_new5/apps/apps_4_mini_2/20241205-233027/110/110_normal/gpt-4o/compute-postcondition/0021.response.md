The code snippet uses the `heapq.heappush` function, which pushes a new tuple onto the heap. In this case, the tuple consists of three elements: the negative coverage value calculated from `coverage(x, y)`, and the values of `x` and `y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `heap` contains `2m + 1` tuples, which indicates it is a heap with a specific structure.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 2, which remains unchanged.
- `m` must be greater than 1, which also remains unchanged.

The value pushed onto the `heap` will consist of:
1. The first element is `-coverage(2, 1)`, which is a negative value based on the function `coverage` applied to `x` and `y`.
2. The second element is `x`, which is 2.
3. The third element is `y`, which is 1.

The states of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. The `heap` will now contain one additional tuple reflecting the new addition.

Output State: **`heap` contains `2m + 1 + 1` tuples, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` must be greater than 1, and a new tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)` has been added to the `heap`.**
