Functionality: ** The function accepts four positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` representing the dimensions of a pond, the size of a scoop, and the number of fishes to be placed, respectively. It calculates the minimum of `k` and the total number of possible scoop placements in a `(n - r + 1) x (m - r + 1)` area, and then divides this result by the total number of placements. The function outputs the fraction of fishes that can be placed in relation to the total possible placements, which can range from 0 to 1.**
