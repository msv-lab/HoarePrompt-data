The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `k` and the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are all positive integers, as established in the initial state. 

The value of `ans` depends on the evaluation of `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, where:
- `(n - r + 1)` represents the number of valid selections in `n` after accounting for `r`.
- `(m - r + 1)` represents the number of valid selections in `m` after accounting for `r`.

Thus, the formula for `ans` will yield either `k` or the product of the two expressions, whichever is smaller. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged in this operation (except for the calculation of `ans`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ans` is equal to min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)).**
