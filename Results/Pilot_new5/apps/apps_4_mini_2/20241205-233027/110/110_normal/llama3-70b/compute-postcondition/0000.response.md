The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input received through `map(int, input().split())`. The previous conditions still hold, which state: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be placed, constrained by the given limits. Since the exact values after input are not specified, we cannot provide specific outputs for `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, where each variable is updated to the values obtained from input.**
