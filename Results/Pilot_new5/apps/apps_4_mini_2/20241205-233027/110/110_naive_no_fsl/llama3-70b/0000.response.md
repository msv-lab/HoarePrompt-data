Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected number of caught fishes according to the problem description. 

### Reason for Incorrectness:
1. The main logic of the program calculates `ans` as `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, which gives the minimum of `k` and the number of possible positions for the scoop-net. This does not account for the actual placement of the fishes in a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes.
2. The expected number of caught fishes should be calculated using the formula that considers how many fishes are placed within the area that can be covered by the scoop-net. Instead, the program incorrectly divides by the total number of positions without taking into account the distribution of fishes across the pond.
3. The program fails to consider how the fishes can be distributed and how this affects the expected value. The expected number should be calculated as the ratio of the number of fishes to the number of possible scoop positions, weighted by the specific areas covered by the scoop.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
4 4 2 2
```
The expected output is `1.0000000000` because if you place the fishes optimally (e.g. at (1,1) and (1,2)), the scoop can catch 2 fishes at its maximum capacity. However, the program would output:
```
min(2, (4 - 2 + 1) * (4 - 2 + 1)) / ((4 - 2 + 1) * (4 - 2 + 1)) = 2 / 4 = 0.5
```
This is incorrect, indicating that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the correctness is determined to be **False**.
