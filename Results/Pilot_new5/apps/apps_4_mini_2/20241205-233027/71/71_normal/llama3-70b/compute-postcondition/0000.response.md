The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, which is split into two integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are unknown, but their ranges are defined: `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, and `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the respective integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is the input positive integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.**
