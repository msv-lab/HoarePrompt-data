According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `n`. The loop iterates over the characters in `n` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000. 

Since the loop iterates through each character of `n` from the last character to the first, if `digit` is the last character processed, the next `digit` will be the second-to-last character of `n`. 

Given that `count_zeros` is updated based on the value of `digit`, if the last character processed was '0', then `count_zeros` becomes 1. If `digit` was not '0', then `count_zeros` becomes 0 and `to_remove` would be 1. 

To determine the next state for the loop to execute again, we must consider the length of `n`. Assuming `n` has been processed up to the last character, for the loop to continue executing, we need to know the character that will be processed next.

If the current `digit` is the last character in `n`, the next `digit` will be the character at position `len(n) - 2`, and thus it must still account for the non-empty condition of `n`. 

State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0, `to_remove` is either 0 or 1, `digit` is the second-to-last character in `n`**
