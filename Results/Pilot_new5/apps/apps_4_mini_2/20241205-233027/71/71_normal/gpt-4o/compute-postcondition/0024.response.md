Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if `digit` is '0'; otherwise, `count_zeros` remains `k` and `to_remove` is incremented by 1. In either case, `digit` is updated to the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.***
