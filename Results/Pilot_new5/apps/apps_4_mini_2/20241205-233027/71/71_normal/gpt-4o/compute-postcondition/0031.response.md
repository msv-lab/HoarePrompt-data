The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer that does not exceed 2,000,000,000, and the parameter `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9. Based on the provided output conditions, the function's behavior is not explicitly described, but we can outline the expected functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (not exceeding 2,000,000,000) and a positive integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 9). The exact return value based on these parameters is not detailed.**
