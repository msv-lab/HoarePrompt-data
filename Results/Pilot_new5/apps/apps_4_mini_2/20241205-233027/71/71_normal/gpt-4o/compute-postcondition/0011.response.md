The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be an empty string; if the last character `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1, with `digit` being not '0'. The current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
