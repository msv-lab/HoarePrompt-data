`to_remove` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `to_remove` could either be 0 or 1, making the new possible values of `to_remove` either 1 or 2. The values of `n`, `count_zeros`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0, `to_remove` is either 1 or 2, `digit` is the second-to-last character in `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty; `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0; `to_remove` is either 1 or 2; `digit` is the second-to-last character in `n`.**
