Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be an empty string; if the last character `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1, with `digit` being not '0'.***
