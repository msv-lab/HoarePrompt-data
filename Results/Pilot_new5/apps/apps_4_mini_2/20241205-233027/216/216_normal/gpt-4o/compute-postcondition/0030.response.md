`current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `max_count` is updated to max(max_count, current_count), `current_set` is now an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.
