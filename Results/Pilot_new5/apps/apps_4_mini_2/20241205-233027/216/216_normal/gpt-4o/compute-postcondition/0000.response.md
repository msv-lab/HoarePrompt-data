The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` while keeping `s` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a string consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and `n` is an input integer.**
