The variable `current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is 0, so after the operation, `current_count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the first character in `s` and a lowercase letter; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` contains `char`; `current_count` is 1.
