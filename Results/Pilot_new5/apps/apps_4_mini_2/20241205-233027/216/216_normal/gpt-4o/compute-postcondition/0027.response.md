Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, `current_set` now includes `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, no changes are made to `current_set` or `current_count`.***
