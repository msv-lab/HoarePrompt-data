Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the first character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then `current_set` contains `char` and `current_count` is 1 if `char` was not previously in `current_set`. Otherwise, `current_set` remains empty and `current_count` is still 0.***
