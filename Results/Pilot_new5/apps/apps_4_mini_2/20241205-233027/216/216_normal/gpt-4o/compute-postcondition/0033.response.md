The value of `max_count` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. Since `max_count` holds the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in any contiguous sequence of lowercase letters in `s`, it will either remain the same or increase depending on the value of `current_count`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `max_count` is updated to max(max_count, current_count); `current_set` is empty; `current_count` is 0.**
