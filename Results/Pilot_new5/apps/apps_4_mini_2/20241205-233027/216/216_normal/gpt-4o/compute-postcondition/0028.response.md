The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. The variable `max_count` will be updated based on the comparison but the previous values of `n`, `s`, and `char` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that `max_count` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `max_count` is updated to max(max_count, current_count)**.
