According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 2, because `range(1, t)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to `t - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 2. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take its first value of 1. Additionally, since `speeds` is a list of length `t` with `speeds[0]` equal to `v1` and `speeds[-1]` equal to `v2`, it is ensured that the first and last elements of the list are set correctly with the provided conditions.

So, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `i` is now 1.

State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1` and speeds[-1] is equal to `v2`, and i is now 1**
