To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where:
- `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1`, 
- `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, 
- `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v2`, 
- `i` is 2.

The line of code provided is:
```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Now, let's break down the impact of this line of code:

1. `speeds[i]` is assigned a new value, which is the minimum of two calculations:
   - The first calculation is `speeds[i - 1] + d`, which refers to the speed at index `i - 1` (which is `speeds[1]`) plus `d`.
   - The second calculation is `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which is `v2` plus a term dependent on `t`, `i`, and `d`.

2. The variable `i` has the value of `2`, so `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[1]`, which is already defined as `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.

3. The code will therefore update `speeds[2]` with the calculated minimum value.

After executing the code, the `speeds` list will have its third element (`speeds[2]`) updated, while the other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1`, speeds[1] is equal to min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), speeds[2] is updated to min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d), speeds[-1] is equal to `v2`, and `i` is 2.**
