The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any parameters. However, it relies on the constraints of the variables `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`.

Given the constraints:
- `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \( 1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100 \)
- `t` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq t \leq 100 \)
- `d` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq d \leq 10 \)

The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return values. However, we can assume that the function utilizes these input constraints to produce some result based on the logic within the function when it is called.

Since specific return cases or outputs are not provided, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints alone. 

Functionality: **The function relies on integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100), an integer t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), and an integer d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) for its internal logic and output, but does not accept parameters directly.**
