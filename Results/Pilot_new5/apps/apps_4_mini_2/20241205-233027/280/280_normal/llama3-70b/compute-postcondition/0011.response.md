According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1, making it `t - 2`. Since `t` is at least 2, this will ensure `i` remains non-negative.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `t - 2`.

State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed, `i` is `t - 2`**
