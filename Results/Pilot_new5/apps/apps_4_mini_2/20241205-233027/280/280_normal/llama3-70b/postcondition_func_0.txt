The function accepts input for two integer speeds (`v1` and `v2`), a time duration (`t`), and a change in speed (`d`). It calculates the maximum and minimum lengths traveled over the time period, considering adjustments to the speeds based on `d`, and then prints the maximum length. It does not return any values or handle any invalid input cases.
