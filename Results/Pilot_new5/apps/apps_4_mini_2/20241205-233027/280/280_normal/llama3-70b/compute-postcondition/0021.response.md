To analyze the loop and determine the final output state after all iterations, we need to consider the initial values and how they are transformed by the loop. The loop iterates from `t - 1` down to `1`, which means that if `t` is at least `2`, the loop will execute `t - 1` times.

### Analysis:
1. **Starting values:**
   - `max_speed` starts as `max(v_1, v_2)`.
   - `min_speed` starts as `min(v_1, v_2)`.
   - `max_length` starts as `max(v_1, v_2) * t`.
   - `min_length` starts as `min(v_1, v_2) * t`.

2. **Loop behavior:**
   - Each iteration decreases `max_speed` by `d` and increases `min_speed` by `d`, but these values are constrained by each other.
   - `max_length` accumulates the current `max_speed` at each iteration.
   - `min_length` accumulates the current `min_speed` at each iteration.
   - The loop runs `t - 1` times if `t` is greater than `1`.

3. **Final values after all iterations:**
   - After `t - 1` iterations:
     - `max_speed` will be reduced by `d` a total of `t - 1` times, but it cannot go below `min_speed`.
     - `min_speed` will be increased by `d` a total of `t - 1` times, but it cannot exceed the final value of `max_speed`.
     - `max_length` will be the initial `max_length` plus `(t - 1) * max_speed` (the sum of `max_speed` over all iterations).
     - `min_length` will be the initial `min_length` plus `(t - 1) * min_speed` (the sum of `min_speed` over all iterations).

### Output State:
Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least `2`, we can conclude:

- If the loop runs its full course (i.e., `t > 1`), then the values at the end will be:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is `max(v_1, v_2) - (t - 1) * d`, `min_speed` is `min(v_1, v_2) + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + (t - 1) * max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + (t - 1) * min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`**
