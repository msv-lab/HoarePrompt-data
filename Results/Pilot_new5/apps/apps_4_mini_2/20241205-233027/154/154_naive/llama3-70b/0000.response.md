To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of tasks.
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task.
   - `M`: Total available time in minutes.
   - `t`: List of times required to solve each subtask.

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - Each subtask solved gives one point.
   - Completing all subtasks of a task gives an additional bonus point.

3. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the points Polycarp can earn given the time constraints.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum points. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- The variable `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks solved using the first `i` subtasks with exactly `j` minutes.
- The program iterates through each subtask and each possible time limit to fill in the `dp` table.
- Finally, it attempts to sum the total points earned by counting solved subtasks and adding bonus points for fully completed tasks.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Missing Complete Task Bonus Calculation**: 
   The expression `sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i))` does not correctly account for the condition that a complete task (all `k` subtasks) completed should yield an additional point. The loop checks if the number of subtasks solved equals the index, which does not necessarily mean a task was completed. 

2. **Time Constraints**: 
   The program does not seem to handle the case where the total time `M` is less than the time required for any subtask. It should easily return zero points in such a case.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: 
   The `dp` array is initialized in a way that might not correctly reflect the state when no subtasks can be solved because of time constraints.

### Example of Failure Case:
Consider the input:

```
1 1 0
1
```

Here, Polycarp has:
- 1 task with 1 subtask that takes 1 minute.
- 0 total minutes available.

Expected output is `0` since no subtasks can be solved in `0` minutes. However, the program's logic does not ensure that it correctly calculates this, as it may return points based on an erroneous state of `dp`.

### Conclusion:
Given these observations, especially with regards to missing logic in handling complete task bonuses and edge cases involving unavailable time, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
