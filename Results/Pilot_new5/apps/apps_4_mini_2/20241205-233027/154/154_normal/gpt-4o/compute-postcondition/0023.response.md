The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, which determines how many subtasks can be solved based on the remaining time. The variable `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `points`, `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
