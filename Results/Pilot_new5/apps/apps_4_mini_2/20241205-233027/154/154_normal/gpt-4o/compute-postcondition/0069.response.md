The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated to be equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated accordingly, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated to equal `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated accordingly, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
