To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to closely analyze both the problem description and the implementation of the code.

### Problem Description Recap:

1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
   - `M`: Total available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9)
   - `t`: A list of integers representing the time to solve each subtask (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000)

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - Completing all `k` subtasks of a task grants `k + 1` points.
   - Solving any subtask grants 1 point.

3. **Goal**:
   - Maximize the points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   The program reads input correctly, parsing integers for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t`.

2. **Points Calculation Logic**:
   - The program initializes `total_time_per_task` as the sum of all subtask times, which is correct.
   - The outer loop iterates over the possible number of fully completed tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`.
   - It calculates `time_used` to check if Polycarp has enough time to complete `complete_tasks`.
   - It computes `points` for completed tasks correctly as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.

3. **Remaining Time Calculation**:
   - After accounting for the time used for complete tasks, it computes `remaining_time`.
   - The program then attempts to maximize the number of solved subtasks using the remaining time, iterating over each subtask duration in `t`.
   - The calculation of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is done correctly, ensuring that the total points from both completed tasks and additional subtasks are calculated.

4. **Final Points Calculation**:
   - It ensures that `subtasks_solved` does not exceed the maximum number of available subtasks from incomplete tasks.
   - Finally, the maximum points are updated accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the code adheres to the problem requirements. It computes the total points maximally under the constraints of time and task limitations. 

There is no case in the problem description that the program fails to accommodate, as it correctly handles various scenarios of task completion and leftover time for subtasks.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
