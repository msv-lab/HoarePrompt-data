Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used` after considering all possible subtasks in the list `t`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to the total number of subtasks solved based on the available `remaining_time` and the corresponding `subtask_time` values from `t`. If no subtasks could be solved due to insufficient `remaining_time`, then `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
