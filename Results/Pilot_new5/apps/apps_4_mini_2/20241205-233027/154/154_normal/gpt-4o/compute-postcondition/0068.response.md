According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection `t`. If `t` has more than one element, the loop can execute again for the next subtask time. At the end of the last iteration, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and after the loop, `subtask_time` will be updated to the next element in the collection `t`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must have at least 2 elements, and `subtask_time` must be the second element in `t`. Therefore, the states should be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated accordingly, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to remaining_time // subtask_time after the update.**
