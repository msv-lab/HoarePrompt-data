Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a non-empty collection, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and the current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
