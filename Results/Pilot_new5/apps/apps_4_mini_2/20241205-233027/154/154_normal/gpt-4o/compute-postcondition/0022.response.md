The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time // subtask_time`, which means it is the result of integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but the value of `remaining_time` is assumed to be known.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `t` must have at least one more element.**
