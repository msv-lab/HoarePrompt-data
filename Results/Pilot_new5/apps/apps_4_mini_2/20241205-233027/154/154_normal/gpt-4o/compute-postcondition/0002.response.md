According to the code, the loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`, inclusive. This means for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 0, which it is by definition (1 ≤ n ≤ 45). Therefore, the loop can execute regardless of the values of `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, and `max_points`, as none of these affect the loop's execution count directly.

Before the loop starts, `complete_tasks` will initialize at 0 for the first iteration. There are no additional constraints or changes needed regarding `total_time_per_task` or `max_points` in relation to the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0**
