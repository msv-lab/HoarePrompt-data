The code decreases `remaining_time` by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The value of `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, but the specific values of `remaining_time`, `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` before the operation need to be maintained for the output.

The output state will reflect the changes in `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved`, while retaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`, `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_points` is unchanged, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
