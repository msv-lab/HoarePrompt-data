The code snippet `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` updates the value of `remaining_time`. 

1. `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, which determines how many full subtasks can be completed with the current `remaining_time`.
2. The expression `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` calculates the total time used for the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved.
3. `remaining_time` is then reduced by this calculated total time.

Since `remaining_time` is reduced, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated to its previous value minus `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
