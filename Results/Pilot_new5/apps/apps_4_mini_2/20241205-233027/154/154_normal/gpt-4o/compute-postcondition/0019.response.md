The code snippet modifies the `remaining_time` variable by subtracting the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The previous values of the affected variables are `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `subtask_time`. 

The updates are as follows:
- `remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.

Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `M // subtask_time`, we can express the change in `remaining_time` as:
- `remaining_time = remaining_time - (M // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

The other variables (`n`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `points`, `subtasks_solved`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `remaining_time - (M // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `M // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
