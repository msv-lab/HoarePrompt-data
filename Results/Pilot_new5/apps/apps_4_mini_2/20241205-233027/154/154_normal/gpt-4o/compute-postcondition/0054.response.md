The variable `max_points` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The values of `max_points_current`, `points`, and `subtasks_solved` are not specified, but we know that `subtasks_solved` is currently `0`. Therefore, `max_points` will be updated based on the value of `points`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points + 0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`.**
