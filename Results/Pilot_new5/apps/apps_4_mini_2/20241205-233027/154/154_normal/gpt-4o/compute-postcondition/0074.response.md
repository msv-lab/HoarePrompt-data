The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the result of the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The value of `remaining_time` is still dependent on its previous calculation, while `subtask_time` is now the next element in `t` at index `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is still dependent on its previous calculation, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t` at index `i + 1`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
