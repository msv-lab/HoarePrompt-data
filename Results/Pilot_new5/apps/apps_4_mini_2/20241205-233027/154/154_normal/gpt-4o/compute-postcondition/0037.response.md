Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is M - time_used, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved), `t` contains at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and the current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
