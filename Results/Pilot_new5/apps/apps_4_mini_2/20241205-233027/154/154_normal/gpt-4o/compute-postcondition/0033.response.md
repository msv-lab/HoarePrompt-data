The calculation of `points` is performed by multiplying `complete_tasks` (which remains `n` if `time_used` exceeds `M`) by `(k + 1)`. Since `complete_tasks` is `n`, the value of `points` becomes `n * (k + 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the current state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45); `complete_tasks` remains `n`; `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`; `remaining_time` is negative; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k; `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
