Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to its previous value minus `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, there are no changes made to the variables.***
