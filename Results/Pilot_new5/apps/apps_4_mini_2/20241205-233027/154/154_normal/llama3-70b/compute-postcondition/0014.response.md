According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `M + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached its maximum value, which is `M`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1, which means `j` will be `M + 1`. Since the loop condition requires `j` to be less than or equal to `M`, the loop will not execute again unless `M` is increased. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be increased to at least `M + 1` and `j` should take this new value of `M + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` must be greater than `M`, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `j` is `M + 1`**
