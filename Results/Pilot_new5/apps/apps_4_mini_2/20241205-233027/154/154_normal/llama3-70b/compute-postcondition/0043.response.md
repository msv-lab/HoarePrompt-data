Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, then `dp[1][2]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[1][2]` and `dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1`, and `dp[1][1]` remains equal to `dp[1][0]`. If `j` is less than `t[0]`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged in the current context.***
