According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 1 to `M`. The current state indicates that `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. This means `j` will be 3 in the next iteration.

Since `M` is at least 2, the loop can execute again as long as `j` (which will be 3) is less than or equal to `M`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `M` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3**
