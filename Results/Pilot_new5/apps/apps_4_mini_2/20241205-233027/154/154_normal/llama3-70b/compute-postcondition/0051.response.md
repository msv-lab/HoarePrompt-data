The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of tasks, which must be between 1 and 45 (inclusive).
- `k` is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task, which must also be between 1 and 45 (inclusive).
- `M` is a non-negative integer representing the total minutes available, bounded between 0 and 2·10^9 (inclusive).
- `t` is a list of integers of length `k`, where each element `t[j]` (with `1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000`) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask of any task.

The function's output is based on the provided conditions and relationships. However, the specifics of the return values are not detailed in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of tasks), k (number of subtasks per task), M (total minutes available), and t (list of time required for each subtask), and it returns a result based on these inputs.**
