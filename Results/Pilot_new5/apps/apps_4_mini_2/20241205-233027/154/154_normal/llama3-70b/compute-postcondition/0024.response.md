Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[k]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.***
