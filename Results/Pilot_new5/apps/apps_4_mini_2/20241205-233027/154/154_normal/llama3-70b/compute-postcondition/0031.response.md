In the provided code snippet, `dp[i][j]` is updated as follows:

1. `i` is `k + 1`, which means we are referencing the `k + 1`-th row of the `dp` array.
2. `j` is `3`, so we are working with the third column of the `dp` array.
3. The code assigns `dp[i][j]` the maximum value between its current value `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

Given that `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, and considering the bounds of `i` and `j`, the value accessed in `t` will be valid as long as `i - 1` (which equals `k`) is within the range of the list `t`.

Thus, if the values of `dp` at the relevant indices are known, we can calculate the new value for `dp[k + 1][3]`. However, we do not have the specific values in `dp` or `t`, so we cannot compute an exact numerical output. Instead, we summarize the change:

- The assignment affects the `dp` array, specifically the value at `dp[k + 1][3]`.

Since the changes affect the `dp` structure directly without altering other variables in the initial state, the final output state will reflect this:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3, and `dp[k + 1][3]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[k][3 - t[k - 1]] + 1`.**
