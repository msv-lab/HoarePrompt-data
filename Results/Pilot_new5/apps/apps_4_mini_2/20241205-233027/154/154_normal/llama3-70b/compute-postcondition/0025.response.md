According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2 in the next iteration. 

The variable `M` indicates the upper limit for `j`, and since `M` is at least 1, having `j` equal to 2 is valid as long as `M` is at least 2. 

Thus, if `M` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. If `M` is only 1, the loop cannot execute again because `j` would exceed `M`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `M` must be at least 2, and `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][j]` is updated depending on the conditions.**
