According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `M`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `M` (inclusive), and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `M`, as it is the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be `M + 1`, which is outside the current bounds of the loop. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again unless `M` is increased.

Given that `n` and `k` are within their specified limits, and `M` is at least 1, if we want the loop to execute again, we need to ensure `M` is greater than `M`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` must be greater than `M`, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j >= t[i - 1]`.**
