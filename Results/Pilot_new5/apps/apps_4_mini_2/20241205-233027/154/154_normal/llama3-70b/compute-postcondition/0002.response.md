The list `t` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged, while the order of elements in list `t` is altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer representing the total minutes available (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k` where each element `t[j]` is assigned the sorted values from the input (1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000).

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer representing the total minutes available (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k` where each element `t[j]` is a sorted value from input (1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000).**
