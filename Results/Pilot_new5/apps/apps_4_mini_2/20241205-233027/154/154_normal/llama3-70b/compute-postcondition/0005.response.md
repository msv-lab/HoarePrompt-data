To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop and the provided state variables:

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `M + 1`. This means the loop will execute if `M` is at least 1 (since the range is inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end).

2. The current state indicates that `M` is within the limits given (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), but for the loop to execute, we specifically require `M` to be at least 1. 

3. The variable `i` is initialized to 1, and this does not need to change for the loop to execute as it is not used in the loop condition.

4. The list `dp` and the list `t` are also defined, but they do not directly affect the execution of the loop in terms of the loop condition itself.

Based on this analysis, the only necessary adjustment is that `M` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `dp` is a list of lists with length `k + 1` and each sublist of length `M + 1`, `i` is 1**
