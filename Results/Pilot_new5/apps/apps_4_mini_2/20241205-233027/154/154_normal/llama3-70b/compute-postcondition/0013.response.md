Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` must be greater than `M`, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
