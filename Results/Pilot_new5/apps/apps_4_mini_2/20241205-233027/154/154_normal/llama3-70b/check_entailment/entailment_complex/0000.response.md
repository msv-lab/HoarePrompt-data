To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both closely.

### Problem Description Analysis:
1. **Input Requirements**:
   - `n`: number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
   - `k`: number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
   - `M`: available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9)
   - `t`: a list of integers of length `k` where each element `t[j]` (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program must calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn in `M` minutes.
   - Points are earned as follows:
     - Each solved subtask earns 1 point.
     - Completing a task (all `k` subtasks) gives an additional point.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of tasks, number of subtasks, available minutes, and the time required for each subtask.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The program initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with `i` subtasks considered and `j` minutes.
   - It iteratively fills this table based on whether the current subtask can be completed within the available minutes.

3. **Point Calculation**:
   - After populating the `dp` table, the program calculates the total number of subtasks solved within `M` minutes across all subtasks.
   - Additionally, it counts how many of the tasks could be fully completed by checking if `dp[i][M] == i`.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program aims to maximize the points Polycarp can earn, which includes both the points from individual subtasks and potential bonus points from completing tasks.
- The approach is a valid way to tackle the problem using dynamic programming to optimize the number of tasks completed within the available minutes.

### Possible Issues:
- The program does not seem to account for the fact that Polycarp has `n` tasks available. While it computes the maximum subtasks he can complete within `M` minutes, it does not consider this limitation in the context of the number of tasks to be completed.
- Specifically, the logic should account for the maximum points from up to `n` tasks, but the current implementation only considers the maximum subtasks without directly incorporating the task limit.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the logic to compute subtasks completed but fails to account for the limitation of `n` tasks when calculating the maximum points, it does not fully adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
