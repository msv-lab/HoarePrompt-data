To analyze the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's break down how the function `func_1(n, k)` works and whether it meets the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Two integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned on each side).
2. **Operation**: When a skewer `i` is turned, it turns `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right of it, including itself (`2k + 1` skewers total).
3. **Goal**: Minimize the number of turning actions needed to turn all `n` skewers.

### Analysis of Provided Code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `positions` list is initialized to store the skewers that will be turned.
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by `2 * k + 1` in each iteration.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n`.
   - The position `i` is added to the `positions` list, which means that for every `2k + 1` skewers, one skewer is turned.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the `positions` list (number of actions) and the skewers that were turned.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: Let's consider the edge case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`.
  - Expected output: 1 (only skewer 1 needs to be turned).
  - The program would output:
    ```
    1
    1
    ```
  - This case is correctly handled.

- **Case 2**: Now, consider `n = 5` and `k = 1`.
  - Expected output: 2 (turn skewers 1 and 4, which cover all skewers).
  - The program would output:
    ```
    2
    1 4
    ```
  - This case is also correctly handled.

- **Case 3**: Now, `n = 7` with `k = 2`.
  - Expected output: 2 (turn skewers 1 and 5).
  - The program would output:
    ```
    2
    1 6
    ```
  - This case is handled but does it cover all skewers?
    - Turning skewer 1 turns skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 while turning skewer 6 turns skewers 5, 6, 7, which means skewer 5 gets turned twice (to the initial position on the second turn) and thus is not turned over at the end.
  
Based on this analysis, the program fails in some scenarios, specifically when `k` is large enough to encompass the skewers around the turned skewer, leading to a situation where some skewers are not effectively turned.

### Conclusion:
The first case shows that there are scenarios where the program does not ensure all skewers are turned over correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed for every possible input.

Correctness: **False**.
