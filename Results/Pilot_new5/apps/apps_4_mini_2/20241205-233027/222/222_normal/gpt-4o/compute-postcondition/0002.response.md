According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000). Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (which it is, since `n` is a positive integer). 

No adjustments are required for the values of `i` or `n` to ensure the loop will execute at least once. The fact that `positions` is an empty list and `k` is a non-negative integer does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
