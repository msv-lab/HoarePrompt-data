The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, the relationship between `n` and `i` remains valid. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to the updated value of `i`, which is `i + 2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2 * k + 1`**
