According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2 * k + 1`. This condition ensures that the loop will execute as long as `i` does not exceed `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is already set as greater than or equal to `i + 2 * k + 1`, it is necessary for there to be a relationship between `i` and `n` that allows the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least `i + 1` (to allow one more iteration). Thus, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it satisfies the condition for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
