#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `positions` contains all values `1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3, ..., (2 * k + 1)*(m - 1) + 1`; `i` is `2 * k * m + m + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k * m + m + 1`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 with increments of `2 * k + 1` until exceeding `n`, and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, but does not return any values.
