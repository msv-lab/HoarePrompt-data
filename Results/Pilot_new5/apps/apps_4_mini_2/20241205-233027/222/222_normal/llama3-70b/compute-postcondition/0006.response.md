The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` calculates a new value to append to the list `res`. The variable `i` is 1, so we can substitute it directly into the expression. The value of the expression becomes `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k * 2 + 1 + 1`, or `k * 2 + 2`.

The list `res` originally contains the value `[1]`, and after appending the new value, it will now contain `[1, k * 2 + 2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing the values `[1, k * 2 + 2]`.**
