The value of `i` is 2, and `res` is initialized to contain the values `[1, k * 2 + 2]`. The expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` can be calculated as follows:

1. The value of `k * 2 + 1` is dependent on `k`, so we will express `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` in terms of `k`.
2. Therefore, `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` becomes `res.append(2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`.

The value appended to `res` will be `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, resulting in `2k + 2 + 1 = 2k + 3`.

The new state of `res` will be `[1, k * 2 + 2, 2k + 3]`. The conditions for `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list containing the values `[1, k * 2 + 2, 2k + 3]`**.
