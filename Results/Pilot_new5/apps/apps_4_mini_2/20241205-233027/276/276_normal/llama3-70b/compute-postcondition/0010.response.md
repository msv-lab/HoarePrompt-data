The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list containing two non-empty strings. Each string consists only of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000 characters. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the product of the integer conversion of each character in the first string and the corresponding character in the second string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of two strings containing '0' and '1' characters and return the sum of the products of their integer values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `s` of two non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of the product of the integer values of corresponding characters in the two strings.**
