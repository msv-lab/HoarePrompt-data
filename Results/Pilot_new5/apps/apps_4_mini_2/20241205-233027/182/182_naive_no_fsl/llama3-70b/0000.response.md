To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the implementation in relation to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `x` which represents the camera's rotation angle in degrees.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The line `x = x % 360` reduces the angle to a value between `0` to `359` degrees. This is correct because the rotation behavior is periodic every 360 degrees.

3. **Edge Case for Zero**: The check for `if x == 0:` prints `0`, which is correct since no rotations are needed for a zero rotation angle.

4. **Calculating the Number of 90-degree Turns**: The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is used to compute the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations:
   - `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` effectively rounds up the division of `x` by `90`.
   - The `% 4` ensures that the number of turns is wrapped around since every 4 turns results in a complete rotation back to the original position.

However, the program does not account for negative angles properly. When `x` is negative (e.g., `-60`), the reduction using `x % 360` gives:
   - `x = -60 % 360` results in `300`. 

Using the formula:
- For `x = 300`, the computation would yield:
  ```python
  (300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = (389 // 90) % 4 = 4 % 4 = 0
  ```
This would incorrectly suggest no rotations are needed when, in fact, a counter-clockwise rotation should translate to 3 clockwise rotations (to correct that deviation).

To see this in another example:
- Input: `-60`
- Correct logic should yield `3` turns because:
  - One 90-degree clockwise turn results in a clockwise rotation of `330` degrees, which is `30` degrees counter-clockwise from vertical.
  - Two turns yield `240`, which corresponds to `120` degrees deviation.
  - Three turns yield `150`, resulting in a deviation of `30` degrees.

Thus, the program does not cover all cases correctly, particularly the edge of negative angles translating to the correct number of 90-degree clockwise rotations.

**Correctness: False**  
The program fails for negative angles, as demonstrated, producing incorrect results. For example, an input of `-60` should return `3` but the current implementation would erroneously return `0`.
