The code is a print statement that outputs the value of `turns`. The variables `x` and `normalized_angle` are preconditions, but only `turns` will be affected by the calculations based on the value of `x`. 

Given the initial definitions:
- `normalized_angle` is calculated as `x % 360`.
- `turns` is calculated as `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4`.

The exact value of `turns` will depend on the specific input integer `x`. However, the output will still be valid regardless of the actual value of `x`. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`x` is an input integer representing the camera angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is equal to (360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4, and `turns` is printed.**
