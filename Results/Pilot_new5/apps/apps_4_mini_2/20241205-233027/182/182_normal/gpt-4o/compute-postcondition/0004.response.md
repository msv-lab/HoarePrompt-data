The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it uses a variable `x`, which is expected to be an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, constrained within the range of -10^18 to 10^18. The function's output is based on the value of `x` and is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot detail the specific output without additional context. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but utilizes a variable x representing the camera angle in degrees, constrained between -10^18 and 10^18. The specific return value based on x is not provided.**
