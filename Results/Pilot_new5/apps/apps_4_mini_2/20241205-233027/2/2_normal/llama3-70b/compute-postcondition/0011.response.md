The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` will now also be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 1**.
