The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is specified that the function has an implicit constraint that `x` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, although there is no direct input for `x`. Since the function does not take any parameters nor does it specify any output behavior, we cannot identify specific cases or return values based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not specify any return values based on the given constraints.**
