According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `x`. The loop will execute for `i` starting from 1 up to `x`, inclusive. Since `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, the loop will execute at least once for any valid value of `x`. Before the loop starts, we have `max_sum` as 0 and `max_num` also as 0, but those do not affect the loop's ability to execute. The loop will initialize `i` to 1 at the start.

Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied by the state of `x`, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer. 

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1**
