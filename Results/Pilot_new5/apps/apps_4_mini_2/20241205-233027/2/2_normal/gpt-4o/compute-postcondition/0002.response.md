Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^18) and calculates the sum of its digits, returning that sum. It handles the entire range of valid positive integers correctly, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases since `n` is guaranteed to be within the specified bounds. **
