Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `h` (1 ≤ h ≤ 50) and `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h). It computes a sum based on the iterative halving of `n`, where it adds different values to `ans` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, and continues this process until `n` equals 1. Finally, it outputs the computed sum `ans`.**
