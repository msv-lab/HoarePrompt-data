The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged values of `h` and `n`, along with the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `ans` is 0**
