To analyze the impact of the code `ans += n // 2`, we start with the initial state where `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, and `ans` is initialized to 0.

1. Since `n` is greater than 1 and odd, it can be expressed as `n = 2k + 1` for some integer `k ≥ 1`, which makes `n // 2 = k`.
2. The operation `ans += n // 2` updates `ans` by adding the value of `n // 2` to it.
3. Given that `ans` starts at 0, after executing the code, `ans` will be equal to `n // 2`.

Now we summarize the impact on the variables:
- The value of `ans` changes from 0 to `n // 2`.
- The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the operation.

Putting these points together, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than 1 and odd, `ans` is equal to `n // 2`.**
