In this case, the code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` will update the value of `current_node`. 

The initial state indicates that `current_node` is defined based on the direction of the next character in `path`, but since the specific value of `current_node` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe how it will be affected by the code.

Given that `current_node` is multiplied by 2 and then 2 is added, the output state will reflect this change. However, since `current_node`'s initial value is unknown, we can express the updated state in terms of its new value.

The other variables remain unchanged and valid as per their descriptions in the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.**
