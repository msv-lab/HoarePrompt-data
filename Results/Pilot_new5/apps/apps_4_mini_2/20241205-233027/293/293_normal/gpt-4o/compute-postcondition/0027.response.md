The function `func_1` reads two integers `h` and `n` from standard input, where `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). It calculates a binary representation of `n - 1`, ensuring it is zero-padded to a length of `h`. The function navigates a binary tree based on this binary path, counting the number of nodes (or directions) visited during this traversal. The final output is the count of visited nodes printed to standard output.

Importantly, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The implementation does not perform any validation on the input values beyond assuming they meet the specified constraints. Therefore, if the constraints are not met (e.g., if inputs are outside the specified range), the behavior is not defined.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads two integers from input, and prints the count of visited nodes in a binary tree based on the binary representation of `n - 1`, where the tree has a height of `h`. **
