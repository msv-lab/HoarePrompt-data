Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0, and `direction` is not equal to '0'.***
