The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 1`. However, the initial value of `current_node` is not provided in the initial state, making it impossible to calculate the new value. Thus, the output state will reflect that `current_node` is potentially updated but remains undefined in terms of a specific value.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1` but remains undefined.**
