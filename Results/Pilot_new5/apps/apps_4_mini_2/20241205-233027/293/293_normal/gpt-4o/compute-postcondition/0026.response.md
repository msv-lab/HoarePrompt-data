The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the defined constraints: `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns based solely on the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is currently unclear due to the lack of defined output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
