Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), `r` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `z` is equal to `y // x` where `z` must be greater than or equal to 1, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `z % i == 0`).***
