To analyze the final output state of the loop given the initial state and the loop code, we can proceed as follows:

Initial State: `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Code of the loop:
```
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```

Output State after loop executes 1 time: `a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`, where `a_initial` and `b_initial` are the initial positive integer values of `a` and `b`.

Output State after loop executes 2 times: `a` is `b_initial`, `b` must be non-zero, `b` is now `a_initial % b_initial`, which means `b` can be represented as `b_initial` if `a_initial` is greater than `b_initial`. If `b` is the initial value of `b`, then `a` can be updated to `b_initial` and `b` will equal `a_initial % b_initial`, which is a positive integer since both `a` and `b` were positive integers initially.

Output State after loop executes 3 times: `a` remains as `b_initial`, and `b` becomes `a_initial % b_initial`, which will be a positive integer. If the value of `b` reaches 0, the loop will terminate.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, when `b` becomes 0, `a` will hold the last non-zero value of `b`. This is a common characteristic of the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Thus, after the loop terminates, the output states can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`**
