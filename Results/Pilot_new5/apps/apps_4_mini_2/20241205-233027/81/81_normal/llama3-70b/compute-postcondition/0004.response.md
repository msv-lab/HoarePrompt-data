According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is currently equal to `b_initial % b_initial`, which is 0, thus `b` is not non-zero, and the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted so that it is non-zero. Since `b_initial % b_initial` leads to 0, it indicates that `b_initial` must be adjusted to ensure `b` can be set to a non-zero value.

Since we know from the constraints that `b` must equal `a_initial % b_initial`, we need to ensure that `b` does not become 0. Therefore, we can adjust the state so that `b` is equal to `a_initial - k*b_initial` for some integer k, where `a_initial` is greater than `b_initial` to prevent `b` from being zero.

State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` must be adjusted to be non-zero and equal to `a_initial - k*b_initial` for some integer k**
