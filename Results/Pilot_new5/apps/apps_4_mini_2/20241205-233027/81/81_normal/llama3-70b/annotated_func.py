#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues iterating until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`, the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative, as the GCD is only defined for positive integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≤ b and GCD(a, b) is a divisor of LCM(a, b).
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b), where GCD(a, b) is a divisor of LCM(a, b) and both a and b are positive integers such that a ≤ b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is less than or equal to `b`. It returns the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is expected to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and there is no error handling for cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return 0, which would lead to a division error. Thus, the function may face issues if `func_1` does not behave as expected.
