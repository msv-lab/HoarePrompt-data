Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues iterating until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`, the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative, as the GCD is only defined for positive integers. **
