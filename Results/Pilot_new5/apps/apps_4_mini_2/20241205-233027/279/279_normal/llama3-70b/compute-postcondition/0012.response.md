The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `i` is less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, `ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n - 1**.
