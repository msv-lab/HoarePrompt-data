Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, and `ans` is an integer. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains as `n`. If `p[i]` equals `i + 1`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.
```
ans += 1
```
Now, considering the impact of the code:

- The operation `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1.
- The state of `i`, `n`, `p`, and `b` remains unchanged as they are not modified by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the increment of `ans`. The value of `ans` will now be one greater than its previous value, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, `ans` is an integer increased by 1.**
