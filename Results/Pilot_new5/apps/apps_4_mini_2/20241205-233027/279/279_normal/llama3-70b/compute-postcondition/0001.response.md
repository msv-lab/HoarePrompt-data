The variable `p` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which converts a space-separated string input into a list of integers. The previous values of `p` are replaced by this new list based on the user's input. The length of `p` remains equal to `n`. Other variables, `n` and `b`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, both lists having a length of `n`.**
