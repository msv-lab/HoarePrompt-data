The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of binary values (0s and 1s) of length `n`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and counts how many of these cycles consist entirely of elements in `b` that are 0. If there is exactly one cycle, it prints `0`. If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of cycles with all zeros if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it prints `1`.
