Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values, `cycles` contains all cycles found during the iterations, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of `1` for each cycle where all `b[x] == 0` for `x` in that cycle. The current value of `cycles` has exactly one cycle.***
