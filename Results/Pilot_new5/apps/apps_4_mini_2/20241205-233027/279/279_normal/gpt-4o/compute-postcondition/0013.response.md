The operation `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the `cycle` list. The initial state indicates that `x` must be less than `n`, `cycle` is currently an empty list, and the other variables remain unaffected by this operation. After appending, `cycle` will contain the value of `x`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list with `visited[x]` equal to `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing the value `x`, `x` must be less than `n`.**
