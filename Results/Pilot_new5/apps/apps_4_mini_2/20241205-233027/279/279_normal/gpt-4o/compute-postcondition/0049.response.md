The code appends the value of `x` (which is 2) to the list `cycle`. Initially, `cycle` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `cycle` will now contain one element, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values for indices in the cycle starting from 1 but now `visited[2]` is `True`, `x` is 2, `cycles` is updated to include the newly appended `cycle`, `cycle` is a list containing the value 2.**
