Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length `n`, `visited` indicates that all indices reached during the loop are marked as `True`, `cycle` contains all the indices visited starting from 2 up to the first index that was revisited, `x` is the first index that caused the loop to terminate, and `cycles` has been updated to include the newly appended `cycle`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, the program will mark the path taken in `visited`, update `cycle`, and append it to `cycles`.***
