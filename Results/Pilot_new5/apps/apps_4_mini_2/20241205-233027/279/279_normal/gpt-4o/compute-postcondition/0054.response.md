Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `True` values for indices in the cycle starting from 1 with `visited[2]` as `True` and `visited[x]` as `True`; `x` is now `p[x] - 1`, updated to point to an index where `visited[x]` is `False`; `cycles` is updated to include the newly appended `cycle`, where `cycle` is now [2, x].**
