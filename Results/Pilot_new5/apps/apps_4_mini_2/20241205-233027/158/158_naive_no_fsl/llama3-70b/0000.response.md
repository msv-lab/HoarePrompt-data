Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are not enough fruits to create even a single complete set of the ratio 1:2:4. Specifically, if there are enough lemons and apples, but not enough pears, the program will still compute a total based on the minimum available fruits. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1
```
In this case, Nikolay has:
- 1 lemon (which can make 2 apples and 4 pears),
- 2 apples (which can make 1 lemon, but requires 2 apples),
- 1 pear (which cannot fulfill the requirement of 4 pears).

According to the problem description, Nikolay cannot make any compote because he does not have enough pears. The expected output should be `0`. 

However, the program would calculate:
```
min_lemon = min(1, 2 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 1, 0) = 0
```
Then it prints `0`, which in this case is correct, but if he had apples to spare, the output might not reflect that he can actually make a valid mix based on the ratios given.

Consider another input:
```
2
3
1
```
The expected output should again be `0` because there are not enough pears, and the program would similarly output `0`. 

However, it does not account for the total fruit count correctly when there are enough lemons and apples but not enough pears. Hence, while certain inputs yield `0`, the logic does not universally apply to check all conditions that define whether the fruits can be used in the required ratios.

Therefore, the program fails to comprehensively validate the ability to create the compote based on fruit availability in the required ratio, leading to incorrect calculations in some scenarios. Thus, the correctness is **False**.
