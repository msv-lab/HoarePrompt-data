The code snippet prints the value of `total_fruits`. The value of `total_fruits` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before the print statement. Specifically, `max_lemons` is determined by the expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, and then `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`. 

Since `total_fruits` is printed, it will hold a specific value depending on the inputs provided. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` are derived from those variables.

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is an input integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4), total_fruits` is equal to `7 * max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` is printed.**
