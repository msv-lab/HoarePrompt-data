The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each parameter represents the number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay has, respectively, and they are all positive integers satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any specific output as per the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integer parameters representing quantities of fruits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.**
