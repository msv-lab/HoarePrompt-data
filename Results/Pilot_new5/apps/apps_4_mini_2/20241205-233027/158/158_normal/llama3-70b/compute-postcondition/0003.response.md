The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can express `min_lemon` in terms of the variables.

The preconditions still hold:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer

Thus, `min_lemon` will be the minimum of the three expressions, which could yield a specific integer based on the input values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4.**
