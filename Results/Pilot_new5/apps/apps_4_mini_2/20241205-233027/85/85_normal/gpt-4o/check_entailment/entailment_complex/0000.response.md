Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Trailing Nines Logic**: The program attempts to compute the maximum number of trailing nines in `n` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 if `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. However, this logic is fundamentally flawed. It does not consider the sum of two distinct shovel prices and their potential to end in nines. Instead, it only calculates the number of trailing nines in `n` itself.

2. **Counting Pairs**: The program calculates `pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s`, which is not the correct approach to count pairs of shovel prices that sum to a value ending in the maximum number of nines. The problem requires finding pairs of shovel prices `i` and `j` such that `i + j` ends with the maximum number of trailing nines, not just counting the trailing nines of `n`.

3. **Example Cases**: For the input `n = 7`, the expected output is `3`, but the program incorrectly calculates the pairs based on `max_9s` derived from the wrong logic. The actual pairs should be derived from valid combinations of shovel costs that would yield sums ending in nines.

4. **General Misinterpretation**: The function does not implement the necessary logic to evaluate all possible pairs of shovel costs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` and check how many of those sums end with nines.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
