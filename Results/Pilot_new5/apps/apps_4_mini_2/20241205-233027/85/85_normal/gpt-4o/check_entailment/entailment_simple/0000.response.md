To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given `n`, the number of shovels, where the cost of each shovel is its index (1 to n).
2. We need to find pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum number of trailing 9s.
3. It is noted that pairs are different if they have at least one shovel in common.
4. The output should be the number of such pairs.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program attempts to count the number of trailing 9s in the number `n` by checking if `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This logic is flawed, as simply checking the last digit of `n + 1` does not help us determine the pairs of shovel costs that would yield the maximum number of trailing 9s in their sum.
2. The line `pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s` suggests that it is trying to compute the number of pairs based on the number of trailing 9s found, but this does not correlate with the problem requirements. The correct calculation for the number of pairs would require finding specific combinations of shovel costs that meet the criteria for having sums ending with trailing 9s.
3. The output does not address the conditions for counting all pairs correctly. The logic of summing `n + 1` multiplied by `max_9s` lacks justification based on the actual pairs of shovel costs, as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program has fundamental flaws in logic that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. It does not effectively identify or count the pairs of shovels leading to sums that end with the maximum number of trailing 9s. 

Thus, the answer is:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to implement the correct logic needed to solve the problem as required by the description.
