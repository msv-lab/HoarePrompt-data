Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, and calculates the number of trailing 9s in `n`. It returns the product of `(n + 1)` and the count of trailing 9s. If `n` has no trailing 9s, it will return the value of `n + 1` multiplied by 0, which is 0. The function does not return a value but prints the result. **
