The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value, but we know that `ans` will now be one greater than its previous value. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 6 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3, `ans` is increased by 1**.
