According to the code, the loop iterates over the integer range from 1 to \( n // 2 + 1 \). The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches \( n // 2 \).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i` is still less than or equal to \( n // 2 \). 

Since \( n \) is an integer such that \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), the minimum possible value of \( n // 2 \) is 2 when \( n = 4 \). 

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 3. We need to ensure that \( n // 2 \) is at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, \( n \) must be at least 6 (since \( 6 // 2 = 3 \)).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 6 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3**
