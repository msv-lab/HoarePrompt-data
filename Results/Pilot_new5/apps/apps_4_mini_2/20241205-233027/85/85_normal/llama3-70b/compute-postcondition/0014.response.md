The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the given constraints, it is noted that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no parameters to be passed into the function, the output behavior is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, without any explicit output details, we cannot ascertain the return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the output behavior is not specified.**
