According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The range for the for loop is from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least 2, because:

- If `n` is 2, `n // 2 + 1` equals 2, and the loop will iterate with `i` taking the value of 1.
- If `n` is greater than 2 (up to 10^9), the loop will iterate with values from 1 to `n // 2`.

Given that `ans` is 0 before the loop execution, it does not affect the loop's ability to run. Hence, the relevant states to adjust are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1**
