The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `ans`, but we can infer that it exists as a variable. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1.**
