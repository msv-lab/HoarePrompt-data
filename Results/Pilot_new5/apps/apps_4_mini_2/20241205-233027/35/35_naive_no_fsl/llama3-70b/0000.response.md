Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the way it decrements `x` without properly checking the distribution conditions leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 7 10
```
The expected output is `3`, as there are enough pieces in both cakes to distribute them such that each of the 4 plates has at least 3 pieces. However, the logic in the function may not appropriately handle scenarios where the remaining pieces on each cake must still satisfy the distribution constraints after the first few have been allocated.

To illustrate, the program starts with `x` as the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then enters a loop that reduces `x` and checks conditions on `a`, `b`, and their available pieces after one allocation, but it does not systematically consider how to maximize `x` while ensuring that each plate gets at least one piece. Thus, for certain inputs, it may return a number smaller than the optimal maximum possible `x`, leading to incorrect outputs.

Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect because it fails to consistently produce the expected results across all potential valid inputs, particularly in cases where the distribution must be optimized correctly.
