The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of complete pieces that can be made from two cakes (with sizes `a` and `b`) when each piece has a size of `x` is at least `n`. The function does not enforce any constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` outside what is expected by the user, such as ensuring `x` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`. Additionally, if `x` is 0 or negative, the division would lead to incorrect behavior, but this scenario is not handled in the code.
