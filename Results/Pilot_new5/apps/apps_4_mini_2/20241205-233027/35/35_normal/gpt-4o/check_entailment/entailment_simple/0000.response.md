To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the main function `func_1` and the helper function `can_distribute`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: Three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where:
   - `n`: Number of plates.
   - `a`: Number of pieces of the first cake.
   - `b`: Number of pieces of the second cake.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Each piece of cake must be distributed onto plates, with no plate containing pieces from both cakes.
   - Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
   - The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

### Program Analysis:
- **Binary Search Approach**: The program uses a binary search strategy to find the maximum value of `x`, where `x` is the minimum number of pieces on any plate.
- **Function `can_distribute(x)`**: This checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each of the `n` plates receives at least `x` pieces. The logic:
  - `a // x`: Number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from the first cake.
  - `b // x`: Number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from the second cake.
  - The check `a // x + b // x >= n` ensures that the total number of plates that can be filled meets or exceeds the required number of plates `n`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop in `func_1` runs while `low < high`. The condition `low = 1` and `high = min(a, b) + 1` means we are searching for possible values of `x` starting from `1` up to `min(a, b)`.
2. **Loop Execution**: Within the loop, the program checks whether the current midpoint `mid` can be a valid minimum (`x`) using `can_distribute(mid)`. If it can, it attempts to find a larger minimum by adjusting `low`. If it cannot, it reduces the upper bound `high`.
3. **Final Return**: After the loop, the function returns `low - 1`, which correctly gives the maximum `x` possible that satisfies the distribution conditions.
4. **Boundary Handling**: The constraints `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` are respected, ensuring the input is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements a binary search to determine the maximum minimum pieces of cake that can be placed on the plates while adhering to the distribution rules laid out in the problem description. It checks all necessary conditions, ensuring a correct and optimal solution.

Thus, the final output regarding the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
