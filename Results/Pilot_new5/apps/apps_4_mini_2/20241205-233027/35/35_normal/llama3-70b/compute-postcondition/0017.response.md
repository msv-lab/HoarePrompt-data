The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided definition. However, it operates under specific constraints on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` which are integers. The constraints are: `n` must be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` is an integer constrained to \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), and `b` is an integer constrained to \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). 

Since there is no output description provided, we cannot define specific return values based on the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is limited to these constraints without additional operational details.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), but does not specify any parameters or return values.**
