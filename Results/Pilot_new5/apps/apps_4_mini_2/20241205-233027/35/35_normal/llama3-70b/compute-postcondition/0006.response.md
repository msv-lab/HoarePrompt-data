The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The preconditions state that `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`. Since the conditions for breaking out of the loop are satisfied, they still hold true after `x` is decremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is decremented by 1.**
