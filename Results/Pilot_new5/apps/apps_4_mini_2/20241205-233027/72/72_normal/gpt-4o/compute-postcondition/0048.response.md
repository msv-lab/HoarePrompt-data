The `max_questions` variable is decremented by 1. The other variables retain their previous states and none of their values are affected by this operation. Therefore, the valid preconditions remain intact except for the updated value of `max_questions`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` are positive integers, `direction` equals 1 or -1, `row` is updated accordingly, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
