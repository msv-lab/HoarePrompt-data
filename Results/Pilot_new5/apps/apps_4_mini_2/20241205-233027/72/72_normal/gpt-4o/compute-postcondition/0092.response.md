The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `direction`, `row`, and `col`) remain unchanged. The state of the other variables is still valid after the execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `row` equals `n - 2`, `col` equals `m - 1`, and `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `row` equals `n - 2`, `col` equals `m - 1`, and `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`.**
