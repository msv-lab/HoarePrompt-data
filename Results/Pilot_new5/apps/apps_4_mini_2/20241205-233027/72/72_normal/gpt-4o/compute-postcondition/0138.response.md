According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we have `m` is greater than 0, meaning there are still columns to iterate over. The `col` is currently at its last value from the previous iteration, so it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `col` will be `1` more than its current value. Since `m` is greater than 0, and we have established that `col` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again, `m` must remain greater than `col`.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `direction` is unchanged, `max_questions` is unchanged, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `row` is unchanged, `col` is `col + 1`**
