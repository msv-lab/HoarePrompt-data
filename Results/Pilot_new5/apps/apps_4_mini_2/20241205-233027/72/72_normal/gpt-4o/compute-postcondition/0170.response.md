Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, which represent the number of rows, pupils per row, number of questions, and Sergei's position in the seating arrangement. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions Sergei could have answered, as well as the exact number of questions he answered during the questioning process. The function does not return any value but prints the maximum questions, minimum questions, and the number of questions Sergei answered after processing all the questions based on the given parameters. It correctly handles cases where `n` is 1 and performs calculations based on Sergei's row and column positions.**
