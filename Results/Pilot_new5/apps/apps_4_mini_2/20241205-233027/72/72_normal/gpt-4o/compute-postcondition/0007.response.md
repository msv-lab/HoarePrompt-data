To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step based on the initial state provided.

1. The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. Since `full_cycles` is defined as `k // full_cycle_length`, the value of `max_questions` will directly depend on the previously calculated value of `full_cycles`.
2. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `max_questions` and retain the existing definitions of all other variables.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input positive integer, `m` is assigned an input positive integer, `k` is assigned an input positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n = 1`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`, `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
