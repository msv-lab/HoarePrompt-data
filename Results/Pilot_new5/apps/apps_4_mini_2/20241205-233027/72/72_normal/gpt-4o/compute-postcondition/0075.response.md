The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions` is a positive integer increased by 1, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is 1, `row` is between 0 and `n-1`, `col` is 0.
