Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` is set to 0, and the current value of `direction` is -1, with `row` now equal to `n - 2`.***
