The variable `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, and `col` is now `col + 1`. The conditions for incrementing `sergei_questions` are not directly addressed by the executed code snippet. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, and only `max_questions` is affected.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `col` is now `col + 1`, `max_questions` is increased by 1**.
