You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row respectively (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), k is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), x is a positive integer representing the row number where Sergei sits (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and y is a positive integer representing the position of Sergei in the row (1 ≤ y ≤ m).
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycles` is equal to `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` equals 1, the else part does not apply, and the calculations related to `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are not executed.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. If `x` is 0 or `n - 1`, then if `n` is greater than 1, `sergei_questions` is calculated as `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is updated based on the expression `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`.
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `direction` is either 1 or -1; `row` is a value between 0 and `n-1`; `max_questions` is the total number of questions adjusted by the number of up and down movements; `sergei_questions` is the count of questions answered by Sergei during all iterations; `remaining_questions` is 0, indicating all questions have been processed; `_` is the total number of iterations (equal to the original `remaining_questions`); `col` will have iterated over all values from 0 to `m-1`.
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, which represent the number of rows, pupils per row, number of questions, and Sergei's position in the seating arrangement. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions Sergei could have answered, as well as the exact number of questions he answered during the questioning process. The function does not return any value but prints the maximum questions, minimum questions, and the number of questions Sergei answered after processing all the questions based on the given parameters. It correctly handles cases where `n` is 1 and performs calculations based on Sergei's row and column positions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
