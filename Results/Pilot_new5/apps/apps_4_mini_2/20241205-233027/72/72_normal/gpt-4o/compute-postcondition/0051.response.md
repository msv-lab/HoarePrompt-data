The value of `row` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `direction`, `max_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `_`, and `col` remain unchanged, while `row` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` must be greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` is 1; `row` is updated to its previous value plus 2; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` is 1; `row` is updated to `previous value of row + 2`; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 1.**
