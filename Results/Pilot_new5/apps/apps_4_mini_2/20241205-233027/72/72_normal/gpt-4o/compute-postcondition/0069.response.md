According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_questions`. If `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `col` is equal to `m`. We need to adjust `remaining_questions` to indicate one less question to be answered. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_questions` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `row` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, `max_questions` is a positive integer, `sergei_questions` is the count of questions answered by Sergei during the iterations, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is still 0, `col` is equal to `m`**
