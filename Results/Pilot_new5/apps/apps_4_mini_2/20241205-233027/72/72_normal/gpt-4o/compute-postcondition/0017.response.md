Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. If `x` is 0 or `n - 1`, then if `n` is greater than 1, `sergei_questions` is calculated as `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is updated based on the expression `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`.***
