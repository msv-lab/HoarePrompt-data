Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers greater than 1, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals -1, then `row` is updated to its previous value plus 2, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `direction` equals -1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `old_row - 2`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
