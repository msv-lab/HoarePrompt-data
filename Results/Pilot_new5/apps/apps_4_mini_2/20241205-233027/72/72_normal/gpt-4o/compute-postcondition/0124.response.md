The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `row`, `col`, `direction`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is unchanged, `col` is 0, and the current value of `direction` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is unchanged, `col` is 0, and the current value of `direction` is 1.**
