Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `direction` is either 1 or -1; `row` is a value between 0 and `n-1`; `max_questions` is the total number of questions adjusted by the number of up and down movements; `sergei_questions` is the count of questions answered by Sergei during all iterations; `remaining_questions` is 0; `_` is the total number of iterations (equal to the original `remaining_questions`); `col` will have iterated over all values from 0 to `m-1`; `min_questions` has not been defined in the initial state and would need to be set based on context. The output of the print statement will be `max_questions`, `min_questions`, `sergei_questions`.**
