The value of `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. The initial state mentions that `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`. Thus, `min_questions` is calculated based on the value of `full_cycles`, which is already derived from `k` and `full_cycle_length`. After the execution, the new value of `min_questions` will be the result of dividing `full_cycles` by `(2 * n - 2)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
