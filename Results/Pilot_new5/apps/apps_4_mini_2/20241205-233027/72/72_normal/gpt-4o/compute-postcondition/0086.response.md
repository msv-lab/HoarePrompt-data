The value of `row` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `row` is -1, after the operation `row += 2`, the new value of `row` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions` are positive integers decreased by 1, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is 1, `row` is 1, `col` is 0**
