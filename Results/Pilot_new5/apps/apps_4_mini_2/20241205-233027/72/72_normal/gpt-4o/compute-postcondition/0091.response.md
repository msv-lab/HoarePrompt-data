Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, while `remaining_questions` remains a positive integer, `direction` is -1, `row` equals `n - 2`, and `col` equals `m - 1.***
