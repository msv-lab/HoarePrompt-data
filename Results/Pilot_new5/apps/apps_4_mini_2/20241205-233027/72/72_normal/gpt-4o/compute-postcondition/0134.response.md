The value of `direction` is assigned 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. The previous conditions regarding `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `row`, `col`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. However, `direction` now equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is updated to `row + direction`, `col` is 0, `direction` equals 1, and `row` is equal to -1.**
