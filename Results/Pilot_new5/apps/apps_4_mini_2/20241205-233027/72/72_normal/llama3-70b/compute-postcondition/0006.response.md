Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of pupils per row, `k` is the total number of questions asked, and `x` and `y` represent Sergei's position in the seating arrangement. It calculates and prints three values: `max_asked`, which indicates the maximum number of questions asked per pupil based on rows, `min_asked`, which ensures that the minimum is at least 1, and `sergei_asked`, which reflects the number of questions asked specifically to Sergei based on his position. The function does not return a value but rather prints the results directly. **
