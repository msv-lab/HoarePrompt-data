To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the printed output.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer representing the number of rows.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils per row.
- `k` is a positive integer indicating the total number of questions asked.
- `x` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement.
- `y` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement.
- `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.
- `min_asked` is equal to `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`.
- `sergei_asked` is equal to `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`.

The code snippet executes:
```
print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```

This line prints the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. The values of these variables are determined based on the initial state and the formulas provided.

Since the code only prints values and does not modify any of the variables, the state of all variables remains unchanged except for the output values being calculated and printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows; `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils per row; `k` is a positive integer indicating the total number of questions asked; `x` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement; `y` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement; `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`; `min_asked` is equal to `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`; `sergei_asked` is equal to `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`; values printed are `max_asked`, `min_asked`, `sergei_asked`.**
