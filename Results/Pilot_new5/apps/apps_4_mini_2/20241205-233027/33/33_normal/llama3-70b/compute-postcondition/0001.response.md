The value of `curr_lat` is assigned the constant value of 90, which remains unchanged irrespective of the input value of `n`. The variable `n` is still within its defined range (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) but is not explicitly changed by the code snippet provided. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90**.
