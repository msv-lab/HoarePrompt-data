The command `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is not equal to 'South'.**
