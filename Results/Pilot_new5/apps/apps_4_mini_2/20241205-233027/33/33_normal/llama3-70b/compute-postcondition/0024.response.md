The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, no variables are modified and the program does not proceed further. The current state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; `dir` is not 'South' and the program execution is terminated.**
