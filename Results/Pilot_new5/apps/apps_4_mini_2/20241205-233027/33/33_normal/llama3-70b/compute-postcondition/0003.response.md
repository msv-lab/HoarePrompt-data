The values of `t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` which returns two values separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, and `dir` is an input value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**
