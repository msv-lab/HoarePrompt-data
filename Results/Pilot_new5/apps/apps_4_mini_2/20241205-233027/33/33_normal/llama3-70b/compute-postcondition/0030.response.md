The variable `curr_lat` is modified by subtracting `t / 111.195` from it. The value of `t` is derived from input and is therefore unknown, but it is an integer. The variable `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (exclusive of 1), and `dir` remains an input value that is unchanged. Since `curr_lat` is specifically mentioned in the operation, its previous value is not known, but it will be updated based on the calculation involving `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`.**
