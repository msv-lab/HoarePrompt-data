Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' is printed and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is within the valid range, the program continues execution without exiting.***
