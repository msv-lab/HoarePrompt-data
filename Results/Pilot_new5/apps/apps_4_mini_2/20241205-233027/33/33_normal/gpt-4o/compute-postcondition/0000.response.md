The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 remains valid. The states of the other variables (`t_i` and `dir_i`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `n` is an input integer**
