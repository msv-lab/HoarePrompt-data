Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of elements, and a list `a` of `n` strictly increasing integers. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the list based on a specific condition: for any subarray of `a` defined by indices `(i, j)`, it checks if the difference between elements is equal to their respective index differences. The function prints the maximum number of elements that can be erased, which could be less than or equal to `n-1`. If no elements can be erased based on the condition, it returns 0. **
