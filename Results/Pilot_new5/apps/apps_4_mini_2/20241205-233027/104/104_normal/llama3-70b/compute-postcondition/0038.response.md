Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` has iterated from 3 to `n`, and `max_erase` is the maximum number of elements that can be erased based on the conditions checked for all `j` in the range. If the condition holds for any `j`, where for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, then `max_erase` will contain the highest value computed during the iterations; otherwise, it retains its initial value.**
