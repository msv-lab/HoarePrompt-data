Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `max_erase` is the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the list `a` based on the conditions checked for all pairs of indices `(i, j)`, and `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` indicating the start of the erasure check. If no elements can be erased, `max_erase` remains 0.**
