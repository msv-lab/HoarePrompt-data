Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is either `max(max_erase, j - 1)` when all elements in the range from `i` to `j` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i`, ensuring that the difference between the elements in `a` and their corresponding indices is maintained. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made to the variables.***
