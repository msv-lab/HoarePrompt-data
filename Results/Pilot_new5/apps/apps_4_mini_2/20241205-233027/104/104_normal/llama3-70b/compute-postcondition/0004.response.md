To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop's structure and the provided state.

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
```

Here, `i` is initially 0, meaning that the starting point for `j` will be `i + 1`, which is 1. The ending point for `j` is `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n + 1` will be between 2 and 101.

Now, let's consider the implications:

1. The loop will execute if there are values for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, the range will be from 1 to `n + 1`, which contains at least one value (specifically 1).

2. The loop will therefore execute at least once since the minimum value for `j` will be 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be the last value in the range, which is `n`. 

Based on this analysis, here are the necessary adjustments:

- `j` should start at 1 (which it does given `i` is 0).
- The loop will iterate up to and including `n`.

Thus, we summarize the state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 0, `j` will start at 1 and go up to `n`**.
