The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is guaranteed to remain within the bounds of 1 to 100, as per the initial state. The variable `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `n` is an input integer.**
