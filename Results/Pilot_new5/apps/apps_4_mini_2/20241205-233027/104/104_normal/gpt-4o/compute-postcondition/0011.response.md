The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, indicating the number of elements in the list. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies the condition 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, which means the elements of the list are distinct and sorted in strictly increasing order. The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, so I will focus on the functionality based on the parameters provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` that specifies the number of elements in a list and a list `a` of `n` integers that are sorted in strictly increasing order, with each integer between 1 and 1000.**
