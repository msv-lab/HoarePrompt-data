Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`
- `max_erase` is updated to `max(max_erase, a[2] - a[1] - 1)`

Now, the code snippet provided is:

```
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

### Analyzing the Impact of the Code
1. The code updates the value of `max_erase`.
2. The index `i` is 3, so we will calculate `a[3] - a[2] - 1`.
3. The new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum of the current value of `max_erase` and `a[3] - a[2] - 1`.

The previous values that remain valid in the output state are:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `a` is still a list of `n` integers satisfying the conditions above.

### Output State Information
After executing the code, we update `max_erase` based on the above calculation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase is updated to max(max_erase, a[3] - a[2] - 1)`**
