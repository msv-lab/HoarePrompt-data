The variable `G_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the character 'G' found in the string `line`. The variable `line` remains unchanged, but `G_pos` now holds the integer value representing the position of 'G' within `line`. The initial conditions regarding `n` and `k` remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.**
