Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect. 

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Loop Direction**: The loop is designed to iterate from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k`, but it only checks positions starting from `G_pos` up to `T_pos`. It does not consider the possibility that `G_pos` could be to the right of `T_pos` initially (the check for range is correct, but the algorithm doesn't account for jumping in both directions).

2. **Breaking on Obstacle**: The program breaks out of the loop if it encounters an obstacle ('#'), but this behavior does not account for the fact that if the grasshopper jumps over certain cells (if `k` is large enough), it could still reach `T` even if there are obstacles in between, as long as the jump path does not land on a '#'.

3. **Unidirectional Check**: The code assumes that `G` is always to the left of `T` after the initial position swap, which limits the movement direction to just rightward jumps. Hence, it does not accurately reflect the problem's requirement to jump left as well.

### Counterexample:
- Consider the input `n=7, k=3` and line `T..#..G`. 
  - The grasshopper (`G`) starts at index 6 and `T` is at index 0. The function will not check the left direction since it only considers positions moving right from `G_pos` to `T_pos`. 
  - The correct behavior should allow jumping from index 6 to 3 (which is empty) and then to 0 (where `T` is located), but this is not evaluated by the program.

### Conclusion:
Due to these issues, the program fails to cover all scenarios required by the problem statement, thus it does not meet the requirements.
