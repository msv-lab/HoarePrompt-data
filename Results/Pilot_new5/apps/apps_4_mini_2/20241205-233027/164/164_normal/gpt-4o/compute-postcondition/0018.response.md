Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and if `line[pos]` is equal to '#', then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
