Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is equal to the position reached by advancing from `G_pos` in increments of `k` until `T_pos` or a '#' is encountered, and `reachable` is True, indicating that `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.***
