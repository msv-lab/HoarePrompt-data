The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `pos` still hold. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + 2k`, and if `line[pos]` is equal to '#', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `reachable` is True.
