The provided code simply prints 'YES' to the output. The variables and their values remain unchanged as no assignments or modifications are performed within the code. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print action occurred.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is equal to the position reached by advancing from `G_pos` in increments of `k` until `T_pos` or a '#' is encountered, `reachable` is True, indicating that `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
