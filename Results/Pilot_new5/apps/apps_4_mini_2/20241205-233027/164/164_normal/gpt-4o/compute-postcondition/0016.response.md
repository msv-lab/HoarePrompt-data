According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `k`. The loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with a step of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `pos` is `G_pos`, which is less than or equal to `T_pos`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` will be updated by adding `k` to it. Therefore, the new value of `pos` will be `G_pos + k`. The loop can continue as long as the new `pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need the following states:
- `pos` must be `G_pos + k`
- `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos - k` (to ensure the loop can continue).

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True if `pos` equals `T_pos`, otherwise it is False.**
