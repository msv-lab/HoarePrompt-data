Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. The problem description specifies that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly `k` cells away from its current position, with no restriction on whether the intermediate cells are empty or obstacles.

However, the code attempts to check for obstacles in the path of each jump using the condition:

```python
all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)
```

This line checks if every `k`-th step from the grasshopper's initial position to the target position does not encounter an obstacle. This is incorrect because the grasshopper can jump over obstacles, meaning that the algorithm should only check whether the destination cell (where the grasshopper intends to land) is clear of obstacles, rather than checking all the cells in between.

The correct logic should simply verify if the absolute difference in indices between 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`, without inspecting the intermediate cells. Therefore, the program fails to adhere to the stated rules of the problem description. 

For example, in the case where `n = 7`, `k = 3`, and the string is `T..#..G`, the grasshopper can jump from `G` to `T` despite the obstacle at index 3, but the current implementation would incorrectly determine that it's not possible.

Thus, the program does not accurately fulfill the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
