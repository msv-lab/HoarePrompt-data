The value of `g` is assigned the current value of `i`, which is 1. Other variables remain unaffected as they are not modified by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `g` while retaining the conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `g` is 1, `g` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', and `t` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'T'**
