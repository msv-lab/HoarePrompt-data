Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s` or remains -1 if 'G' does not exist; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s` or remains -1 if 'T' does not exist. The current value of `g` is -1 or the current value of `t` is -1.***
