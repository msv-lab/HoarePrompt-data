Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, such that `g` is not -1; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, such that `t` is not -1; the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and for every `i` in the range from 0 to (abs(t - g) // k), the character at the index `(g + i * k) % n` in string `s` is not '#'***.
