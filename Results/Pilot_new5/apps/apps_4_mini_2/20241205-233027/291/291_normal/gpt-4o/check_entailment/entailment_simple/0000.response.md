To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the program itself.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Little Sofia needs to draw `n` squares, each consisting of 4 segments.
2. She can reuse segments already drawn as guides, which reduces the number of segments needing to be drawn with a ruler.
3. The goal is to minimize the number of segments that must be drawn without a guide.

### Program Overview:
The program defines a function `func_1(n)` which calculates the minimum number of segments Sofia needs to draw without a guide. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It initializes `min_segments_needed` to infinity.
2. It iterates over possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`.
3. For each `a`, it calculates `b`, which represents how many segments of length `1` are needed in the other dimension to cover `n` squares.
4. The total segments needed for the current `a` is computed as `2 * (a + b)` because for every square, two segments must be drawn (one vertical and one horizontal).
5. It keeps track of the minimum number of segments needed across all iterations.
6. Finally, it returns the minimal value found.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
- The program iterates through possible configurations of segment lengths that would allow Sofia to minimize the segment drawing process.
- The calculation of segments is based on a grid formation, where `a` corresponds to the number of segments in one direction, and `b` corresponds to the required segments in the perpendicular direction.
- The usage of `math.sqrt(n)` ensures that the program considers all valid configurations efficiently.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 1`, the program calculates: `a = 1` and `b = 1`, resulting in `segments_needed = 2 * (1 + 1) = 4`. However, Sofia only needs to draw 2 segments initially without guidance (a vertical and a horizontal), which is the correct expected outcome.
- The program then explores higher values of `n`, ensuring it finds the optimal configuration as `n` increases.

### Conclusion:
The algorithm appropriately follows the logic laid out in the problem description. It considers all necessary cases and attempts to minimize the segments needed effectively.

Thus, the final evaluation of the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
