Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`; the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more; the current frequency of `unique_numbers[-1]` is equal to `n // 2`; the current frequency of `unique_numbers[-2]` is also equal to `n // 2`; the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`.**
