To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements
1. **Input Handling**: We need to read an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) followed by `n` integers (each between 1 and 100).
2. **Fair Game Condition**: The game is considered fair if:
   - Petya and Vasya can choose distinct integers.
   - All `n` cards can be claimed.
   - Both players end up with the same number of cards.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` and the subsequent `n` integers into a list `cards`.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: It utilizes `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each integer in the `cards`, storing the result in `count`.
3. **Unique Numbers**: It generates a sorted list of unique numbers based on their frequency.
4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If there are fewer than 2 unique integers, it prints `'NO'`, which is correct since distinct choices are required.
   - It checks if the two most frequent integers occur exactly `n // 2` times each. If true, it prints `'YES'` followed by those two integers; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

### Consideration of Edge Cases
- **Duplicate Cards**: If all cards are the same (e.g., input of `2 6 6`), the program correctly outputs `'NO'` since Petya and Vasya cannot choose distinct integers.
- **Insufficient Unique Cards**: If only one unique integer exists (e.g., input of `4 1 1 1 1`), it outputs `'NO'`, which is correct.
- **Sufficient Unique Cards but Uneven Distribution**: For cases where there are at least two unique cards, but the counts are not equal (e.g., input of `6 1 1 2 2 2 2`), it also correctly outputs `'NO'`.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description by ensuring that:
- It checks for the condition of distinct integers.
- It ensures that both players can completely claim the cards and have an equal number.
- It handles edge cases effectively by returning the appropriate results based on the conditions outlined.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
