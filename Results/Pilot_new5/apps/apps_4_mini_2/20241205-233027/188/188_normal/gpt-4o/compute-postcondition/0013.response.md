Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more and both frequencies of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are equal to `n // 2`, the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. If not, 'NO' is printed.***
