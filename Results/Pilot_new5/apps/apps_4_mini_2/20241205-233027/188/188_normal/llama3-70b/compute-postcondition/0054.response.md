The code prints the values of `a1` and `a2`. Since `a1` and `a2` are both keys in the dictionary `d` that correspond to the value `n // 2`, the output will reflect their values. The states of the other variables are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a1` is the first key in `d` such that `d[a1]` equals `n // 2; `a2` is the second key in `d` such that `d[a2]` equals `n // 2; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2; `d` is a dictionary containing counts of each unique integer from `a`; output 'YES' has been printed; `a1` and `a2` have been printed.**
