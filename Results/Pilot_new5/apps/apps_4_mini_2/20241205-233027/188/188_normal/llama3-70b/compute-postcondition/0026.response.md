The code snippet assigns the values -1 to both `a1` and `a2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` contains the counts of each unique integer in `a`, with keys being the unique integers from `a` and values being their respective counts, `c` is 0; `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` contains the counts of each unique integer in `a`, with keys being the unique integers from `a` and values being their respective counts, `c` is 0; `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1.**
