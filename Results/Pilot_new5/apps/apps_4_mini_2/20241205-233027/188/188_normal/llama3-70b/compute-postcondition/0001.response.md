`a` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, but it is not directly affected by the initialization of `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `n` while showing that `a` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a` is an empty list**
