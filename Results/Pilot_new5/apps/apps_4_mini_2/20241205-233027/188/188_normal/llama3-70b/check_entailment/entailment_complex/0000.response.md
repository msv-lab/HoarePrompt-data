Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine if Petya and Vasya can choose two different integers such that the game is fair according to the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Requirement of Distinct Integers**: The problem states that Petya and Vasya must choose different integers. The program checks that there are exactly two unique integers that appear exactly `n/2` times, but it does not ensure that these two integers are distinct. If the two integers that meet the criteria are the same, the game cannot be fair, and this case would not be handled correctly by the program.

2. **Example Case**: 
   - Consider the input case:
     ```
     4
     5
     5
     5
     5
     ```
     Here, there is only one unique integer (5), and it appears 4 times (which is `n`). The program would incorrectly find that there are no two integers that appear `n/2` times, leading to an output of "NO". However, there are no distinct integers available for Petya and Vasya to choose from, which violates the fairness condition.

3. **Missing Cases**: The program does not account for scenarios where there are two distinct integers, but their counts do not satisfy the `n/2` condition. For example:
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     1
     1
     2
     2
     3
     3
     ```
     The program would output "NO" but does not clarify that it is because there are not two distinct integers with the required counts. The output, therefore, lacks clarity in explaining why the game cannot be fair.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the chosen integers are distinct and does not account for cases where fair play is logically impossible despite meeting the count conditions. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
