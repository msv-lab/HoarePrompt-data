Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. If both `a1` and `a2` are valid keys in `d` such that `d[a1]` and `d[a2]` equal `n // 2`, the output 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. If either `a1` or `a2` is -1, the output 'NO' has been printed, while `c` indicates the count of unique integers in `a` that appeared exactly `n // 2` times, and `d` remains a dictionary containing counts of each unique integer from `a`.***
