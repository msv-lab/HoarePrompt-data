To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the code and the requirements systematically.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The function reads an even integer `n` (the number of cards) and then reads `n` integers representing the card values.
2. It counts the occurrences of each integer using a dictionary.
3. The code looks for exactly two unique integers that each occur exactly `n/2` times.
4. If such integers (let's call them `a1` and `a2`) exist, it prints "YES" and the two integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **All Cards Identical**: If all cards have the same number, e.g., `6, 6`, the output should be "NO", which the code handles correctly.
- **More than Two Unique Integers**: If there are three or more unique integers (e.g., `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`), the output should also be "NO". The code checks for exactly two integers, which is correct.
- **Exactly Two Unique Integers with Incorrect Counts**: If there are exactly two unique integers but they do not each occur `n/2` times, e.g., `10, 20, 10, 20, 10` (10 occurs 3 times, 20 occurs 2 times), it should output "NO". The current code may not handle this situation correctly since it only checks for counts of `n/2` for each unique integer and will fail to account for an instance where the counts do not match.

### Review of Output Hints
According to the output hints:
- The function correctly counts occurrences and checks if two numbers appear `n/2` times.
- The function does not handle input errors, which is noted in hints; however, since input is guaranteed to conform to problem constraints, this point may not be critical here.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for scenarios where there are exactly two unique integers, but they do not appear `n/2` times each. Specifically, it would output "YES" when it should output "NO" if the frequencies do not match the requirement.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1
2
1
1
```
The program would output "YES" with `1` and `2`, but it should output "NO" since `1` appears 3 times and `2` appears 1 time.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
