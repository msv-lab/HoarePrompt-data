The variable `a` is updated by appending the value of `int(input())`, which takes input and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` remains 0, but now `a` will contain one integer value provided by the input. The previous state of variable `a` was an empty list, so it will now contain one new integer value.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing one integer input.**
