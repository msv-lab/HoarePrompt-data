Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, and `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key (a unique integer from `a`). If `c` was initially 0, then `c` is updated to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and the current value of `d[i]` remains equal to `n // 2`. If `c` was not equal to 0, then `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `d[i]` is still equal to `n // 2`, with a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
