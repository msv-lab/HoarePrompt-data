Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`). If `c` is 0, `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
