According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be an even integer between 2 and 100, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute a certain number of times (specifically, `n` times). The variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The list `a` is initially empty, but that does not affect the loop execution directly. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to acknowledge the state of `i` at the start of the loop, which will be 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list**
