`a` is modified by appending a new integer input to the list. The variable `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, and `i` remains 2. The updated list `a` will contain its original integers plus the new integer input which will be denoted as `new_integer_input`. Therefore, the output state will include the original conditions of `n` and `i`, along with the new state of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the original integer and a new integer input**.
