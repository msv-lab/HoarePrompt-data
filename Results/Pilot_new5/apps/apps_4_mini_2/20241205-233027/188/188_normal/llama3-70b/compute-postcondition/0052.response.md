Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a1` is the first key in `d` such that `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, `a2` is the second key in `d` such that `d[a2]` equals `n // 2`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 indicating the count of unique integers in `a` that appeared exactly `n // 2` times, `d` is a dictionary containing counts of each unique integer from `a`. The current value of `a1` is not -1, and the current value of `a2` is not -1.***
