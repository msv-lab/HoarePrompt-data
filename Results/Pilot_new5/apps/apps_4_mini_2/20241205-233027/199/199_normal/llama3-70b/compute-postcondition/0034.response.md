`ways` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ways` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `ways` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `ways` is increased by 1.**
