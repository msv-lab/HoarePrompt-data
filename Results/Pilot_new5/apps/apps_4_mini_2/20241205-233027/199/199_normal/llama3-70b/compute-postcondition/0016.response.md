The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are not changed by this operation. The initial conditions remain valid, with `n` still greater than 4, `a` remaining 2, and `b` still beginning at 2 with the condition `2 * (2 + b) = n` holding true. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `ways` is incremented by 1, `a` is 2, `b` starts at 2, and it holds that `2 * (2 + b) = n`.**
