According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a` and `n`. The loop will iterate for values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is at least 3,
- `ways` is 1,
- `a` is 1,
- `b` is 1,
- `a` is not equal to `b`, and 
- `n` is equal to 2 times the sum of `a` and `b`, which implies that `n` must be equal to 4 if `a` and `b` are both 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented. In the last iteration, `b` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `b` should be 2. 

Now we also need to ensure that the upper bound for `b`, which is `(n - a) // 2`, allows for at least one more iteration. Since `a` is 1 and if `n` is at least 3, `(n - 1) // 2` needs to be greater than 2. 

Thus, to execute one more time:
- `b` will be incremented to 2.

The condition `a != b` still holds since `a` is 1 and `b` will be 2.

The states to reflect the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 2**
