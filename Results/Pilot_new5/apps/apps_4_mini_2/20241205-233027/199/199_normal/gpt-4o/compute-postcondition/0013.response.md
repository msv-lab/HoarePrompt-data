The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. Given that `a` is 2, `b` will be updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 4**
