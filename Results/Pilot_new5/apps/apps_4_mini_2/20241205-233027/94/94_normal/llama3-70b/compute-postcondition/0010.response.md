Given the initial state, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are lists containing two strings each: one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. This means that `puzzle1[i]` could be 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X' depending on the index of `i`. In the initial state, `i` is 1, so `puzzle1[1]` is either 'B' or 'X' (assuming a specific arrangement in `puzzle1`).

When the code `x2 = i` is executed, the value of `x2` is set to the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables `x1` and `x2` remain the same, as `x1` remains unchanged.

Since `x1` was initially set to 1 and `x2` becomes 1, we consider the overall impact:

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are lists of two strings each containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 1; `x1` remains 1; `x2` is 1.**
