`x1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `puzzle1` is a list of two strings containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `puzzle2` is a list of two strings containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 0; `current value of puzzle1[i]` is 'X'; `x1` is 0.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a list of two strings containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `puzzle2` is a list of two strings containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 0; the current value of `puzzle1[i]` is 'X'; `x1` is 0.**
