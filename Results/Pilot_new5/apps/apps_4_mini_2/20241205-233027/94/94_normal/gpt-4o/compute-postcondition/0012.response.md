The operation swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state`. Given that `empty_pos` is 3, and `new_pos` can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3, we need to consider each scenario for `new_pos`:

1. If `new_pos` is 0, then `new_state[3]` (which is 'X') is swapped with `new_state[0]` (which is 'A'), resulting in `new_state` being ['X', 'B', 'C', 'A'].
2. If `new_pos` is 1, then `new_state[3]` (which is 'X') is swapped with `new_state[1]` (which is 'B'), resulting in `new_state` being ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'].
3. If `new_pos` is 2, then `new_state[3]` (which is 'X') is swapped with `new_state[2]` (which is 'C'), resulting in `new_state` being ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'].
4. If `new_pos` is 3, then `new_state[3]` (which is 'X') is swapped with `new_state[3]` (which is also 'X'), resulting in `new_state` remaining unchanged as ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'].

Since `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 and the specific effect of the swap depends on its value, we can't definitively assign a single value to `new_state` without knowing `new_pos`. 

Thus, we state the possibilities for `new_state` based on the value of `new_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state` is either ['X', 'B', 'C', 'A'] if `new_pos` is 0, or ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'] if `new_pos` is 1, or ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'] if `new_pos` is 2, or ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'] if `new_pos` is 3.**
