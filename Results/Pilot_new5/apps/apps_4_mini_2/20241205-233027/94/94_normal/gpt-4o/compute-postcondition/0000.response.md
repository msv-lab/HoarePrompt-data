The code initializes the variable `queue` with a deque containing the `start` string. The variable `start` holds the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', which represent the tile configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle. The value of `queue` becomes a deque with the single element being the string `start`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`.**
