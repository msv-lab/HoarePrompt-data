According to the code, the loop iterates over the `directions` list, which contains four tuples representing possible movements. At the end of the last iteration, `current` is 'ABCX', and the loop has processed one of the direction tuples. 

To determine the new values needed for the next iteration, we need to know which direction was processed last. However, since this information is not given, we will assume that the next tuple in the list will be used for the next iteration. 

The `directions` list is indexed as follows:
- directions[0]: (-1, 0)
- directions[1]: (1, 0)
- directions[2]: (0, -1)
- directions[3]: (0, 1)

Since we need to execute the loop one more time, we can infer that the index of the next direction will be one step further than the current index. 

Assuming that the last processed direction was at index 0 (for example), the next direction would be at index 1, which is (1, 0). 

Given that `empty_pos` is 3 (the position of 'X'), and `new_row` and `new_col` need to be updated according to the current direction. If we've just moved in a vertical direction downwards (1, 0), then `new_row` would be 2, and `new_col` would still be 1.

However, since `new_row` can either be 0 or 1, we can just keep it as is for flexibility. Therefore, `new_pos` must be updated to reflect the new position after applying the movement, which could only be one of the four possible resulting states based on the applied direction. 

We can summarize the new states as follows:
- `empty_pos` is now affected based on the movement defined by the next direction in the loop.
- `new_state` must reflect the potential configurations resulting from the valid moves.

Thus for the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`, `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, and `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, with `new_state` being one of ['X', 'B', 'C', 'A'], ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], or ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']**.
