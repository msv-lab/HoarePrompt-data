The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, meaning it becomes a list containing the elements of the `current` state. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is `1 + dr`, `new_col` is `1 + dc`, `new_pos` is `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the elements of `current`.
