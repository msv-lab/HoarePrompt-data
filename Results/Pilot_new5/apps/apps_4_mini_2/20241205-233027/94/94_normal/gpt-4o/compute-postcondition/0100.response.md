The `queue` variable is updated by appending the value of `new_state_str`, which is 'ABXC'. The `visited` variable is also updated to include 'ABXC'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC', `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', `queue` now includes 'ABXC', `visited` now includes 'ABXC', `new_pos` is updated based on the calculations done.**
