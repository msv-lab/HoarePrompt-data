The `new_state_str` is added to the `visited` set, meaning that this state is now recorded as having been encountered. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is now `empty_row + dr`, `empty_col` is now `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is the concatenated string from `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited` before this operation but is now in `visited`.
