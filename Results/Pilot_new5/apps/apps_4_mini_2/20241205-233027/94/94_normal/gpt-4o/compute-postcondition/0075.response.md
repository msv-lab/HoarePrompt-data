Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, and `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`, while other variables remain unchanged. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
