To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and consider the values involved in the computation.

1. `new_row` is calculated as `empty_row + dr`, where `dr` is one of the possible row direction changes from the `directions` list.
2. `new_col` is calculated as `empty_col + dc`, where `dc` is one of the possible column direction changes from the `directions` list.
3. `new_pos` is then computed using the formula `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is 'ABCX'
- `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`
- `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`
- `directions` is a list with tuples indicating possible movements
- `current` is 'ABCX'
- `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 (the position of 'X' in the state)
- `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the previous state of `empty_row` and `empty_col`.

Since the exact values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Consequently, we cannot compute `new_pos` explicitly either. However, we can say that `new_pos` is calculated based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col` as described.

The output state will include all unchanged variables and indicate that `new_pos` is computed but without specific values.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
