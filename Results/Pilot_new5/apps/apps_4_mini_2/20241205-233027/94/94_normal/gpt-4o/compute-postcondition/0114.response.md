Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains all valid states reachable from 'ABCX' by moving 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves from 'ABCX'; `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. If all possible moves have been explored, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all unique valid states generated from swaps.**
