The provided code snippet swaps the values at the `empty_pos` and `new_pos` indices in the list `new_state`. The previous value at `empty_pos` (where 'X' is located) will be replaced with the value from `new_pos`, and vice versa.

- `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at the position of 'X' in the state.
- `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at the new calculated position to which 'X' will move based on `directions`.

After executing this code, the only variable that changes is `new_state`. The `empty_pos` now has the value that `new_pos` had before the swap, and `new_pos` now has the value that `empty_pos` had before the swap. 

The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is the modified list after swapping the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
