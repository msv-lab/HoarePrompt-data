The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. The initial state mentions that `new_state_str` is a string derived from `new_state` after swapping values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. 

Assuming `visited` is a set that is initially empty or contains some elements, the specific contents of `visited` are not known, but it will now include `new_state_str`.

Since no other variables are altered and the initial state remains valid aside from the updated state of `visited`, the Output State is: 

`start` is 'ABCX'; `new_state_str` is a string derived from `new_state` after swapping values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `new_state_str` is a string derived from `new_state` after swapping values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
