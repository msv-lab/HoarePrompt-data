The variables `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are assumed to hold specific values for this operation as they are not provided. The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC', `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', `visited` must include 'ABXC', `new_row` is calculated as `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is calculated as `empty_col + dc`.**
