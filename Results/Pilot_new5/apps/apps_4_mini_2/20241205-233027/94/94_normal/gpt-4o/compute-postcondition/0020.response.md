Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state` is one of ['X', 'B', 'C', 'A'], ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], or ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'].**
