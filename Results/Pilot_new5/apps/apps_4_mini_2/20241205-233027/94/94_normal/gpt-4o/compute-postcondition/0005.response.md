The `empty_pos` variable is assigned the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. The string `current` is equal to `start`, which is 'ABCX'. The index of 'X' in 'ABCX' is 3. Therefore, `empty_pos` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is 3.**
