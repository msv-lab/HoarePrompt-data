The value of `new_state_str` is assigned the result of the `join` operation on `new_state`, which combines the elements of `new_state` into a single string. The contents of `new_state` are derived from `new_state` having values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. The initial value of `start` is 'ABCX', and since `new_state` is a transformation of its previous values, it will create a new string representation.

Since `new_state_str` is derived from `new_state`, but no specific values for `new_state` were provided, we cannot determine the exact characters in `new_state_str`. However, we can confirm that `new_state_str` will be a string that corresponds to the updated state after the swap operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `new_state_str` is a string derived from `new_state` after swapping values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
