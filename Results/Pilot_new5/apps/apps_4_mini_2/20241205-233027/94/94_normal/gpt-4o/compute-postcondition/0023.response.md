The code performs a swap between two positions in the `new_state` list based on the calculated `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, while `new_pos` is determined by `new_row` and `new_col`. 

1. The variable `new_state` is initially `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`.
2. The `empty_pos` is used to identify one of the positions in `new_state` to swap with another position designated by `new_pos`.
3. After executing the swap operation, the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` will be exchanged.

Given that `empty_pos` can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and since `current` is 'ABCX', we can summarize the following:

- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `new_pos` is calculated based on the new row and column positions after movements indicated by `directions`.
- The specific values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on what `empty_row` and `empty_col` were prior to the swap.

After the swap, the `new_state` will be modified based on the specific swap performed.

The values of `visited`, `queue`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the result of swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`.**
