According to the code, the loop will execute for each direction in the `directions` list. The `directions` list contains 4 tuples, which means the loop can execute 4 timesâ€”once for each direction. 

Before the loop starts, we have the following states: 
- `start` is 'ABCX', 
- `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, 
- `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, 
- `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
- `current` is the last state removed from `queue`, 
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
- `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, 
- `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.

For the loop to execute properly:
- The `directions` list must contain valid directions for movement. This is already satisfied as `directions` contains 4 tuples.
- The `current` state must be valid, which has been established since it's the last state removed from `queue`.
- The `empty_pos` must be valid, which indicates the position of 'X' in the `current` state.

Since the `directions` already contains valid tuples, we do not need to adjust it. The other states appear to be sufficient for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states do not require specific adjustments beyond ensuring that the `current` state is valid and that the `directions` contain appropriate movements.

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is valid, `empty_col` is valid**
