To analyze the given program against the problem description, let's break down what the program is doing and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area, defined as \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The constraints are that:
- Each point must lie within the rectangle formed by \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\).
- The area must not only be an integer but also feasible to form a triangle with the given coordinates.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as \( \frac{n \cdot m}{k} \).
2. **Integer Check**: The program checks if the computed area is an integer. If not, it prints "NO".
3. **Zero Area Check**: If the area is zero, it also prints "NO".
4. **Point Calculation**:
   - If the area can be covered, the program checks if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m` to determine how to place the points.
   - The program prints three points based on these checks.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Area Calculation**: The formula used assumes that \( k \) divides \( nm \) evenly, which may not always provide a valid triangle area.
2. **Point Location Logic**: The logic for defining the points to print could lead to cases where the points do not actually form a triangle with the required area. For example:
   - If `area` is positive and valid, but the calculated points do not align properly to actually form a triangle since they may be collinear.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider an edge case for inputs:
- **Input: `1 1 2`**. Here \( n=1, m=1, k=2 \):
   - The area will calculate as \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer. This should lead to "NO", which is correct.
  
- **Input: `1 1 3`**. Here \( n=1, m=1, k=3 \):
   - The area will calculate as \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \). This should lead to "NO", which is also correct.
  
- **Input: `2 2 2`**. Here \( n=2, m=2, k=2 \):
   - The area will calculate as \( \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2} = 2 \), which is an integer. 
   - The points generated could be (0,0), (2,1), and (0,1) which gives a collinear arrangement and thus does not form the triangle correctly.
  
- **Input: `2 3 2`**. Here \( n=2, m=3, k=2 \):
   - The area will be \( \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2} = 3 \).
   - Using point generation logic could also lead to improper points formation.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program does not guarantee valid triangle formation for all valid area inputs, especially in cases where generated points could lead to collinearity.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for all edge cases where the triangle might not exist, or the points might not form a triangle with the required area even if the calculations for area appear valid.
