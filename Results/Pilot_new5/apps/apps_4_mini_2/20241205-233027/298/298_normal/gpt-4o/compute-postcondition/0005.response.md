The value of `area` is reassigned to `int(area)`, which means it will be the integer value of itself. Since `area` is already defined as `n * m / k` and stated to be an integer, the value will remain unchanged after this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` remains an integer.**
