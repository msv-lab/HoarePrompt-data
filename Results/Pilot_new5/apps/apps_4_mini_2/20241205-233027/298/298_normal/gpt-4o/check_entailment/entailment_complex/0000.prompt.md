You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is greater than `n`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `2 * area` is greater than `m` and the printed output is `0 {m // 2}`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within their specified ranges. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the printed output is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the printed output is `0 {m // 2}`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between their specified limits. If `area` equals 0, then `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is within bounds for `m`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within their specified limits. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' is printed. If `area` equals 0, then `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is within bounds for `m`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` through user input, calculates the area as `(n * m) / k`, and checks if this area is a positive integer. If the area is not an integer or is zero, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a positive integer, it prints 'YES' and provides coordinates based on the value of `2 * area`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints coordinates `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`; if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`; otherwise, it prints `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
