The code prints the values of `n` and `m // 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is simply being output. The value of `m // 2` is computed, where `m` is divided by 2 using integer division. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the values of `n` and `m // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and `2 * area` is greater than `m`; the printed output is `{n} {m // 2}`.**
