The code `print('0 0')` outputs the string '0 0' to the console. It does not modify any variables or change any state. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged in this execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, and `area` is not equal to 0; output '0 0' is printed.**
