#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer in the range 2 to 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer in the range 0 to 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs bitwise XOR operations on the variables `a` and `b` using the value `x`, but it does not take any parameters or return any values. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not defined within the function, leaving the behavior of the function ambiguous. Therefore, the function's specific functionality cannot be determined accurately based solely on the provided code.
