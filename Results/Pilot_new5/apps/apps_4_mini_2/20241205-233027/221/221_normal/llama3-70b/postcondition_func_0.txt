The function accepts two positive integers `s` and `x` (input via standard input), where `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. It calculates the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a < s`, `b = s - a`, and `a ^ b = x`. Finally, it prints the count of such pairs. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
