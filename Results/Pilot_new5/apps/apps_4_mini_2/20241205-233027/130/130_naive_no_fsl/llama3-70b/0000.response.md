Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the conditions laid out in the problem description. 

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
1. The program checks if both `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L` are satisfied, and if they are, it outputs `1`. If either of these conditions is false, it outputs `-1`. 

2. The condition `M >= N - K + 1` means that the number of friends must be at least as large as the number of different coins that could potentially be gifts. However, this does not account for the fact that every friend must gift the same number of coins that must also satisfy the constraints. 

3. For instance, consider the case:
   - Input: `N = 5, M = 3, K = 2, L = 3`
   - Here, Ivan has 2 coins already, and there are 5 different types of coins. 
   - The number of new coins that must be gifted is 3 (L = 3). 
   - The friends can only gift coins from the remaining 3 coins that could potentially be new (5 total - 2 existing = 3).
   - However, with 3 friends, each giving at least 1 coin, they cannot meet the requirement of 3 new coins, as they would only be able to give 3 total coins (one from each friend) and all of them must be new. 

In this example, the conditions are not met, but the program would incorrectly output `1`, indicating that one coin per friend is sufficient. 

Thus, the logic is flawed, and the program fails to evaluate the conditions comprehensively.
