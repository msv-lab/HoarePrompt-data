The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are replaced by the integers provided as input. The previous constraints state that `1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18`, so after mapping input values to these variables, they will still satisfy their respective constraints, but their specific values will change according to the input.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers assigned from input values such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18.**
