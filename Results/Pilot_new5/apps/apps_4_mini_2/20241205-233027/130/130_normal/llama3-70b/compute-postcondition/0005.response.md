Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then the integer 1 has been printed. Otherwise, it holds that `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L.***
