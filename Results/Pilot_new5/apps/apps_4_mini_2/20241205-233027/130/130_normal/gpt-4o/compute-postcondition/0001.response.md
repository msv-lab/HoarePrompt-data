The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned based on the input read from `sys.stdin.read()`, which is subsequently split and converted to integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are unknown, but they will be replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that these variables now hold the new integer values from the input.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned new values from input, where 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18.**
