To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets all the requirements specified.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `N`: total different collectible coins.
   - `M`: number of friends.
   - `K`: number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: minimum new coins that must be gifted.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Each friend must give the same number of coins.
   - All coins given must be different.
   - At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Calculation of Minimum Coins per Friend**:
   - The calculation of `min_x` is done using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which ensures that the total number of new coins to be gifted is at least `L`. This effectively distributes the new coins across `M` friends.
  
2. **Check for Feasibility**:
   - The condition `M * min_x <= N - K` checks if the total number of coins each friend gives (which is `M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of new coins available (`N - K`). If this condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to meet the conditions.

### Verification of Requirements:
- The program ensures that the coins given are different by maintaining the condition that `M * min_x` must not exceed the available new coins `N - K`.
- If the number of friends `M` exceeds the total number of collectible coins `N`, it directly leads to an impossibility condition, which is correctly handled by the inequality check.
- The calculation of `min_x` guarantees that it distributes the minimum required new coins evenly among all friends.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It accurately calculates the minimum number of coins each friend can gift while adhering to the constraints set forth in the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, we can confidently say:

Correctness: **True**
