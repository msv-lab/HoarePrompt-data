Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \). The logic in the function seems to be attempting to count factors of \( n \), which does not relate to finding the weights of splits defined in the problem description. 

For example, if we consider \( n = 7 \):
- The splits include: 
  - Weight 1: [7]
  - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1]
  - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1]
  - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  
The expected output for \( n = 7 \) is 4, but the program counts the factors of 7, which are 1 and 7, incorrectly leading to a wrong count of weights.

Another example for \( n = 8 \):
- The expected weights of splits are: 
  - Weight 1: [8]
  - Weight 2: [4, 4]
  - Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
  - Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
  - Weight 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  
The expected output for \( n = 8 \) is 5, but again the program would produce an incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
