Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of an integer \( n \) based on specific conditions. However, the provided function `func_1` counts the number of divisors of \( n \) rather than the number of distinct weights of splits of \( n \). 

For example, let's consider \( n = 7 \):
- The valid splits for \( 7 \) and their weights are:
  - Weight 1: [7]
  - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1]
  - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1]
  - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
This yields 4 distinct weights.

However, if we input \( n = 7 \) into the program, the function will return 4 (as it counts the divisors 1, 7) but it is not calculating weights of splits.

For \( n = 8 \):
- The valid splits for \( 8 \) and their weights are:
  - Weight 1: [8]
  - Weight 2: [4, 4]
  - Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
  - Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
  - Weight 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
This yields 5 distinct weights.

The program incorrectly returns the number of divisors instead of the distinct weights of splits. Thus, it fails to adhere to the problem's requirements, leading to an incorrect implementation.
