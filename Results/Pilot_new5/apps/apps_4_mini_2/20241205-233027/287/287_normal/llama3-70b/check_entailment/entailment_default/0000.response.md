The problem description asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the provided program does not address this requirement. Instead, the program calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) and does not consider the weight of the splits, which is a completely different task.

The code iterates through integers up to the square root of \( n \), counting both divisors \( i \) and \( n/i \) when \( n \) is divisible by \( i \). The output hints confirm that the function returns the total number of divisors of \( n \), which is not aligned with the problem description regarding different weights of splits.

To illustrate the discrepancy, consider the example where \( n = 8 \):
- The correct answer based on the problem description is 5, as given in the examples.
- However, if you run the provided code with the input 8, it would compute the number of divisors, which is 4 (since the divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8). This result does not correspond to the expected output regarding the weights of splits.

Given that the code does not follow the problem description in any case, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
