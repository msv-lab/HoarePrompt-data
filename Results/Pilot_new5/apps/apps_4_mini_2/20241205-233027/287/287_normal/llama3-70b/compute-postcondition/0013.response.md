Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9. If `i * i` equals `n`, then `res` is decreased by 1. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and `res` is updated to `res + 2`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is still incremented to `i + 1` and `res` remains unchanged.***
