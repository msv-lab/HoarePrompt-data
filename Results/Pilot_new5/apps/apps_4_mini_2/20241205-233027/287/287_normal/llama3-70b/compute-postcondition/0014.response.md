According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5)`, inclusive. The end condition for the loop depends on the square root of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
- The value of `i` must have been less than or equal to \( \text{int}(n^{0.5}) \). 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`, and this must still be less than or equal to \( \text{int}(n^{0.5}) \).

Therefore, the new state must reflect that `i` is now one greater than its previous value, and we need to ensure that it stays within the limit defined by \( \text{int}(n^{0.5}) \).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`**
