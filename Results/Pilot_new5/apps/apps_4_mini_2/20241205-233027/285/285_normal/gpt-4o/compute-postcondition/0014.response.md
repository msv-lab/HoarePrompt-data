According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. The loop iterates from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `b` must be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, where `b` is at its maximum for the current iteration, `b` would be equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Thus, we must ensure that `remaining_after_houses` still allows for one more car based on the `car_cost`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, remaining_after_houses must be at least (car_cost * (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)), b is (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)**
