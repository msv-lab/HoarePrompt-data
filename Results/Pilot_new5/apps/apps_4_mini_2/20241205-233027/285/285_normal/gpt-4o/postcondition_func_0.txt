The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if it's possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers such that the total cost exactly matches `n`. It returns 'YES' if such a combination exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'. Specifically, it iterates through possible numbers of houses and cars, and checks if the remaining amount can be fully spent on computers. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than the cost of a single computer; in those cases, it will return 'NO' without checking for combinations.
