The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the execution of the program. The variable values do not change, but the program will end without returning any further output.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2599580; `a` is 2; `b` is 1; `c` is calculated as `(n - 2592580) // 1234; the program has terminated.**
