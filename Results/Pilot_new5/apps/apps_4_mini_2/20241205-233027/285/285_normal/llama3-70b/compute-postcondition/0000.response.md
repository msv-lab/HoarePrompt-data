`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is still a positive integer, but its specific value is now determined by user input, which is unknown at this time. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
