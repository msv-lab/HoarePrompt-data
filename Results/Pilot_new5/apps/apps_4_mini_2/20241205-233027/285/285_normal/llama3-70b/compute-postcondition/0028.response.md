The code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables along with the information that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is at least `1358023`, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1358023) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
