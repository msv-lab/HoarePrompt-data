The `exit()` statement terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but the program execution stops.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `n // 1234`, and 'YES' is printed; the program execution is terminated.**
