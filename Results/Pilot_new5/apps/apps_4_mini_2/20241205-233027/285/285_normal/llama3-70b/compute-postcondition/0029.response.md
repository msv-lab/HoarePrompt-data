The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, none of the variables will change their values, and the state of the program is unaffected in terms of variable values. The only action taken is the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is at least `1358023`, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1358023) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed, and the program is terminated.**
