Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `a` is 0, `b` is equal to `(n - 0 * 1234567) // 123456`, `c` is equal to `(n - 0 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. The loop will execute while it is possible for `c` to be non-negative such that the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, determining whether 'YES' is printed and the program execution is halted.**
