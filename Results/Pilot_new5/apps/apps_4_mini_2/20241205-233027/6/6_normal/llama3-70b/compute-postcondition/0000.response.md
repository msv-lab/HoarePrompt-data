The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are assigned values from `input()`, which will be taken as integers. The specific values of these variables are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact values post-execution. However, the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will be updated with the integers from the input in the range specified by the conditions (1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `pos` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), `r` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ r ≤ n)**
