The function accepts four integers: `n` (total number of tabs), `pos` (current cursor position), `l` (left index of the segment that needs to remain open), and `r` (right index of the segment that needs to remain open). It prints the minimum number of moves required to close the tabs outside the segment [l, r], based on the current cursor position. If the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is to remain open, it returns 0. If `l` is 1, it computes the distance from `pos` to `r` and adds one. If `r` is n, it computes the distance from `pos` to `l` and adds one. If both `l` and `r` are within the bounds of the tabs, it calculates the moves to both ends of the segment and takes the minimum total move required to close the remaining tabs. All inputs are constrained to valid ranges.
