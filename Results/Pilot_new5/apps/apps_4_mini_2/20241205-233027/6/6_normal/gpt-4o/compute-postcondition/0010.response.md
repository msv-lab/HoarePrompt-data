The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, calculated as `abs(pos - l)`. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not directly altered by this operation, and they remain within their defined ranges. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `l` is greater than 1 or `r` is less than n; and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to abs(pos - l).**
