Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); either `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n`.***
