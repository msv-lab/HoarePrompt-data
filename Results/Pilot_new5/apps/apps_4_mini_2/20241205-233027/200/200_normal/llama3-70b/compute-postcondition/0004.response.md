To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the loop: `low < high`. 

Given the provided state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)
- `s` is a positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12)
- `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9)
- `low` is initialized to 0
- `high` is initialized to `min(v)`

For the loop `while low < high` to execute, we need to ensure that `low` is indeed less than `high`. 

Since `low` is initialized to 0 and `high` is initialized to `min(v)`, if `min(v)` is greater than 0, then `low < high` will hold true. Given that `v` contains positive integers, `min(v)` will always be at least 1. Thus, `low` which is 0, will always be less than `high` (which is `min(v)`), satisfying the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the state variables since `low` (0) is less than `high` (at least 1).

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a sorted list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9), `low` is 0, `high` is min(v)**
