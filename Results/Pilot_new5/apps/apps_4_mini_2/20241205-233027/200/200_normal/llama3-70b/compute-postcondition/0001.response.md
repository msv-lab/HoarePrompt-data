The variable `v` is assigned a new list of integers created by mapping the input values to integers. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `v` do not change except for `v`, which is updated to contain the input integers as a list. `n` remains the same, but `v` now specifically holds the values input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9) based on input.**
