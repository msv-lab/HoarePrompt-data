The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `s`, and a list `v` of `n` positive integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. It determines the maximum volume of kvass that can be uniformly distributed from the kegs such that the total volume is exactly equal to `s`. If it is not possible to achieve exactly `s`, the function prints `-1`. If it is possible, it prints the maximum uniform volume.
