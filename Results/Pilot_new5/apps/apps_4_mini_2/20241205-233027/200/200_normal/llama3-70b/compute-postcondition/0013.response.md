The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` must be known to determine the exact value of `mid`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`, `low` must be less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`, `low` must be less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`.**
