Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9), `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `0`, `i` is 0; if `remaining_kvass` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
