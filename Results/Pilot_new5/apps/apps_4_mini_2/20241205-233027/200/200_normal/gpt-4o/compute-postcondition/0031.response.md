The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, but it does exit the most internal loop or if statement in which it is contained. Therefore, we maintain the current values of all variables while noting that we are breaking from the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000) that must be greater than 2; `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12); `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9); `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `remaining_kvass` is less than or equal to `0`; `i` is 2; if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is equal to `volumes[2] - volumes[0]`, which is non-negative; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
