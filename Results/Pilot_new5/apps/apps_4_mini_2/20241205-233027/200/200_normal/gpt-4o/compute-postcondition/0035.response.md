The value of `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting the expression `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. The value of `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 1000. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9), `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `n` after the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9), `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
