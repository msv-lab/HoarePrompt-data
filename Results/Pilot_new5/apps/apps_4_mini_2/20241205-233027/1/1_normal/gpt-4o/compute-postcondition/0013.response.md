The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 2, `ind` will also be 2 after the assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
