According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can continue.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `ind` is -1**
