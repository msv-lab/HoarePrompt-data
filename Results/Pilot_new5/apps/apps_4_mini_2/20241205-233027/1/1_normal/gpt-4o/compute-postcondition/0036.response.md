According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `ind` and `bind`. The loop will execute if `ind + 1` is less than `bind`, which ensures that there is at least one valid iteration. 

Given the current states:
- `ind` is a valid index (not -1)
- `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' (also not -1)
- `ind` is less than `bind`

Since `ind` is less than `bind`, the expression `ind + 1 < bind` must hold true for the loop to execute. In the current state, we already have `ind` less than `bind`, but we need to verify that `ind + 1` is also less than `bind`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute:
- We need to adjust `i` to reflect the first value of the loop, which will be `ind + 1`.

Given these considerations, the states can be defined as follows:

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `i` is `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' or -1 if ']' is not present in `s`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is -1**
