The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n - 2`, which means `bind` will also be `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is -1 or a valid index, `i` is `n - 2`, and `bind` is equal to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is -1 or a valid index, `i` is `n - 2`, `bind` is `n - 2`**
