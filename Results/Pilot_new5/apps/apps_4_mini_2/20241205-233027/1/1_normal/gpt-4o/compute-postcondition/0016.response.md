To analyze the final output state of the program after the execution of the loop, let's summarize the behavior of the loop based on its code.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` until it finds the character '['. At that point, it sets the variable `ind` to the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

Given this understanding, we can determine the output state based on the possible scenarios:

1. **If `s` contains the character '[':**
   - The loop will execute until it encounters the first occurrence of '['. If the index of that character is `k`, then `ind` will be set to `k` after `k + 1` iterations (since indexing starts at 0).
   - The value of `i` will be `k` and `ind` will be `k`.
   - The loop will execute a maximum of `n` times, but it will stop earlier if it finds '['.

2. **If `s` does not contain the character '[':**
   - The loop will execute `n` times with `ind` remaining as `-1` since it will not find the character '[' in any of the iterations.
   - The value of `i` will reach `n - 1` (the last index).

Now, considering both cases, we can frame the final output state accordingly:

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s` (a positive integer between 1 and 500000), `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' if it exists, otherwise `ind` is -1, `i` is the last index checked (either `ind` if '[' was found or `n - 1` if not found).**
