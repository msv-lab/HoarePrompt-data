The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `i` is `ind + 3`, `start_colon` is `ind + 3`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
