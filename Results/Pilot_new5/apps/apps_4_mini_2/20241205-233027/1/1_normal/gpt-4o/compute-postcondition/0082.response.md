Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, and if `start_colon == -1` or `end_colon == -1` or `start_colon >= end_colon`, the output is -1. Otherwise, `end_colon` is at least `start_colon + 2`, `pipe_count` is 0, `i` is equal to `end_colon`, `result` is 4, and the value 4 has been printed.***
