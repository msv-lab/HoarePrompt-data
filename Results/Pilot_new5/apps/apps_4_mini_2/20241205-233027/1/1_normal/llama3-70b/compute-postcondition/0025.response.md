The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 1); `f` remains True; `i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is equal to `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
