Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |. If `s[i]` is equal to ']', then `f`, `bind`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is equal to ':' and `f` is True, then `bind` is set to `n - 2` (the same as `i`), which leads to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
