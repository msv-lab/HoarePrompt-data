The value of `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n`, `i` is 0, `ind` is now 0, `f` is True, and the character at index `i` (which is 0) is ':'.
