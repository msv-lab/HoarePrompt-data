The variable `bind` is assigned the value `-1`. Since the initial state indicates that `ind` would be updated based on the conditions given for the string `s` (involving `[` and `:`), but the code does not reference `ind` or modify `f`, the values for `ind` and `f` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n`; `bind` is -1.**
