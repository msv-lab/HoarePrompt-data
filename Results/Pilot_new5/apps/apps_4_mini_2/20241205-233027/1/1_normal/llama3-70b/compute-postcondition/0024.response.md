The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, meaning that `i` will now hold a value that is one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 1); `f` remains True; `i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is equal to `i + 1`**.
