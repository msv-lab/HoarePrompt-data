To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and determine whether it fulfills all specified requirements. 

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `k > n`. If it is, the output is 'No', since we cannot split a number `n` into more than `n` components of at least `1` (or negative numbers).
3. **Bit Extraction**: It identifies which powers of `2` (represented as bits) are present in `n` by checking each bit from `60` down to `0`. The indices of set bits are stored in the list `bits`.
4. **Length Check**: If the length of `bits` (the number of distinct powers of `2` that sum up to `n`) exceeds `k`, it returns 'No'.
5. **Expansion of Bits**: The program then tries to expand the `bits` list to exactly `k` elements by taking the smallest power and splitting it into two smaller powers (by subtracting `1` from it).
6. **Sorting and Output**: Finally, it sorts the `bits` in descending order and formats the result for output.

Next, we need to think of potential cases where the program might fail:

1. **Case where `n` is less than `k`**: This is handled correctly.
2. **Case where `n` is a power of 2**: For instance, `n = 8` and `k = 4`. The program finds `3` (since \(2^3=8\)), then it would need to split `3` into `4` items. The correct output would be `3, 1, 1, 1` (or any variation that meets the conditions), but the program will return 'No' because there’s only one `3`. So it's not wrong in terms of logic here.
3. **Negative powers of 2**: The description allows negative powers of 2, but the current logic does not explicitly check if there aren’t enough bits to split further. For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program correctly identifies `0` and `1` from `2^0`, but it fails to account for the need to represent this as `-1, -1`, which is acceptable as per sample inputs.

Given these observations, the program fails to handle the case where it can generate a valid sequence that includes negative powers of 2. Hence, it does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Therefore, the output for the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails in the case where `n = 1` and `k = 2` by not producing the output `Yes` followed by `-1 -1`, as required by the problem statement.
