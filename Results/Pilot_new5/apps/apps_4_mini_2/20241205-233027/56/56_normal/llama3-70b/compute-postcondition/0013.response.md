The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The variable `n` remains unchanged in this execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` while retaining the status of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is now equal to its previous value minus `2`; `i` is increased by 1**
