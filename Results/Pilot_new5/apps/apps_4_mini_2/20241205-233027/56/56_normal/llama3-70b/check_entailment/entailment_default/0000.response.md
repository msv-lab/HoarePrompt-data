To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of each integer equals `n` and ensure that the largest integer in the answer is minimized. If there are multiple valid answers, the one that is lexicographically largest should be returned. If it's not possible to create such a sequence, the output should be "No".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `n < k`. If true, it outputs "No" because it's impossible to have `k` distinct integers that sum to `n` if `n` is less than `k`.
3. **Finding Powers of 2**: It uses a while loop to find the powers of `2` that can be used to construct `n`. The loop continues until `n` is greater than `0` and finds the largest power of `2` that can be subtracted from `n`.
4. **Length Check**: After gathering the powers, it checks if the number of found powers is less than `k`. If so, it outputs "No".
5. **Final Output**: If enough powers are found, it sorts them in descending order and prints "Yes" along with the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case with k very large compared to n**: For example, `n = 1` and `k = 2` should return "Yes" and the sequence `-1 -1` is valid; however, the logic to push negative powers is not well established in the code.
2. **Minimum values of n and k**: When both `n` and `k` are at their minimum bounds (e.g., `n = 1`, `k = 1`), it should return "Yes" and output `0`.
3. **Possible sequences**: For certain configurations, such as `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the program should return "Yes" and indicate `1` (since `2^1 = 2`).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that the function should print "Yes" and the `k` largest powers of `2` used, sorted in descending order. They mention directly checking for the possibility of expressing `n` as a sum of exactly `k` distinct powers of `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all scenarios correctly. Specifically:
- The code fails to handle cases where negative exponents of `2` are required to fill up `k`, as seen in the case of `n = 1` and `k = 2` should output `-1 -1`.
- The logic does not cover the needed sequence correctly when `n` can only be expressed with negative powers of `2`.

Thus, upon review of the code and considering the potential edge cases, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
