The variable `smallest` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `bits`, which is removed from the list due to the `pop()` method. The list `bits` will now have one fewer element, and the remaining elements will still contain the indices of the set bits in `n`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged and maintain their previous states. 

Output State: **`bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits in `n` without the last element, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than `len(bits)`**.
