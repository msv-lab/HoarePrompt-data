The code appends the value of `i` (which is 59) to the list `bits`. The other variables (`n`, `k`) remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated `bits` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `bits` is a list containing 59, `i` is 59**
