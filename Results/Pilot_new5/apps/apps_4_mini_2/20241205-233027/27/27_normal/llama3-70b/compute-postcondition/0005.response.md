The variable `a5` is assigned the value of `y` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers within the range of 0.1 to 200.0, but their specific values are not provided. Thus, the output state incorporates the updated information for `a5`, while retaining the constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as the definitions of `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y * z`; `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z * y`; `a5` is equal to `y ** (x ** z)`.**
