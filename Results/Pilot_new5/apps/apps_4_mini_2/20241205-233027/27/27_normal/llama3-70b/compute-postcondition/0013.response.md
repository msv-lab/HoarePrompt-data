Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y * z`; `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z * y`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `y`; `a9` is equal to `z`; `a10` is equal to `z` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `x`; `a11` is equal to `z` raised to the power of `x * y`; `a12` is equal to `(z`. The array `a` is now defined as `a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]`.**
