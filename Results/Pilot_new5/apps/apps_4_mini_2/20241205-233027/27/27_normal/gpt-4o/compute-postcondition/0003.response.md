The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the `expressions` list, which contains tuples of values related to `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with their corresponding string representations. The maximum value and its associated expression are stored in `max_value` and `max_expr`, respectively.

Since `expressions` is a list of tuples where the first element is a numerical value (the output of some calculations involving `x`, `y`, and `z`), the code will determine the maximum of these values. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change, but `max_value` and `max_expr` will be assigned the maximum value and related expression from the list.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are three positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0]; `max_value` is the maximum value from the `expressions` list; `max_expr` is the corresponding expression for `max_value`.**
