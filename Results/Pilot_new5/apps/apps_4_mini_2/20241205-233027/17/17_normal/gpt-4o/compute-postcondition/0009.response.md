The function `func` accepts four parameters: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. Each parameter is a non-negative integer, where the constraints specify that 0 <= `cnt_i` <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}. Based on the output, the function's behavior is determined by conditions evaluated on these parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt.

Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, where each cnt_i is constrained to be between 0 and 10^9. The return value depends on the specific conditions evaluated within the function, which are not detailed in the provided information.**
