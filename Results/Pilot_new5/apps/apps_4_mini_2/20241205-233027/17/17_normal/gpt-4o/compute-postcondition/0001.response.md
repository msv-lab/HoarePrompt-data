`cnt2` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables (`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, as well as `cnt1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer.**
