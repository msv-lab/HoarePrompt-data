The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it utilizes four non-negative integer variables: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, where each of these counts can range from 0 to 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality without further details about what the function is supposed to return based on these counts.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but relies on four non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, which have constraints of being between 0 and 10^9. The return value is unspecified.**
