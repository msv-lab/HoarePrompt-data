The function accepts input values representing the number of days `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and for each day, the number of available products `k` and the number of clients `l`. It calculates the total products sold over the `n` days, allowing double sales for the first `f` days and normal sales for the remaining days, then prints the total sold. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input values (like negative `n` or `f` values) since it assumes valid inputs are provided.
