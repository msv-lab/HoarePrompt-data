The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `k` and `l`, using `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input strings into integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n`, and `_` starts at 0 in the loop. The values of `k` and `l` are not defined before this code, and they will be assigned based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 0 at the start of the loop, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
