The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days` where each tuple contains two integers representing the number of products and clients for each day. It calculates `regular_sales` as the minimum of products and clients for each day and `potential_sales_increase` as the potential additional sales if the products could double. The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of all regular sales and the largest `f` potential sales increases.
