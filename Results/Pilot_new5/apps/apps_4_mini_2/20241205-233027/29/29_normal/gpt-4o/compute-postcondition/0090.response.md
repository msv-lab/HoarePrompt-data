According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop can continue as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 and is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, and must also be a string representation that exists in `files_set`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify that `temp_counter` remains valid in both conditions. Since `temp_counter` is currently incremented by 1, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must still exist in `files_set`. 

As `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure:
1. The current value of `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n` which means `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of the current value of `temp_counter` must exist in `files_set`.

Given that the conditions are already satisfied at the end of the last iteration, we do not need to adjust anything.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * `n`, and `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` as a string representation.**
