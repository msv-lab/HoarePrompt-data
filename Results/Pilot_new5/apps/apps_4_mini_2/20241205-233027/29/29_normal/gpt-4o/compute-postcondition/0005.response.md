The code `examples.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the `examples` list. The initial state indicates that `name` is derived from the first tuple in the `files` list, which means it holds a specific value based on that tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect the addition of `name` to the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples that must contain at least 1 tuple, `file` is the first tuple in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`, the current value of `type_` is '1', and `examples` now contains `name`.**
