In the provided code snippet, `regulars.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. The initial state specifies that `name` is derived from the second tuple in `files`, which consists of at least two elements. The other variables, including `n` and `files`, remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`, `regulars` now includes `name`**.
