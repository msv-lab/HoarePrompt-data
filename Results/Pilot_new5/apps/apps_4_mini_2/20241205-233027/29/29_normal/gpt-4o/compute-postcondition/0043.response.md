According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and the condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be satisfied: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1. This means that its current value is now `temp_counter + 1`. Given that `temp_counter` was adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` before the increment, we need to ensure:

1. The incremented value (`temp_counter + 1`) must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, meaning `temp_counter` must have been at most `2 * n - 1` before the increment.
2. Additionally, the string representation of the incremented value, `str(temp_counter + 1)`, must also be in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we can conclude that:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to ensure it is at most `2 * n - 1`, so its value must be `2 * n - 1`.
- We also need to ensure `str(temp_counter + 1)` (which is `str(2 * n)`) is in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be 2 * n - 1, and str(temp_counter + 1) must be in files_set**
