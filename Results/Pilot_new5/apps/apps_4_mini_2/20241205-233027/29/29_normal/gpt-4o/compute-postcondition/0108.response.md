According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and the condition involving `files_set`. The loop can execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, it is possible that `temp_counter` could be equal to `2 * n` and in that case, the loop would not execute again unless `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be strictly less than `2 * n`. Thus, we can state that `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be less than `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`**.
