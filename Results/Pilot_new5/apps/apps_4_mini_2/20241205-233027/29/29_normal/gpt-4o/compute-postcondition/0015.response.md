The code snippet `name, type_ = file.split()` splits the string in `file` into two parts based on whitespace. Here, `name` is assigned the first part of the string and `type_` is assigned the second part. The initial state indicates that `file` is the third tuple in `files`, and thus it contains at least two parts when split. 

Since `file` is a string representation of a tuple containing at least two elements, the result of the split will provide specific values for `name` and `type_`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file` after the split.**
