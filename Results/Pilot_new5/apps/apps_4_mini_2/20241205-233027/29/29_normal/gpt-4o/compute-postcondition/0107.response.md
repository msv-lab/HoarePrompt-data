The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. It must have been less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` before the increment, so after the increment, it will be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The state of `n` and the condition on `temp_counter` remain valid. The value of `temp_counter` will now be one greater than its previous value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
