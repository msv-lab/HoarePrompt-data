`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` was initially greater than `2 * n`, after the increment, it will still be greater than `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` now includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`; `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` now includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.**
