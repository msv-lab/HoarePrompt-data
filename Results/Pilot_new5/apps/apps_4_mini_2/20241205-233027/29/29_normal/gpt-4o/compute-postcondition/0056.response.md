According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and the condition that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to its previous value and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. This means that for the loop to potentially execute one more time, `temp_counter` must currently be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

Since `temp_counter` is stated to be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, we can conclude that it needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be ensured to still be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`**
