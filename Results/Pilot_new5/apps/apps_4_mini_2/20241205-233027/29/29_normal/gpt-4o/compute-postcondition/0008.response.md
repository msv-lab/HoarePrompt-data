Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least one tuple, `file` is the first tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, and `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` now contains `name`. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `regulars` now includes `name`.***
