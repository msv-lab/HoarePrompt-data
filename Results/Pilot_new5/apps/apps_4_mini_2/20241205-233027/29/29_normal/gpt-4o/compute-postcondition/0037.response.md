Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is a list containing the string `move {examples[0]} {1}`, `i` is still 0, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` plus 1 if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.***
