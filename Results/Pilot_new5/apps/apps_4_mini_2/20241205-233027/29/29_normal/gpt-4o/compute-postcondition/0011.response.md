`examples` is updated to include the value of `name`, which is the first part of the string in the tuple `file`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`, and `examples` now includes `name`.
