The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. 

- `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples. Each tuple contains a string (filename) and an integer (type), where the integer can either be 0 (indicating a regular test) or 1 (indicating an example test). The filenames are distinct and consist of digits and small English letters, with lengths ranging from 1 to 6 characters.

The function returns a list of all move instructions made, reflecting the updates based on the evaluations of the filenames classified as 'regulars'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples files, where each tuple contains a string and an integer. It returns a list of move instructions based on the evaluations of the filenames in 'regulars'.**
