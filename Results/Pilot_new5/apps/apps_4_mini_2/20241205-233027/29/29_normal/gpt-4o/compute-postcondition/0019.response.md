Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0'. If `n` is 0, then `files` is an empty list, and both `examples` and `regulars` remain empty lists.**
