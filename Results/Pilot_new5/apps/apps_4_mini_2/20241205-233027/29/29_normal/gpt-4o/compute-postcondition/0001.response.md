The code initializes an empty list called `regulars`. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer and `files` is a list of tuples with each tuple containing a filename and an integer type (0 or 1), while `examples` is an empty list. The state of `n`, `files`, and `examples` remains unchanged, and the new list `regulars` is created without affecting these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains a string (filename) and an integer (type) which is either 0 (regular test) or 1 (example test), `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list.**
