The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` before the operation, it remains less than `2 * n` after the increment. The state of the other variables, `n` and `str(temp_counter)`, remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.**
