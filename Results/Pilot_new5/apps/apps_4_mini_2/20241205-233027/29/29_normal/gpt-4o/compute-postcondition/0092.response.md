According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will continue executing as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, two conditions must be satisfied:
1. `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of the new `temp_counter` must exist in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` has already been incremented by 1, it must currently be less than or equal to `2 * n` to allow for one more execution. Therefore, we can state that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` at the end of the last iteration.

If `temp_counter` was equal to `2 * n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute any further, so `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than `2 * n`. Additionally, we must ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
