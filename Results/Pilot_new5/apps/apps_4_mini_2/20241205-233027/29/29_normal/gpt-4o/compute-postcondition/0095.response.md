The code appends a string to the list `moves`, formatted to include the values of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is confirmed to be greater than `2 * n`, and since `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, it implies `temp_counter` has not been previously recorded. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, and `moves` now includes the string `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'**.
