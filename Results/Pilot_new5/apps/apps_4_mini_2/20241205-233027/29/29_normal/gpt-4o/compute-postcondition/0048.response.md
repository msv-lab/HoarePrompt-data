`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n + k`. After the increment, `temp_counter` will now be between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + k + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is str(temp_counter)**
