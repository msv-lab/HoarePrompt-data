#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and files is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains a string (filename) and an integer (type) which is either 0 (regular test) or 1 (example test). The filenames are distinct and consist of digits and small English letters with lengths ranging from 1 to 6 characters.

If `n` is 0, then `files` is an empty list, and both `examples` and `regulars` remain empty lists.

If `regulars[i]` was not equal to the expected target, the final state also includes the appropriate entries in `moves` reflecting any changes made during the iterations.
    return moves
    #The program returns the list of all move instructions made, reflecting the updates based on the evaluations of the filenames in 'regulars'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, categorizes the filenames into examples and regular tests, and generates move instructions to ensure the filenames follow a sequential order from `1` to `n`, returning a list of these instructions. If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.
