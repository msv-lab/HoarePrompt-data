To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop.

The loop will continue executing while both conditions are satisfied:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, which means it is currently `temp_counter + 1`, and we have the condition that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp_counter + 1` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Thus, `temp_counter` must be at most `2 * n - 1`.
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, we must ensure:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`.
2. `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently `temp_counter + 1`, we need to adjust it back down to `temp_counter`, and ensure that it satisfies the conditions.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1, and str(temp_counter + 1) must be in files_set`**
