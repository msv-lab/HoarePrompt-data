Let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code provided.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n - 1`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Now, let's examine the code:
```
temp_counter += 1
```
This line increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. Since `temp_counter` is currently `2 * n - 1`, after executing the code, the new value of `temp_counter` will be:

`temp_counter = (2 * n - 1) + 1 = 2 * n`.

All other variables' states remain unchanged. The conditions involving `n` and `files_set` still hold true after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, and str(temp_counter + 1) must be in files_set.**
