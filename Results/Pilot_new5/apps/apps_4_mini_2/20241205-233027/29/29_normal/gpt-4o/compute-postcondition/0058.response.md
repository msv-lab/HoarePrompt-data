According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as both conditions `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `i` is updated to `i + 1`, which does not affect the loop conditions.
3. `temp_counter` is increased by 1, so its current value is one greater than it was at the end of the last iteration.
4. `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and for the loop to run again, it must also be that `temp_counter` continues to satisfy this condition.
5. `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` was increased by 1, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `temp_counter` must currently be less than `2 * n`, which means it can be at most `2 * n - 1`. 

We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`, meaning it must be in the set for the current value of `temp_counter`.

Thus, we need to state that `temp_counter` must continue to be less than or equal to `2 * n` and that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`**
