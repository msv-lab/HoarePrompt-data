The code assigns an empty list to the variable `moves`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list.**
