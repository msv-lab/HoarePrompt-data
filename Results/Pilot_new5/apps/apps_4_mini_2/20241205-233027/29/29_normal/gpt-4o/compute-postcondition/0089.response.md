The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and must be in the `files_set` as a string representation, the update to `temp_counter` maintains these conditions as long as the initial value of `temp_counter` was within the defined limits. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * `n`, and `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` as a string representation.**
