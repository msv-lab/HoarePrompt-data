To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

1. The loop will execute if both conditions are satisfied: 
   - `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
   - `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

2. We know from the provided state:
   - `n` is a positive integer, which means `2 * n` is also guaranteed to be positive.
   - `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` plus 1 if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, this implies that `examples[1]` is not equal to `2`.

3. Therefore, `temp_counter` is definitely greater than `2 * n`, which means the first part of the `while` condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) is not satisfied.

4. To ensure the loop can execute, we must adjust `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, we also need to consider the second condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`). Since we don't know the contents of `files_set`, we cannot make any assumptions regarding that.

5. Thus, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be set to a valid value that satisfies both conditions. We can set `temp_counter` to be `2 * n` or less. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`**.
