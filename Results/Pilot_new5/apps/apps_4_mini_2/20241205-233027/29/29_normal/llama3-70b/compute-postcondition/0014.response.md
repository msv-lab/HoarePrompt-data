The variable `regular` is assigned a list comprehension that filters the tuples in `files` based on the second element being equal to 0. The first elements of those tuples (if the second element is 0) are collected into the list `regular`. The initial state indicates that `files` contains `n` tuples sorted in descending order and that `examples` is a list containing the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1. The states of the variables `n`, `files`, and `examples` are not affected, but `regular` is updated based on the filtering condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list containing the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.**
