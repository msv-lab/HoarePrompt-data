The `script` list is being appended with a formatted string that includes the value of `file` and `i`. The value of `file` is the second element in the list `examples`, and `i` is currently 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple, `examples` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `file` is the second element in `examples`, `i` is 2, and `script` has been updated to include the string `move {file} 2`.**
