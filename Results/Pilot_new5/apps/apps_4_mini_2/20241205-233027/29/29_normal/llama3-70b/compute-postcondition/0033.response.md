According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `script` variable, which must contain at least one more string for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is the first string in `script`, and for the loop to execute one more time, the `script` must have at least 2 strings, and `line` must be updated to the next string in the `script`. 

If `line` has been printed and assuming `script` has more than one string, `i` remains unchanged as it is dependent on `examples` and `n`. After printing the current `line`, it will move to the next iteration of the loop, so we need to adjust `line` to be the next string in `script`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, `script` has at least 2 strings, `line` is the second string in `script`**
