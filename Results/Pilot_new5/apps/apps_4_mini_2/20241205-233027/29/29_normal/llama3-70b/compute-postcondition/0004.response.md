`files` is updated to include a tuple containing `name` and the integer value of `type_`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `files` and the unchanged state of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string.**
