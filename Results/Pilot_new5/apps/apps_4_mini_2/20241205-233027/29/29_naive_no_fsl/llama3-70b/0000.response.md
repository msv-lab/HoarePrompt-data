Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the new filenames conflict with existing filenames. According to the problem description, if a filename `file_2` already exists when executing the "move" command, it should be overwritten. However, the program does not check if the new filenames (`i` and `len(examples) + 1`, etc.) are already occupied by other files before issuing the move commands. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
1 0
2 1
3 0
```

In this case, the expected output should be:

```
3
move 2 1
move 3 2
```

However, the program will attempt to move `2` to `1` and then `3` to `2`, resulting in an incorrect sequence of operations where the content of `1` would be lost after the first move, causing the program to fail to produce the intended distinct integer filenames starting from `1` without any gaps. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem in all cases.
