The statement `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i` updates the `position_map` with the entry of the coordinates `(current_x, current_y)` mapped to the current value of `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, but with the additional entry in `position_map`.

Output State: **`final_x` is the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of `dx` or `dy` is non-zero; if `target_pos` is found in `position_map`, then `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` is updated with the entry `(current_x, current_y): i`; `n` is greater than 1; and `i` is now incremented by 1.**
