The variable `current_y` is assigned the value 0. The initial state does not change any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity; `current_x` is 0; `current_y` is 0.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity; `current_x` is 0; `current_y` is 0.**
