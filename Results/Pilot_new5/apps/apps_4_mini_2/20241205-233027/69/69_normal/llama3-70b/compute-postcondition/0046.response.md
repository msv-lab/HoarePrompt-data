The value of `dy` is decremented by 1. Since `dy` is greater than 0, its new value will be `dy - 1`, which remains a positive value. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` that is greater than 0, `op` is equal to 'U', and `dy` is now `dy - 1` (a positive value).

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` that is greater than 0, `op` is equal to 'U', `dy` is a positive value equal to `dy - 1`.**
