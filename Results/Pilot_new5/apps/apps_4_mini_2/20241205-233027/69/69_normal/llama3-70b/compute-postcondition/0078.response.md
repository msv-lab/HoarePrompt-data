Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1 and `res` may remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the operation. Otherwise, `dx` remains unchanged and `res` is incremented by 1.***
