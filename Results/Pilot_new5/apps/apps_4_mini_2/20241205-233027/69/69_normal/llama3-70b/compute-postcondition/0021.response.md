`uy` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `uy` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string, `uy` is increased by 1, and `ux` is unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string, `uy` is increased by 1, and `ux` is unchanged.**
