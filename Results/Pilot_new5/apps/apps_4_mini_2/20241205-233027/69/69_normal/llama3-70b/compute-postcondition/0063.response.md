`dy` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`operations`, `op`, `dx`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dx` is the current value, `dy` is decreased by 1, and `res` is the current value.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dx` is the current value, `dy` is decreased by 1, `res` is the current value**.
