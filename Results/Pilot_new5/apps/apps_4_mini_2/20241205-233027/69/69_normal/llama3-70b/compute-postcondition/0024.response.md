The variable `ux` is decremented by 1. The values of `uy`, `op`, `operations`, and the original value of `ux` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the change in `ux`.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string, `uy` is unchanged, `ux` is decreased by 1.**
