`uy` is decremented by 1, while `ux` and `uy` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string; `uy` is decreased by 1; `ux` is unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string; `uy` is decreased by 1; `ux` is unchanged.**
