Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 while `dy` and `res` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is increased by 1, with `dy` and `res` remaining unchanged. In all other cases, `dy` and `dx` remain unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
