The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `(x, y)` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. 

Based on the output description, the function processes the string of operations to compute a new position starting from the coordinates (x, y). The function returns the final coordinates after applying all operations in the string. 

Functionality: **The function computes a new position based on a series of movement operations represented by the string and returns the final coordinates as integers.**
