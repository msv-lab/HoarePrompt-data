According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more operations in `ops`. At the end of the last iteration, `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1. Since the loop variable `op` is iterating over `ops`, for it to execute one more time, the length of `operations` must be at least 2. 

If we denote `ops` as the remaining operations in `operations`, after the last iteration, `op` would point to the next operation in the string, which implies `op` will be the next character in `operations`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must have at least 2 characters remaining (one for the current iteration and one for the next).

As the loop will pick the next operation from `ops` on the next iteration, the value of `op` will be the next character in the string and the loop variable will already be incremented to point to the next operation.

State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` and `dx` remain unchanged, `res` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on the operation.**
