Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 0. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is positive, then `dy` is decremented by 1. If `op` is not 'U', and if `op` is 'D' with `dy` being less than 0, then `dy` is set to 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is reduced by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is adjusted to be at least 0. In all other cases, `res` is increased by 1.***
