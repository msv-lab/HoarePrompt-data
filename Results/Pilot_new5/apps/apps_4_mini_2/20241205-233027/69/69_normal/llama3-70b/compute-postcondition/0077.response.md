`res` is incremented by 1. The values of `operations`, `op`, `dy`, and `dx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, `dx` remains unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, `dx` remains unchanged, `res` is incremented by 1.**
