Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string; if `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1 while the values of `x`, `y`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decremented by 1, and the values of `x`, `y`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged.***
