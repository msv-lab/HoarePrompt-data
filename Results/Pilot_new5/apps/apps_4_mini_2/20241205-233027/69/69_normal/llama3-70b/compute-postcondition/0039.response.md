The values of `dx` and `dy` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `ux`, `y`, and `uy`. Specifically, `dx` is calculated as `x - ux` and `dy` is calculated as `y - uy`. The previous values of `ux` and `uy` are derived from the counts of 'R', 'L', 'U', and 'D' in the string `operations`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, we will represent `dx` and `dy` in terms of the existing variables.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ux` is the net horizontal movement based on the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is the net vertical movement based on the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; `x` and `y` remain unchanged; `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged.**
