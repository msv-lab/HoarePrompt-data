The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'A', `count[nc]` is now one less than its previous value and still greater than or equal to 0, `res` now includes 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
