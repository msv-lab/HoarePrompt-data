The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string, which must have a length equal to `n` and can consist of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but `s` now holds the user-provided string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is the input string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is the input string of length `n`.**
