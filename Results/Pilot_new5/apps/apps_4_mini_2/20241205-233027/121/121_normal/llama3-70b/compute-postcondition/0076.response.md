The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers, and `count[nc]` has not been changed but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
