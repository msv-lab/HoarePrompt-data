The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `n // 4`, which is the integer division of `n` by 4. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\), the value of `avg` will range from 1 to 63 depending on the exact value of `n`. The counts in `count` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will include the updated value of `avg` but retain the original information about `n` and `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `count` is {'A': x, 'C': y, 'G': z, 'T': w}; `avg` is `n // 4`.**
