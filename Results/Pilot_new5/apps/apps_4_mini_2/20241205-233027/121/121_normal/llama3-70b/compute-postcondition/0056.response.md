Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` has been updated with `count[nc]` decreased by 1; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `c` is the next character in `s`; `res` is increased by `nc`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count[nc]` was greater than 0.***
