The `print('===')` statement outputs the string '===', but it does not change any variables or their values. The states of `n`, `s`, and `counts` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a dictionary containing counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The current value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`.**
