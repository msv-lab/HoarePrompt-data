The line `counts[char] += 1` increments the count of `char` in the `counts` dictionary (or similar structure) by 1. Since `counts[char]` is already prepared to be checked against `target_count`, we assume it had some initial value, which is now increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is updated at index `i` with `char`, `counts[char]` is increased by 1 and should be checked against `target_count` for the next iteration.**
