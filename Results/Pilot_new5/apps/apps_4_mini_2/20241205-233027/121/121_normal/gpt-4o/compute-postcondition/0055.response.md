Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `result` is a list of length `n` containing characters from `s`. If `result[i]` is equal to '?', then `i` is equal to the number of unique characters added to `result`, and `result` contains the characters from `counts` that were less than `target_count` at the beginning of the loop. Additionally, `counts` reflects the final state where the count of each character in `counts` has been incremented according to how many times they were added to `result` and remains less than `target_count` for the characters that were not added.***
