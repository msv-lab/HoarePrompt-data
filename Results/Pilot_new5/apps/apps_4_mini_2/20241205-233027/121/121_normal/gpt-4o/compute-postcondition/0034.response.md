Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a dictionary containing counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. After the loop executes, if no counts exceeded `target_count`, the output will be that `counts['A']`, `counts['C']`, `counts['G']`, and `counts['T']` are all less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts` contains only zeros, it remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
