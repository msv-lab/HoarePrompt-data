Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is a list of length `n` containing characters from `s`, `i` is 1, `result[0]` is `char`, `counts` has at least 2 elements, and `char` is the second character in `counts`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, `result[1]` is set to `char`, `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
