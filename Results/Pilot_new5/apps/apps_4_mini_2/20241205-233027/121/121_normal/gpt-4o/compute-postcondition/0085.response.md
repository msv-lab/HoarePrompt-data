The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `result` has been updated at index `n` with `char`; `i` is equal to `n`; `counts` is a non-empty string or collection, and `counts[char]` has been incremented by 1.
