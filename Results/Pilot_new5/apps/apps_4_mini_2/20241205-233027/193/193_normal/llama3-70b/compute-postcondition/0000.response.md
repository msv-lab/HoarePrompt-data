The values of `x` and `y` are reassigned by taking input from the user and converting them into integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function. The conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means that after this reassignment, `x` and `y` will still satisfy these conditions, but their specific values will now depend on the user input. Therefore, the previous constraints on `x` and `y` remain valid, but their values have changed.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
