The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is determined by these constraints. Since there is no specific output behavior provided in the prompt, we cannot delineate specific return cases. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate with the integers `x` and `y` that comply with the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates with integers x and y where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
