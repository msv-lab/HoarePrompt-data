To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and see if it adheres to the problem description.

The program is supposed to transform matrix \( B \) (initially all zeroes) into matrix \( A \) (which contains \( 0s \) and \( 1s \)) by performing \( 2 \times 2 \) operations that set certain elements in \( B \) to \( 1 \). The objective is to check whether it can achieve this transformation and output the required operations.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) and then reads matrix \( A \).

2. **Finding Operations:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - It iterates through each cell in \( A \) (considering only cells that can be the top-left corner of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix).
   - For each cell, it checks if all four corners of the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are \( 1 \). If they are, it continues to the next cell.
   - If at least one of the four corners is \( 1 \), it appends the position of the top-left corner of the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to `ops`.

3. **Handling Output:**
   - After collecting the operations, it checks if the number of operations exceeds \( 2500 \). If it does, it returns \(-1\).
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

### Problem with the Logic:
The code does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). It simply checks for the presence of \( 1s \) in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices but does not ensure that after performing those operations, \( B \) will actually match \( A \).

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:

Input:
```
2 2
1 0
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```
Explanation: It is impossible to create the desired matrix \( A \) from \( B \) using \( 2 \times 2 \) operations, as the only operation we can perform would affect all four cells of a \( 2 \times 2 \) area. 

However, the provided program would identify that at least one \( 1 \) exists in the \( 2 \times 2 \) area and would incorrectly generate operations, not accounting for the fact that it cannot leave a \( 0 \) intact in a \( 2 \times 2 \) operation.

### Conclusion:
Due to this flaw, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly in terms of determining if it is possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \).

Correctness: **False**.
