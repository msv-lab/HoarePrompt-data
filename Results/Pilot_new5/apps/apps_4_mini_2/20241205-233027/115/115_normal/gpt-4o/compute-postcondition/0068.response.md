According to the code, the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, while `m` is greater than 0. Since there is no change to `i` in the loop and `j` is the variable that will change, we need to consider the value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the current value of `j` is such that it is less than `m - 1`, it will allow for another iteration. Thus, if `j` is currently at `m - 1`, the loop will not execute again.

To summarize:
- After the last iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1 to allow for the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

So if `j` is currently `k` (where `k < m - 1`), then on the next iteration `j` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the current value of `j` and `k` is less than `m`**.
