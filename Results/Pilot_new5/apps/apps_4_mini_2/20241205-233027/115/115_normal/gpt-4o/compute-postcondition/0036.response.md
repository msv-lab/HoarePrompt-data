The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The values used for the tuple are derived from the current values of `i` and `j`. 

- The value of `i` is 2, thus `i + 1` equals 3.
- The value of `j` is 0, therefore `j + 1` equals 1.

The tuple `(3, 1)` is appended to the `operations` list.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is updated with `B[2][0] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[3][0] = 1`, `B[3][1] = 1`, `operations` contains tuples including (2, 1) and (3, 1), `j` is 0, and the values of `A` at positions `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are all equal to 1.**
