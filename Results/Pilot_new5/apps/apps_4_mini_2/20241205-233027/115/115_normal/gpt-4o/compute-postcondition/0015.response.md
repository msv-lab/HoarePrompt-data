Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m - 1`, and if `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then operations include `(1, j + 1)` where `j + 1` is in the range from 1 to `m - 1`. If the condition is not met, no operations are specified.***
