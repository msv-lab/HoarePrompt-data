Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B` is updated with `B[2][0] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[3][0] = 1`, `B[3][1] = 1`, and `operations` contains tuples including (2, 1) and (3, 1).***
