Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1, and `operations` includes the tuple `(1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.***
