Output State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all j in range(m). If for any j, `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function would have returned -1 earlier; otherwise, nothing is returned.**
