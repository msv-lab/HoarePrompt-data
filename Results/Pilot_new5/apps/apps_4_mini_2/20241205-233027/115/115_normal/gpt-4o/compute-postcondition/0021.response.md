The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given that `i` is 1, the new values for the tuple will become `(2, j + 1)`. The variable `j` remains unchanged. The dimensions of `B` and its values are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, and `operations` now contains the tuple `(2, j + 1)`.**
