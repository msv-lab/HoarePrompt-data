Let's analyze the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. You are given two matrices, \(A\) and \(B\).
2. Matrix \(A\) contains binary values (0s and 1s), while \(B\) starts as a zero matrix.
3. You can set any \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \(B\) to 1.
4. The goal is to determine if you can make \(B\) equal to \(A\) and print the operations to do so.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function reads the dimensions of the matrices and constructs \(A\).
2. It initializes \(B\) as a zero matrix.
3. The code iterates through all possible positions for the top-left corner of \(2 \times 2\) submatrices within \(A\).
4. If it finds a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix of 1s in \(A\), it marks the corresponding submatrix in \(B\) as 1 and records the operation.
5. Finally, it checks if \(A\) is equal to \(B\) and returns \(-1\) if they are not equal, or prints the operations if they are.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. If \(A\) has isolated `1`s (not part of any \(2 \times 2\) submatrix), such as:
   ```
   1 0
   0 0
   ```
   In this case, the function would not be able to turn \(B\) into \(A\) because it cannot operate on isolated `1`s.
   
2. The function runs a full check of \(A\) against \(B\) after attempting to set \(B\) based on \(A\), which is correct.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function checks for \(2 \times 2\) submatrices of `1`s in \(A` and sets the corresponding parts of \(B\). They also mention a return of \(-1\) when \(A\) and \(B\) do not match. This matches the logic in the code.

### Conclusion:
Given the edge case of isolated `1`s, we can conclude that the code does not handle cases where `1`s are not part of a complete \(2 \times 2\) submatrix. Thus, there are valid configurations of \(A\) where the program will return \(-1\) incorrectly when it is indeed impossible to create \(B\) to equal \(A\).

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to account for configurations where `1`s are isolated and cannot be formed into complete \(2 \times 2\) submatrices, leading to an incorrect decision of impossibility when it is indeed not achievable.
