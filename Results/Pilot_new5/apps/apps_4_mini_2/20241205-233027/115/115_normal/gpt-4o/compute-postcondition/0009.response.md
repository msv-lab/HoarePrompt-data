The code assigns the value `1` to four locations in the array `B`: `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `0` and `j` is `j + 1`, meaning we are incrementing `j` with the value already present. However, since the specific value of `j` isn't provided, we consider it as a general variable that will be updated accordingly.

After executing the code, we can conclude:
- `B[i][j]` becomes `1`
- `B[i][j + 1]` becomes `1`
- `B[i + 1][j]` becomes `1`
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]` becomes `1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged; however, `j` is effectively incremented due to `j` being defined as `j + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `operations` are unchanged**.
