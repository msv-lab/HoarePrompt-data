According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which means that the loop will execute `n` times. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 (as per the problem constraints), this means that the loop can execute successfully as long as `i` is defined within the loop.

Before the loop starts, `B` is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions `n x m`, which ensures `B` can accommodate the loop's index `i`. The state of the variable `i` must start at 0, which is the initial value in the range of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute properly are that `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
