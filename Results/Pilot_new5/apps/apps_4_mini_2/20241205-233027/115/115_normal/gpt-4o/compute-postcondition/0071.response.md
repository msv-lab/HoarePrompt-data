Output State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and for all j in range(m), `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function would return -1; otherwise, there are no changes or returns from the function.**
