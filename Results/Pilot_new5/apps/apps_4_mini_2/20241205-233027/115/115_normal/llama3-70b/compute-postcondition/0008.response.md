Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` is an empty list, and `j` is 0. The elements at positions `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, and `A[1][1]` are all equal to 1, and at least one of the following is true: `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1.***
