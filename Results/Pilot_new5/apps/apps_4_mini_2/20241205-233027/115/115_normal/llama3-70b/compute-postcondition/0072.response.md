Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `ops` contains tuples indicating unique positions in `A` where at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `ops` must contain tuples indicating positions in `A`, the last tuple in `ops` is stored in `op`, and the output consists of the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`, with the final output being the integer value `len(ops)` representing the total number of tuples in `ops.`***
