The `continue` statement does not modify any variables or the state of the program. It simply causes the current iteration of the loop to stop, and the next iteration begins immediately. Since there are no variables being changed or affected by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` is an empty list, `j` is 0. The element at position `A[0][0]` is 1, the element at position `A[1][0]` is 1, the element at position `A[0][1]` is 1, and the element at position `A[1][1]` is 1.**
