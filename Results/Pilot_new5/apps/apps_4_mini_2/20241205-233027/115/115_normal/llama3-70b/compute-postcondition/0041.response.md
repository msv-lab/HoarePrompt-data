According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i` which is currently 1 and the condition for the loop is based on `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, which implies that `n - 1` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. For the loop to be executed again (the next iteration), `n` must be greater than 2 (because `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2).

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is now `m - 1`**
