The operation `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are used to calculate the values being appended, but we don't have their specific values provided in the initial state. Since the initial state mentions that we are dealing with a 2D list `A`, we can only conclude that if the conditions for continuing the iteration of the loop are met, this operation executes.

Therefore, the output state reflects the conditionally modified state of the variables without knowing the exact values of `i` and `j`, but it notes that `ops` has been modified:

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s; `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.
