The code prints the first element of the first tuple in `ops` and the second element of the same tuple. The values of `op` are derived from the first tuple in `ops`. Therefore, the output will specifically reflect the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least 1 tuple, `op` is the first tuple in `ops`, and the output is the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
