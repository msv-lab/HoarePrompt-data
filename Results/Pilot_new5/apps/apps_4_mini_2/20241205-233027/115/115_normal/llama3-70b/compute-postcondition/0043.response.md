Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is now `m - 1`, and the values of `A` at positions (2, j), (3, j), (2, j + 1), and (3, j + 1) are all equal to 1.***
