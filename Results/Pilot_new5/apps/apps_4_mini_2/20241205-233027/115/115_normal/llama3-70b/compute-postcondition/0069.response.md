According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ops` list. If `ops` has at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute for a third time. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `ops` must have at least 2 tuples, and `op` is equal to the second tuple in `ops`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must have at least 3 tuples, `op` will then be the third tuple in `ops`, and we must adjust the output to reflect the values of this new `op[0]` and `op[1]`.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least 3 tuples, `op` is equal to the third tuple in `ops`, and the output is the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
