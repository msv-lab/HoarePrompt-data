The code `continue` is a control flow statement used within loops. It does not change the values of any variables directly, but it will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the initial state shows that `i` is 1, and considering that `continue` would normally be used in a loop to signal moving to the next iteration, it implies we are in some loop where `i` may be incremented or some other actions may have been intended for that loop.

However, as the code does not modify any variables and merely continues to the next iteration, the output state remains unchanged for all variables.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
