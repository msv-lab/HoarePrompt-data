The value of `i` is 2, and `j` is 3. Therefore, `i + 1` is equal to 3, and `j + 1` is equal to 4. The tuple `(3, 4)` is appended to the `ops` list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `ops` contains the additional tuple (3, 4), `j` is 3.**
