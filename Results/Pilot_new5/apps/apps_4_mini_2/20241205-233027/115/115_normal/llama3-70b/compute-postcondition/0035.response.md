According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the specific value of `j`, but we know that `j` must be such that the loop can potentially execute again. 

Since the loop iterates with `j` starting from 0 and goes up to `m - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`. To keep the loop condition valid for one more iteration, `j + 1` must be less than `m - 1` which means `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `j` must be less than `m - 2`**
