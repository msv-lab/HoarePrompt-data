According to the code, the loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` can be incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must become 1. Hence, the state at the beginning of the next iteration will update `i` to 1. 

Since there are no changes specified for the other variables, they remain the same. Thus, the updated state is:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating the positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is `m - 1`**
