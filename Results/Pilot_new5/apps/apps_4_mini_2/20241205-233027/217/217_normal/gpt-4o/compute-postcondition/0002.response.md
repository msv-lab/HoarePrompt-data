The variable `B` is assigned the sum of all positive integers from the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` contains `n` integers each satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, `B` will be the sum of those integers in `a` that are greater than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.**
