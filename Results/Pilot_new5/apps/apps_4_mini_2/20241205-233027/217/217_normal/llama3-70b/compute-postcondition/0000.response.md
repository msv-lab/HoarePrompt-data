The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer that must satisfy `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The value of `a` remains unchanged since the code only modifies `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `n` is now an input integer**.
