According to the code, the loop is set to iterate from `0` to `n-1`. In the previous state, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop has completed its iterations, and `i` is now outside the valid range for accessing the list `a`, which has indices `0` to `n-1`. 

If the loop were to execute one more time, `i` would be incremented beyond `n`, which would lead to an `IndexError` as it would try to access `a[n]`, which is out of bounds. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we must consider that `i` would be equal to `n + 1`, and since `n` is between `1` and `100`, for the loop to execute again, we would need to acknowledge that `i` is outside the valid range already.

Therefore, the relevant states need to be updated as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n + 1.**
