The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-' as per the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-' as per the user input.**
