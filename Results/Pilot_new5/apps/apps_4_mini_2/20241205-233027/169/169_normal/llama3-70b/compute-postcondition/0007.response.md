The code prints the result of `plus_count - minus_count`. Given that `plus_count` is greater than or equal to `minus_count`, this value will either be positive or zero. The initial state does not change except for the output from the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, `plus_count`, and the result of the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`, and the result of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed.**
