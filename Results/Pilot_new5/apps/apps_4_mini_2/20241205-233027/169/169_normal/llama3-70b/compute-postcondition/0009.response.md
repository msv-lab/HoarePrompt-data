The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and `s` is a string that consists of `n` characters, each being either `'+'` or `'-'`. 

Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate the string `s` of length `n`, which contains the characters `'+'` and `'-'`, and return a value based on the contents of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-'.**
