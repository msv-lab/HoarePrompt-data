The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string `s` remains unchanged since the provided snippet only modifies `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer, while `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'**.
