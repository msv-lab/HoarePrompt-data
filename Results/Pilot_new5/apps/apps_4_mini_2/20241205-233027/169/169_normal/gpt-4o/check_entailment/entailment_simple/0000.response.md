Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the number of stones to zero. This is valid because it simulates the scenario where Vasya starts with a minimum number of stones.

2. **Processing Operations**:
    - For each operation, if the operation is `'+'`, it increments the `stones` count, indicating that a stone has been added.
    - If the operation is `'-'`, it attempts to decrement the `stones` count. However, it ensures that the number of stones does not go below zero by using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This adheres to the constraint that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

3. **Final Count**: After processing all operations, it outputs the total number of stones left in the pile. This total is guaranteed to be the minimal possible number of stones after executing all operations, considering the constraints provided in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases:
    - If all operations are `'-'`, it does not allow the stone count to go negative.
    - If all operations are `'+'`, it correctly increases the count.
    - Mixed operations are also handled correctly, reflecting realistic scenarios of stone addition and removal.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem requirements for every possible input scenario, confirming its correctness.
