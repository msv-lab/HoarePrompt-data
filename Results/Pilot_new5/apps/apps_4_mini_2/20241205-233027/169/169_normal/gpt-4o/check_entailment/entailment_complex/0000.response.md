Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of operations, `n`, and the operations string `s` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Operation Logic**: The program uses a loop to process each operation in the string `s`:
   - If the operation is `'+'`, it correctly increases the `stones` variable by 1.
   - If the operation is `'-'`, it decreases `stones` by 1, but ensures that `stones` does not go below 0 by using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This is crucial because the problem states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking a stone. By ensuring the count of stones does not drop below zero, it honors the condition that there were sufficient stones to perform the operations.

3. **Final Output**: After processing all operations, the program prints the final count of `stones`. The output represents the minimal possible number of stones remaining after the operations, as required in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases effectively:
   - When all operations are `'-'`, it correctly reduces `stones` to `0` instead of allowing it to go negative.
   - When all operations are `'+'`, it accumulates stones as expected.

5. **Valid States**: The state of `stones` is initialized to `0`, which aligns with the fact that if no stones are added initially, the number of stones can only be zero or more, depending on the operations performed.

The annotations in the code highlight that the `stones` variable accurately represents the net result of the operations and that no invalid states are possible due to the checks implemented.

Given all of these considerations, the program accurately reflects the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, it is deemed correct.
