Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the scenario where the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations. Specifically, it does not take into consideration that Vasya cannot take stones from the pile if there are not enough stones available initially. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `s = "--"`. According to the problem description, if Vasya initially had 0 stones, he cannot perform the first "-" operation because the pile is empty. The program will incorrectly output `0`, while the correct answer should state that he cannot take any stones from an empty pile. Thus, the program does not handle this edge case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases.
