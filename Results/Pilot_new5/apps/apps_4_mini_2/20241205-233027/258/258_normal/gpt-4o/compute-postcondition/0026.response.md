The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, constrained between 1 and 60 (1 <= N <= 60). 
- `K` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be ready, constrained between 1 and `N` (1 <= K <= N). 
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `(x_i, y_i, c_i)` representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. The constraints for these integers are -1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000, and 1 <= `c_i` <= 100.

After executing the function body, it determines and returns a specific outcome based on the input parameters. However, the exact nature of the output is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (number of pieces of meat), K (number of pieces to be ready), and meats (a list of tuples with coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat).**
