To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and its functionality in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net given by their coordinates (x_i, y_i) and hardness c_i. The time taken to grill i-th piece of meat is given by:
\[ \text{time}(i) = c_i \times \sqrt{(X - x_i)^2 + (Y - y_i)^2} \]
Takahashi needs to find the optimal position (X, Y) for the heat source such that at least K pieces of meat are ready within the minimum time possible.

### Program Overview:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads N, K, and the meat data (coordinates and hardness) correctly.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: `func_2` implements a binary search to minimize time T. It calls `func_1` to check if at least K pieces can be grilled within time T.
3. **Distance Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program checks pairs of meats and calculates the potential midpoint for optimal placement of the heat source. It uses the properties of distances and weights (hardness).
4. **Counting Ready Pieces**: It counts how many pieces of meat can be grilled within the threshold time T using the calculated midpoint coordinates.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints**: The program adheres to the input constraints:
   - 1 ≤ N ≤ 60
   - 1 ≤ K ≤ N
   - -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000
   - 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100
   - All coordinates are unique.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance calculation is based on the formula provided in the problem description, ensuring that it factors in both the coordinates and the hardness of the meat, thus aligning with how the grilling time is computed.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search iteratively narrows down the possible minimum time by repeatedly invoking `func_1`, which checks if at least K pieces of meat can be grilled within the current estimated time. This approach is efficient given the constraints.

4. **Final Output**: The output format is specified to be printed with a precision of 6 decimal places, which aligns with the problem requirements for accuracy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It accurately reads input, processes the data to determine the optimal grilling time using geometric principles, and prints the result in the specified format with the required precision.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
