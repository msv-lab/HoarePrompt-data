The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are previously defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Therefore, `d2` becomes `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` which simplifies to `( (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2 ) / 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `( (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2 ) / 4`.**
