The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. To analyze this, we first look at the values involved:

- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`.
- `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`.

The expression for `my` involves calculating `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, where both `d2` and `d` are already defined in the initial state.

Since we are assigning a value to `my`, this means `my` now holds a specific value derived from the previously defined variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to (c1 - c2) * T, `d2` is equal to (x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `mx` is equal to cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `my` is equal to cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
