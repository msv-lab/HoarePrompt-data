The variable `d` is assigned the result of the expression `c1 * T - c2 * T`. This simplifies to `(c1 - c2) * T`. Therefore, the value of `d` depends on the difference between `c1` and `c2` multiplied by `T`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`.
