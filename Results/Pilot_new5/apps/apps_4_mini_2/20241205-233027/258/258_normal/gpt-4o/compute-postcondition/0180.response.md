Precondition: `d` and `d2` are real numbers.  
Program Fragment:
```
if d * d2 > d2:
```
If part: No variables are changed; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Else part: None  

Postcondition: ***`d` and `d2` are real numbers. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables.***
