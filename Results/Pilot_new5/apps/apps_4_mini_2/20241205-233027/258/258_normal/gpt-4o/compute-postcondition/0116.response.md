Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, and `count` is equal to the count of tuples in `meats` satisfying the condition. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
