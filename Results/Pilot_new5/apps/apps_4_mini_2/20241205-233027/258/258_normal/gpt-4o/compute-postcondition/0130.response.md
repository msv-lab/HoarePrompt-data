To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we first need to analyze the provided initial state and the operation performed.

**Initial State:**
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is greater than `i + 2`
- `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

Now, the code snippet being executed is:
```
d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
```

**Impact of the code on the program:**
- The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. This is a calculation based on the previously defined values of `dx` and `dy`.
- The values of `dx` and `dy` are derived from the equations given in the initial state, but they remain unchanged by this operation.

Now let's expand on `d2`:
- `d2` will therefore be calculated as:
  - `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
  - This simplifies to `d2 = ((x1 - x2)^2 / 4) + ((y1 - y2)^2 / 4)`

Since the values of `dx` and `dy` are expressions based on `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`, we will retain the information of `dx` and `dy` in the output state.

**Output State:**
The state of the variables that remain unchanged, along with the new variable `d2`, will be represented as follows:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)^2 / 4) + ((y1 - y2)^2 / 4)`**
