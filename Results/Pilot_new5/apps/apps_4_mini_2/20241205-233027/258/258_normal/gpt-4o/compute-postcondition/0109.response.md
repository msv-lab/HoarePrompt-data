The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are previously defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Thus, `d2` will be equal to the sum of the squares of these two expressions.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) ** 2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2) ** 2`.
