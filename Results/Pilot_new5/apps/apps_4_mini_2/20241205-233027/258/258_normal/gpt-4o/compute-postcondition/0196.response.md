`cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cy`, but it is expressed in terms of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables `d`, `d2`, `cx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is a real number, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
