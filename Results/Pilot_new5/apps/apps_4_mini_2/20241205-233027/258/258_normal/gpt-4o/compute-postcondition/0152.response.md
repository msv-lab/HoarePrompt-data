The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. Since the initial states of `y1` and `y2` are not provided, `cy` will be equal to the average of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
