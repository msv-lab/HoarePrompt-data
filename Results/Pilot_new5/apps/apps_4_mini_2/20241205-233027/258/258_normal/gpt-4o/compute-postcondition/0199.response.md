The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values for `dx` and `dy` are determined by their definitions: `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Therefore, `d2` is calculated as follows:

- `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `d2 = (x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is calculated as `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
