The tuples at `meats[i]` and `meats[j]` are swapped. The variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to take the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to take the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The conditions regarding the initial state remain unchanged except for the updated values involved in this swap operation.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is equal to the count of tuples in `meats` satisfying the condition, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1` is now equal to `x2`, `y1` is now equal to `y2`, `c1` is now equal to `c2`, `x2` is now equal to the previous value of `x1`, `y2` is now equal to the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` is now equal to the previous value of `c1`.**
