The variable `cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. The specific values of `x1` and `x2` are not given, so `cx` will be equal to the average of `x1` and `x2`. Therefore, the Output State will include `cx` as a combination of `x1` and `x2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`**.
