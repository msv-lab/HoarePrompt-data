Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True, indicating that the condition for the number of tuples is met. If `count` is less than `K`, there is no else part involved in the code.***
