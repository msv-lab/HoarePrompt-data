The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, and performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness value that allows Takahashi to eat exactly `K` pieces of meat from the given list. It returns the last computed value of `high` after the iterations, which represents this maximum hardness threshold. The function relies on an external function `func_1` to check the feasibility of eating `K` pieces at the current hardness level.
