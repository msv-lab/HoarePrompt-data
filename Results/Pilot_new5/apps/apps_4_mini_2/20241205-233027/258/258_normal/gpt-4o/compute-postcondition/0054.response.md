The `continue` statement does not change the value of any variables or perform any calculations. It simply causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that we are moving to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
