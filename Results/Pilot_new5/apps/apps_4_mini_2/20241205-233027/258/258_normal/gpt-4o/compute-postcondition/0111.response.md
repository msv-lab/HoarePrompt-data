Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
