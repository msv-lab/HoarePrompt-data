The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`, which means it calculates the average of `y1` and `y2`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**.
