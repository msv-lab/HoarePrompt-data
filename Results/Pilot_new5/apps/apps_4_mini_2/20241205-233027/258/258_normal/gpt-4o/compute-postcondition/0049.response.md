`x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list. Given that `meats` is a list of tuples, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will now hold the components of the tuple located at that index. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2; x1, y1, c1` are now equal to the components of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`.**
