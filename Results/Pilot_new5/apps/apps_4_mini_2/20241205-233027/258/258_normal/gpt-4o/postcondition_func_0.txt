The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, a positive integer `K`, and a non-negative real number `T`. It returns `True` if there are at least `K` pieces of meat within a certain distance defined by the computed conditions involving their coordinates and hardness; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks pairs of meats, performing calculations based on their distances and hardness to determine the count of meats that meet the distance condition. Importantly, if no pairs meet the criteria such that the count is at least `K`, the function will return `False`. Edge cases may include scenarios where `K` is greater than the length of `meats`, which would directly result in `False`.
