The code assigns the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. The initial values provided are `x` is -1000 and `y` is -998. The values of `K`, `ans`, and the result of `func_2` are currently unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Since the output of `func_2` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values that `times` will take. Therefore, the output state will include the updated variable `times` and the known values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`**
