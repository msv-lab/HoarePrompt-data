The variable `times` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` are -998 and -1000 respectively, so `times` will be a sorted version of the non-empty list produced by this function call. The initial state of `ans` is not specified, but it will be updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, where `K` is an index that is presumably defined elsewhere.

Since we do not have the exact return value of `func_2`, we cannot specify the exact contents of `times`. However, the execution of the given code updates `times`. 

The other variables `x`, `y`, and `ans` retain their values, with `ans` updated based on the computed `times`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is the sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is the sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
