According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 for the variable `y`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. The next value of `y` will be -998. 

The loop will execute one more time as long as `y` remains within the specified range. Since the next value of `y` is -998, it is still within the range of -1000 to 1000. 

There are no changes needed to the values of `x`, `K`, `ans`, or `times` for the next iteration, as they do not depend on the loop condition. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect the updated value of `y`.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
