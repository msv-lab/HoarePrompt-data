According to the code, the loop will execute for each integer in the range from -1000 to 1000, which includes both endpoints. Therefore, there are no restrictions on `y` for the loop to start executing. 

However, for `ans` to have a meaningful value at the end of the loop iterations, the list `times` must be non-empty, which means that the function `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)` should return a list that can produce a valid `ans`. 

Since `K` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N\), it assumes that \(N\) is defined and at least \(K\) elements exist in `times`. 

To ensure the loop can execute correctly:

1. `y` should iterate through its defined range without any additional constraints.
2. `K` must be defined and should be less than or equal to the length of `times` to avoid indexing errors.
3. We need to ensure that `times` has at least `K` elements.

Thus, the adjustments required for the state are as follows:

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000 (initial value for the loop), `K` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= len(times), `times` must be a non-empty sorted list generated from the results of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`**.
