According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1 to -998. 

Since the range defined is from -1000 to 1000, and the loop continues until `y` reaches 1000, the value of `y` can increment to -998 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
