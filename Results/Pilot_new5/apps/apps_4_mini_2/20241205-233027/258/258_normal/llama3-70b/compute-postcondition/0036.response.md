To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is updated to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`

The code provided is:
```
times.sort()
```

Now, we assume `func_2(x, y, x, y)` returns a list. The specifics of how `times` is updated depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not given. Therefore, we can only state that `times` is some list based on the function's output.

Since we do not know the contents of `times` specifically after the call to `func_2`, we can't determine the exact sorted order after calling `times.sort()`. However, we know that `times` changes its order to be sorted. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**.
