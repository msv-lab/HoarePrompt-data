According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `y` from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. The loop will execute again for the next value of `y`, which will be -999. The range specified allows for `y` to take values from -1000 to 1000, so for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be -999.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is sorted.**
