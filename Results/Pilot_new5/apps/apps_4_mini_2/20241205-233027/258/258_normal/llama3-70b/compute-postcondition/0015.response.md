According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). Since the current state indicates that `x` is -1000 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `x` will be -999 for the loop to execute again. 

The loop will continue to run as long as `x` is less than or equal to 1000. Since `y` remains unchanged through the iterations, and `K` is still a valid positive integer, it doesn't need to be modified for this iteration. The variable `ans` will also be based on `times`, which is derived from the results of `func_2`, but we do not need to change its state for the next iteration since its definition remains valid.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `x` to -999.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list generated from the results of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`**
