Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. 

### Issue:
1. The algorithm used in `func_3` only iterates over divisors of the difference \( |a - b| \). However, the optimal \( k \) to minimize the LCM could be greater than the difference. The code does not evaluate all possible values of \( k \) starting from 0 up to \( |a - b| \) or larger values.
  
### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
a = 1
b = 3
```
The least common multiples for different values of \( k \):
- For \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 3) = 3
- For \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 4) = 4
- For \( k = 2 \): LCM(3, 5) = 15
- For \( k = 3 \): LCM(4, 6) = 12

The smallest LCM occurs at \( k = 0 \) with LCM = 3.

However, if \( a \) and \( b \) were closer or if \( b \) were much larger, the optimal \( k \) might change significantly. The code currently does not explore values of \( k \) beyond \( \sqrt{diff} \) which can lead to missing the actual minimum.

Thus, the presence of this issue means the program does not comply with the requirements of the problem statement, leading to a verdict of **False**.
