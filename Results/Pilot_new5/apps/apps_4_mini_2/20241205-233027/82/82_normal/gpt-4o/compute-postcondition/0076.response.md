To analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state:

1. **Identify the initial state**: 
   - `a` is a positive integer
   - `b` is a positive integer
   - `diff` is at least 2
   - `candidate` is `diff // k`
   - `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`
   - `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`
   - `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`

2. **Impact of the code**:
   - The code updates `new_b` to a new value based on the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which calculates the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - After updating `new_b`, `current_lcm` is then recalculated using the newly updated `new_b` and the existing `new_a` by calling `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

3. **Values after execution**:
   - `new_b` is now updated to the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` now holds the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` using the updated `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is now updated to the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
