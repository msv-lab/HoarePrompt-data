Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_k` is set to `candidate` and `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`.***
