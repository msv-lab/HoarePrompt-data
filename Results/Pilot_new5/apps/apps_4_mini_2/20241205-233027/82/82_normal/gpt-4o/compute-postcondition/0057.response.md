According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. The loop can execute one more time if the current value of `k` is less than `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. 

Since we know that `diff` is at least 2, we can derive that `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be equal to the current value being used in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1.

If the last value of `k` was `current_k`, we need to set `k` to `current_k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

Thus, `k` must be set to `current_k + 1` and the condition `k <= int(math.sqrt(diff))` must hold true.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated across all candidates, with `min_k` as the candidate that provided this minimum value, `k` is `current_k + 1`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.**
