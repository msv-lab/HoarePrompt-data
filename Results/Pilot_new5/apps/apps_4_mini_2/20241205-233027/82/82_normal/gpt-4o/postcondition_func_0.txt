The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly computes the GCD even if `y` is initially 0, where it will return `x` as the GCD. Therefore, the function can handle cases where one or both inputs are 0 and still returns the appropriate GCD result.
