The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` can either be `2` or `diff // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
