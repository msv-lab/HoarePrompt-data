The code assigns `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. As a result, `min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` iterates over [1, diff], `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b)**.
