Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the candidate that provided this minimum value, `current_k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) - 1`, `k` is `current_k + 1` which is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, current_lcm is now the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, current_lcm is less than min_lcm or (current_lcm is equal to min_lcm and candidate is less than min_k); `min_k` is now equal to `candidate`.**
