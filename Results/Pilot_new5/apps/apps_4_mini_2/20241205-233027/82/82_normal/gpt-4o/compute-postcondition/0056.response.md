Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `diff` is at least 2 and divisible by 2, then `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated across all candidates, with `min_k` as the candidate that provided this minimum value.***
