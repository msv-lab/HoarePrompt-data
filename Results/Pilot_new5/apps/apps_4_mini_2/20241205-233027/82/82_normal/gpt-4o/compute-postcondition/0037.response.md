Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
