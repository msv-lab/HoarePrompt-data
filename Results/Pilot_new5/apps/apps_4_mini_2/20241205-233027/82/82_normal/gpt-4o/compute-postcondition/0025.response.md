The variable `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `candidate` is 1, this simplifies to `(b + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1`, which is equal to `b`. Therefore, `new_b` is assigned the value of `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is 1, `new_a` is equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `b`.**
