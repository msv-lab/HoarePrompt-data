Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, and `candidate` is `diff`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `diff`.***
