Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for each candidate, `min_k` is the candidate that provided this minimum value, and if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then the conditions regarding `min_lcm`, `min_k`, and `k` remain valid.***
