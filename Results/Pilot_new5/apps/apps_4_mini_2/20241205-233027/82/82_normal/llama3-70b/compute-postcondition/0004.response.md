According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is not zero (i.e., while `b` is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `a % b`, which is less than its original value and greater than 0. This means that `b` is already set to a value that is valid for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `b` is greater than 0 and the loop condition is `while b`, it can execute again without requiring any changes to the state.

State: **`a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to `a % b` (which is less than the original value of `b` and greater than 0)**
