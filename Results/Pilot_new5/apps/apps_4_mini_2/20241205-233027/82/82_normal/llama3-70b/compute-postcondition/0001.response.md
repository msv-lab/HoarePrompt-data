The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers constrained such that \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \). After executing the function body, it returns the result of the expression \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{func\_1}(a, b)} \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return the result of the multiplication of `a` and `b` divided by the result of another function `func_1` that is called with `a` and `b` as arguments. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, both positive integers. It returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the value returned by func_1(a, b).**
