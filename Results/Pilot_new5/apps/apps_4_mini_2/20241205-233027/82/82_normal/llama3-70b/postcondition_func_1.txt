The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where both values are in the range of 1 to 10^9. It returns the result of `a` multiplied by `b` divided by the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will cause a division by zero error, which is not handled in the function. Therefore, in cases where `func_1(a, b)` is 0, the function will raise an exception instead of returning a valid result.
