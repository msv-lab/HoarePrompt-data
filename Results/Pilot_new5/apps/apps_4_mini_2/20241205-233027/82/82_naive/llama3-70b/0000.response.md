To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem requires finding a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) that yield the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads inputs \( a \) and \( b \).
2. It initializes \( k \) to zero and computes the initial LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using `func_2`.
3. It enters a while loop where it checks if the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is less than the previously found minimum LCM.
4. If so, it updates the minimum LCM and continues to increment \( k \) until it finds a situation where the LCM does not decrease.
5. Finally, it prints \( k - 1 \).

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Output for \( k \)**: The program prints \( k - 1 \) at the end. However, if \( k \) was never incremented (i.e., if the minimum LCM was found at \( k = 0 \)), this will yield an incorrect output of \( -1 \). The output should be \( k \), not \( k - 1 \).

2. **Infinite Loop Possibility**: If there are continuous values of \( k \) yielding the same minimum LCM (which may happen), the program will not break out of the loop, leading to an infinite loop.

### Test Cases:
- For inputs \( 6 \) and \( 10 \), \( k = 2 \) gives the correct minimum LCM of \( 24 \).
- For inputs \( 21 \) and \( 31 \), \( k = 9 \) gives the correct minimum LCM.
- For inputs \( 5 \) and \( 10 \), \( k = 0 \) gives the correct minimum LCM of \( 10 \).

### Additional Case:
- If we test the edge case where \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \):
  - The expected output is \( k = 0 \) because \( LCM(1 + 0, 1 + 0) = LCM(1, 1) = 1 \) which is the smallest. However, if the loop does not correctly handle the stopping condition, it may yield an incorrect result or lead to an infinite loop.

Given these points, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading us to conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.
