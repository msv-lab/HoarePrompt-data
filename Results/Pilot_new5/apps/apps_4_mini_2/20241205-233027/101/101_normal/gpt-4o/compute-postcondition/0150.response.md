The variable `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`, which calculates the width of the frame based on the maximum and minimum column indices containing 'w'. The precondition variables remain unchanged except for `frame_width`. 

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.**
