Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', it is set to '+'.***
