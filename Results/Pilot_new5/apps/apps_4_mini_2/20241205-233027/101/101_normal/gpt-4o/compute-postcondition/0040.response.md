The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. In the initial state, `i` is 0, so `bottom` will become 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2**
