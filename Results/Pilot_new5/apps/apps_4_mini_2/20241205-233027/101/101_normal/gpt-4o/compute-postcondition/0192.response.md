Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and either `i` is equal to `top`, or `i` is equal to `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`. If `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now updated to '+'. If `result[i][j]` was not '.', there are no changes to `result[i][j]`.***
