The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which remains 0. Since `i` does not change, the value of `top` will also remain 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` must be greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 1.**
