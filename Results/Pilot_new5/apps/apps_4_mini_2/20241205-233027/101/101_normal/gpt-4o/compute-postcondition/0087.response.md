Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2` (where `k < m - 2), top` is equal to `i`, and `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged if `i` is less than `top`. If `i` is not less than `top`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
