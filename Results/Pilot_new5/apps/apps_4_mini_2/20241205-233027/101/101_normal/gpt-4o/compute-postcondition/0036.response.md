The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, both `top` and `bottom` will now also be set to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.**
