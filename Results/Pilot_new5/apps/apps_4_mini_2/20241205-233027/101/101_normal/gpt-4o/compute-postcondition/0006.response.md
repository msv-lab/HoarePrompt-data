The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since the initial state indicates that `j` is 0, both `left` and `right` will now be set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `left` and `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
