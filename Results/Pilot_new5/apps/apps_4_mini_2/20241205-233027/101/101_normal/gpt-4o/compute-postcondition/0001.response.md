According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (given 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000). Therefore, the loop will execute successfully.

At the start of the loop, the loop variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Since `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all `None` and do not affect the execution of the loop directly, they do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to note the following state adjustments:

- `i` is now 0 (indicating the first iteration of the loop).

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) do not need adjustments for the loop to execute as per the given conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0**
