Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2`, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to the value of `j`, while the values of `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `j` is not less than `left`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
