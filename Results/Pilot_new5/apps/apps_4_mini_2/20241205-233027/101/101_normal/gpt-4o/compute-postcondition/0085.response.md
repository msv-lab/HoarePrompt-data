The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is defined as `k + 2` with the constraint that `k < m - 2`, it implies that `j` is always greater than 2. Thus, both `left` and `right` will take the value of `j`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2`, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`.**
