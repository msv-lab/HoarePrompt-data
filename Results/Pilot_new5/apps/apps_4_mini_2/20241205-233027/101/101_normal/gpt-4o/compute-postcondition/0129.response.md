Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` are defined. If `top` is None, then `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `right`, and both are equal to `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, and `i` is 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, there are no changes to the variables; if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
