The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The initial conditions state that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are indices related to the presence of 'w', and `i` is 1 while `j` is updated to `j + 1` (which must be less than `m`). Since `i` is set to 1, it does not impact the other variables related to indices, but `bottom` now takes the value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are indices related to the presence of 'w'; `i` is 1; `j` is updated to `j + 1`, and `bottom` is now 1.

Output State: **`top`, `bottom` is 1, `left`, `right` are indices related to the presence of 'w'; `i` is 1; `j` is updated to `j + 1`.**
