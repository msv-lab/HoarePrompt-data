Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, `bottom` remains 0, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, `left` is updated to 1 and `right` is set to 1. If `top` is not None, `left` remains unchanged, but if `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is updated to `j` and `right` is set to `j`.***
