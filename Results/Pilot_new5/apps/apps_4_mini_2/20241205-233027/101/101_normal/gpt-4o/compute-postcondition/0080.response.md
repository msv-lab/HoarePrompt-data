Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`). If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`. Otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, and `left` remain unchanged.***
