The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` is less than `left`, which means that `j` is a value that could potentially be less than the minimum column index containing 'w'. After this assignment, `left` will now be equal to `j`, and the previous value of `left` is no longer valid. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`, and `left` is equal to `j`.**
