The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value at the position specified by the indices `i` and `j` in the `result` array. Given the initial state that `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, it changes to `'+'`. All other variables and conditions remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and either `i` is equal to `top`, or `i` is equal to `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`; `result[i][j]` is now '+'**.
