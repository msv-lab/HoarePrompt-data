According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over rows from `top` to `bottom`. For the loop to execute at least once, the values of `top` and `bottom` must satisfy the condition that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. Given that `bottom` is defined as the maximum row index containing 'w', and `top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', the state of `top` and `bottom` must be such that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. 

Since the problem states that `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, we know that `bottom - top + 1 >= 2` or equivalently `bottom - top >= 1`. This means that `bottom` must be at least `top + 1`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` is initialized to `top`, which is the starting index of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute correctly, the adjusted states need to clarify the relationship between `top` and `bottom`. 

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is `top`**
