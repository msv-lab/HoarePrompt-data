Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`). If `j` is less than `left`, then `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` remains unchanged, and `left` is updated to `j`. Otherwise, `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged and `left` is not affected.***
