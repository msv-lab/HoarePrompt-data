According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the specific value of `j`, but we know `j` must be less than `m`. Since `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Assuming `j` is currently at `k`, where `k < m - 1`, on the next iteration it becomes `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`)**
