The variable `left` is set to the value of `j`. Since `left` was previously set to `j + 1`, it now updates to `j`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the condition regarding `i` and `bottom` was not triggered based on the provided initial values.

Output State: **`top` is 1 or None, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j + 1`, `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 (and must be less than `m`.**
