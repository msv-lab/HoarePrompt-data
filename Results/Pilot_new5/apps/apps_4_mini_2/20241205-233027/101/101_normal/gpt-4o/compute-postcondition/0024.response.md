The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The previous value of `j` is 1, which is greater than the previous value of `right` (which was 0). Therefore, both `left` and `right` will become 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` must be greater than 1; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is 0; `bottom` is 0; `left` is 1; `right` is 1; `i` remains 0; `j` is 1.**
