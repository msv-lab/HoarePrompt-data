Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `j` is less than `left`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `left`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` also remain unchanged.***
