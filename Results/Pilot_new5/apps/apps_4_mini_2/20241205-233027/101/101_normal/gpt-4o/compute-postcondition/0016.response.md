Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `j` is less than `left` (which is now 0), then `i` remains greater than 0 and `j` is less than `left`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the state.***
