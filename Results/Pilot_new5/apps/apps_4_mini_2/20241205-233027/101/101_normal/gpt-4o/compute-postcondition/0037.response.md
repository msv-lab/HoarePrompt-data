The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial value of `j` is 2. Therefore, after execution, both `left` and `right` will also be equal to 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2.**
