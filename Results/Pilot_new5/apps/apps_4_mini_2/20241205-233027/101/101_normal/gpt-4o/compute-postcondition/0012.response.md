After executing the code `bottom = i`, the variable `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is given as 0 in the initial state, the value of `bottom` will now be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
