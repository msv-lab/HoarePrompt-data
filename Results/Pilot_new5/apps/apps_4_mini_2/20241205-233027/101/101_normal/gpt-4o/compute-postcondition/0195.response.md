The code assigns the value `'+'` to `result[i][j]`. The variables `i` and `j` are calculated from `top` and `left`. Specifically, `i` is `top + 2` and `j` is `left + 1`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not changed by this operation. 

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 1`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`; `result[i][j]` is '+'**
