The code creates a new list called `result`, where each element is a list created from the corresponding strings in `screen`. The `screen` variable remains unchanged as a list of strings, while `result` will be a list of lists, with each sublist containing the characters of the corresponding string from `screen`.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists created from `screen`.**
