The code assigns the value `'+'` to the position `result[i][j]`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation, but `result[i][j]` is updated. Here `i` is `top + 1` and `j` is `left + 1`, so the specific indices in the `result` array are determined by these calculations.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left + 1`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'**
