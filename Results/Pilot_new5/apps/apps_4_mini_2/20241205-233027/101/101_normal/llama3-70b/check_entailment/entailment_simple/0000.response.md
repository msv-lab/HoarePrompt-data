Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not entirely meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The calculation for `frame_size` is based on the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels. However, the correct frame should be a square that fully encompasses the white pixels, meaning both width and height should be sufficient to contain the furthest white pixels. The current implementation calculates the frame size as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which does not guarantee a square frame of the required size.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not check whether the calculated frame can fit within the monitor's dimensions. It only checks if the frame size exceeds either `n` or `m`, but it should also ensure that the frame does not exceed the monitor's bounds when placed at the `(min_x, min_y)` position.

3. **Handling of Valid Frame**: The program prints `-1` if the `frame_size` exceeds the monitor dimensions without necessarily confirming whether a valid frame can be constructed from the given white pixels. There can be a valid frame even if its size is close to the edges, but it should still be checked against the monitor boundary and the placement of all white pixels.

4. **Placement of Frame**: The logic for placing the frame (`+` characters) is not accurate. The program only replaces `.` with `+` at the borders defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`, but it doesn't account for the fact that the frame must consist of a border of width 1 around the white pixels.

5. **Output for Non-Frame Cases**: The program does not correctly handle the case where it is impossible to construct a frame around all white pixels. If no valid frame can be created, the expected output is `-1`, but the criteria for this are incorrectly implemented.

Due to these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to fulfill the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
