The variables `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` and `y` are part of the tuple from `white_pixels`, and `min_x` and `min_y` are already assigned to be the minimum values based on the input, the values of `max_x` and `max_y` will now reflect the greater of either their current state or the new values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `max_x` and `max_y`, while the other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 entry of tuples, `(x, y)` is the first tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**
