According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
