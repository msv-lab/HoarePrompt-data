The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to extreme values to facilitate finding the minimum and maximum coordinates later. The states of other variables (`n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples containing the coordinates `(i, j)` for each `pixels[i][j]` that is equal to `'w'`, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf').

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples containing the coordinates `(i, j)` for each `pixels[i][j]` that is equal to `'w'`, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf')**.
