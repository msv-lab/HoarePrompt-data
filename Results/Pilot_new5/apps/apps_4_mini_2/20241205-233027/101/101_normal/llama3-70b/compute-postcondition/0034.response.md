Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[0][1]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and if not, `pixels[0][1]` remains '.'***
