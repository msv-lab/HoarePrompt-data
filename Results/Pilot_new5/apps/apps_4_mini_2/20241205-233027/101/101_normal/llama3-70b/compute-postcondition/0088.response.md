Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2. If either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[2][2]` is '.', then `pixels[2][2]` is assigned the value '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][2]` is 'w', the state of the program remains unchanged for these variables. If `pixels[2][2]` is not 'w', then `pixels[2][2]` remains '.', with `n` still between 2 and 2000, `i` equal to 2, and `m` greater than 2.***
