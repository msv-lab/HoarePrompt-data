According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. To ensure that the loop executes, `m` must be at least 1, as the range for `j` starts from 0 and goes to `m-1`. If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000 and `i` is already set to 2, we only need to focus on `m`.

Additionally, before the loop starts, `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we should indicate that explicitly.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
