The code assigns the value `'+'` to the position `pixels[i][j]`. The variables affected in this operation are `i` and `j`, which are used as indices. The value of `i` is currently `0` and the value of `j` is `1`. The variable `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2000, and `m` is still greater than 1. The variable `j` remains unchanged at its value of `1`, while `pixels[0][1]` is now assigned the value `'+'`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `pixels[0][1]` is '+'**.
