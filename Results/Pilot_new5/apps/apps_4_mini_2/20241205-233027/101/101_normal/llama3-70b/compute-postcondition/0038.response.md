The code updates the `pixels` array at the position specified by the indices `i` and `j`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Since `pixels[i][j]` is being set to '.', the value at the specified location in the array is changed to this character. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `j`) do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and pixels[0][2] is '.'**
