The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the 2D list `pixels` at the indices `i` and `j`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1 and `j` is also 1, which means that the operation will specifically modify the element at `pixels[1][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` is '+'**.
