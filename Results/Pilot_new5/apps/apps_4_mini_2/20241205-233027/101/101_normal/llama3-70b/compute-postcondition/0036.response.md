The value at the position `pixels[i][j]` is set to the character `'+'`. The variable `i` is initially `0`, and `j` is `2`. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the value at `pixels[0][2]` is set to `'+'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[0][2]` is set to '+'**.
