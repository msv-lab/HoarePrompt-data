To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The program should identify the smallest square frame that:
   - Has a width of 1 pixel.
   - Does not go beyond the screen borders.
   - All white pixels ('w') must be located on the frame.
   - If there are no valid frames, the program should output `-1`.
  
### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the monitor and the pixel states.

2. **Finding White Pixels**:
   - It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels and correctly calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of those pixels.

3. **Frame Size Calculation**:
   - It computes the required frame size based on the maximum height and width derived from the white pixels found.

4. **Frame Placement**:
   - The program attempts to place the frame by iterating over the monitor pixel grid.
   - It sets '+' for the frame's border pixels only if they were originally black ('.').
   - It ensures that white pixels remain unchanged.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the modified monitor screen if a valid frame could be placed.
   - If the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program might fail in cases where:
  - There are multiple isolated white pixels, which cannot encapsulate a valid frame (the last condition checks for the frame size against the maximum dimensions, but there could be cases where the frame cannot fit).
  
For example, consider this test case:
```
3 3
.w.
.w.
...
```
Here, the only white pixels are at (0,1) and (1,1). The program will compute the frame size based on the range and attempt to create an encapsulated frame. However, since these pixels cannot form a valid frame of size 1 or more, the output should be `-1`, but the current logic would not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and potential edge cases where the program might not satisfy the requirements stated in the problem description:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly output `-1` when there are isolated white pixels that cannot form a valid frame.
