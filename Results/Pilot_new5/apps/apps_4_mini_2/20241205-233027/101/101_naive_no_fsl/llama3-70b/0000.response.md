To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code step by step in the context of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the resolution of the monitor and the pixel states correctly.

2. **Finding White Pixels**: It correctly identifies the coordinates of white pixels ('w') on the monitor.

3. **Calculating Frame Bounds**: The program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels. This is necessary to determine the smallest frame that could encompass all white pixels.

4. **Frame Size Calculation**: The frame size is determined based on the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels. This is consistent with the requirement to find the smallest possible frame.

5. **Frame Placement**: The program then attempts to place the '+' characters to represent the frame on the monitor. It updates the pixel states correctly based on the conditions specified (i.e., only placing '+' on the borders of the frame if the pixel was originally black).

6. **Output**: The program prints the modified pixel grid, which is expected.

However, there is a significant flaw in how the frame is drawn. The current implementation does not ensure that all edges of the frame are correctly created, especially when the frame's size is less than the maximum dimension of the monitor. 

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
.w.
.w.
...
```

Here, the expected output should be:
```
.w.
+w.
.w.
```
This means that the frame should only encompass the two white pixels, which are at positions (0,1) and (1,1).

If we run the provided program with this input, it will yield:
```
.w.
++.
.w.
```
This is incorrect because it incorrectly applies '+' to the entire row between the bounds of the white pixels without respecting the requirement that the frame only provides a border and should not cover non-white pixels in the same row or column.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
