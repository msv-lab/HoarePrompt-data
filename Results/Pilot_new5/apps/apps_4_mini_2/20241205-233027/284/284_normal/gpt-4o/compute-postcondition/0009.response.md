The value of `i` is assigned the value 5 directly. The other variables (`n` and `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is a positive integer larger than 3 that is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is a positive integer larger than 3 that is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.**
