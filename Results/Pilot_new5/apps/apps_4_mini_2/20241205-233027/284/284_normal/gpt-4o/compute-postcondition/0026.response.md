Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, if it is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1 and 3), or if it is divisible by 2 or 3. For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility against all integers of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of `x`. If none of these conditions indicate non-primality, it returns True, indicating that `x` is a prime number. Missing from the annotations is the handling of cases where `x` is specifically 2 or 3, which should return True, as well as the comprehensive prime check for larger values of `x`.**
