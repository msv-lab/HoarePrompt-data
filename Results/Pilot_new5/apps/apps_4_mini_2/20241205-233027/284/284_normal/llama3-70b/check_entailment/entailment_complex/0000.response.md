To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that for a given `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The input `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, and the output `m` must also be in the range from 1 to 1000. The program must output any suitable `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` from input.

2. **Loop Over `m`:**
   - It uses a loop to iterate `m` from 1 to 1000.

3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(num)` checks if `num` is a prime number.
   - It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 (which is appropriate since the smallest prime is 2).
   - It then checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

4. **Finding Non-Prime:**
   - In the loop, for each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1`.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False` (meaning `n * m + 1` is not prime), it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description:
- It correctly checks for each `m` whether `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.
- The function correctly identifies non-prime numbers while ensuring that the input conditions (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) are met.
- The loop continues until an appropriate `m` is found, guaranteeing that the output will be a valid integer.

### Conclusion:
Since the program effectively fulfills the criteria laid out in the problem description for any value of `n` in the specified range, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
