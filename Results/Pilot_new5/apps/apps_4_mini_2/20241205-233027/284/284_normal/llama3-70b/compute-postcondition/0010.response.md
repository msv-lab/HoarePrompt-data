According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than or equal to 9 and is an odd number, we need to determine the range for `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is presumably less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, we set `i` to `i + 1`, and we need to ensure that this new value does not exceed `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

To summarize:
- `num` is an odd integer between 9 and 1000, which means `int(num ** 0.5)` will also be a positive integer.
- We do not know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, but it must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Thus, if `i` = `k` before the next iteration, we can say that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `k + 1` and also must not surpass `int(num ** 0.5)`.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than or equal to 9 and is an odd number, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`**.
