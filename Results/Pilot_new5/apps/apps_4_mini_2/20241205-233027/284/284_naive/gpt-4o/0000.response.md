To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the code.

The problem requires finding a positive integer `m` such that for a given positive integer `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` results in a non-prime number. The range for `m` is from 1 to 1000.

The program starts by reading an integer `n` and then iterates through possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if that result is not a prime number using the `func_1` function. If `func_1` returns `False`, the program prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

Now let's scrutinize the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is responsible for determining if a number is prime:
1. It returns `False` for any number less than or equal to 1 (which is correct).
2. It returns `True` for 2 and 3 (which is also correct).
3. It checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3 and returns `False` if it is (correct).
4. It uses a loop to check for factors from 5 onward, which correctly identifies primes.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- The program needs to find at least one `m` such that `n * m + 1` is guaranteed to be non-prime within the range of `m` from 1 to 1000.
- For `n = 1`, `1 * m + 1` will always be `m + 1`, which can be prime (for example, when `m = 2`, it gives 3, which is prime). However, for `m = 3`, it gives 4, which is not prime. Thus, `m = 3` is a valid output.
- For `n = 2`, `2 * m + 1` gives odd numbers for any positive `m`, where the smallest odd prime is 3. For `m = 1`, it gives 3 (which is prime) and for `m = 2`, it gives 5 (also prime). However, for `m = 3`, it gives 7 (prime) and for `m = 4`, it gives 9 (not prime). Thus, `m = 4` works and is correctly identified.
- The range of `m` ensures that there will always be a suitable `m` since it is guaranteed in the problem description that a non-prime exists for any valid n.

Given the logic outlined above and the guaranteed existence of a suitable `m` for all valid inputs of `n`, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
