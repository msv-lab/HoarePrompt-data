The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` (between 2 and 40 inclusive). It calculates and returns the decimal value represented by the digits in that base. There are no checks for invalid digit values (i.e., digits being negative or greater than or equal to the base), which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
