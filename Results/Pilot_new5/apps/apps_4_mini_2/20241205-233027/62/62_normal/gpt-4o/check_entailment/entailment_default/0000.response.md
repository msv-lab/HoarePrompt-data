To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description
The program is supposed to compare two numbers represented in different bases, converting them to decimal before comparison.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers.
   - It then reads the digits of each number in order.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function converts a list of digits from a specified base to a decimal equivalent.
   - It does this by iterating over each digit, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to decimal, it compares the two decimal values and prints `<`, `>`, or `=` accordingly.

### Edge Cases
1. **Invalid Digits**: 
   - The function does not validate the digits provided against the base. If a digit is greater than or equal to the base or negative, it should ideally raise an error or handle it gracefully. The problem description specifies that `0 ≤ x_i < b_x` and `0 ≤ y_i < b_y`, but the code does not enforce this rule.

2. **Maximum Base Handling**:
   - The maximum base allowed is 40, meaning that any digits provided must be in the range of the base. If the digits are not within this range, the calculation will yield incorrect results.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints mention that the function does not check for invalid digit values. This aligns with the observation that the program lacks digit validation, which could lead to incorrect conclusions based on the provided inputs.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not handle cases where digits exceed their respective bases, it fails to adhere to the problem description in every potential case. An invalid digit can lead to an incorrect decimal conversion, producing misleading results.

Therefore, the final assessment is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where the digits provided could be invalid (i.e., greater than or equal to their respective bases), which could lead to incorrect results.
