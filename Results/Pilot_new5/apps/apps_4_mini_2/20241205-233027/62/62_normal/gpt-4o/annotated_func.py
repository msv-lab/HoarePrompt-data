#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, where each digit is non-negative and less than the base; base is an integer between 2 and 40, inclusive.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `decimal_value` is equal to the value represented by `digits` in the specified `base`.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns decimal_value, which is equal to the value represented by digits in the specified base between 2 and 40 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` (between 2 and 40 inclusive). It calculates and returns the decimal value represented by the digits in that base. There are no checks for invalid digit values (i.e., digits being negative or greater than or equal to the base), which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
