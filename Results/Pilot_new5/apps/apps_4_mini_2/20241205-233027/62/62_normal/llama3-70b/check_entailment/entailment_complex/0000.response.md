Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the digits of the numbers X and Y go beyond the base limits. Specifically, while the problem description states that all digits must be in the range from 0 to base-1, the function `func_1` does not verify whether the digits adhere to this constraint. 

For example, if a base `b_x` is 3, the valid digits should be 0, 1, or 2. If the input includes a digit like 3 or higher, the function would still compute a result without raising an error, leading to an incorrect representation of the number. This violates the contract outlined in the problem description, which ensures that provided digits must be valid for the specified base.

Hence, since the program can produce incorrect results due to this oversight, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
