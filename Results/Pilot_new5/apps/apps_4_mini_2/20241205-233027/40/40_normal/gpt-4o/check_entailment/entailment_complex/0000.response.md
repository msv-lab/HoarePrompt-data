The program is designed to determine the length of the longest substring of a given string \( s \) that is not a palindrome. Let's analyze each part of the program to see if it adheres to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program accepts a non-empty string \( s \) with at most 50 lowercase letters. This matches the problem description.

2. **Length Check**: 
   - The first condition checks if the length of \( s \) is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints `0`, which is correct since a string of length 1 is a palindrome, and thus there are no non-palindrome substrings.

3. **Palindrome Check**:
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1(s)` to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. This correctly identifies palindromes as required by the problem.

4. **Finding Non-Palindrome Substrings**:
   - The program checks:
     - If \( s \) is not a palindrome, it prints the length of \( s \).
     - If \( s \) is a palindrome, it checks the substrings \( s[1:] \) (all but the first character) and \( s[:-1] \) (all but the last character). If either of those is not a palindrome, it prints the length of \( s \) minus 1.
     - If both \( s[1:] \) and \( s[:-1] \) are palindromes, it prints `0`.

5. **Logic Verification**:
   - The check for the full string \( s \) ensures that if it is not a palindrome, the maximum non-palindromic substring is the string itself.
   - If \( s \) is a palindrome, removing either the first or last character can potentially yield a non-palindrome. If neither of those conditions holds true, it indicates that all possible substrings are palindromic, thus returning 0.

**Conclusion**:
The program accurately identifies the longest non-palindromic substring according to the specifications provided in the problem description. It handles edge cases correctly and covers all scenarios when checking for palindromic nature of the string and its substrings.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
