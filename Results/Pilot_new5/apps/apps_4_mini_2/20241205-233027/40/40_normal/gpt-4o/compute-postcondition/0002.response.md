The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` containing at most 50 lowercase English letters. It checks whether the string `s` is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards. The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` if it is not. The implementation covers all potential cases, given that `s` is guaranteed to be non-empty and consists solely of lowercase letters. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases since the function will always operate within the defined constraints of the input.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. **
