According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` from `i + 1`, which means `j` will start from 2 (since `i` is 1). The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 since `j` starts at 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will equal `n + 1`, meaning the loop will have run `n - i` times, which is `n - 1` (if `n` is 2). 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least 2,
- `j` will start at 2,
- `i` remains 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index `i`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**.
