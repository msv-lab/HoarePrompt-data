According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j`, which starts at `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, meaning `j` will start at 3. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `j` would be 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 4, the next value of `j` will be 4.

Thus, the updated state must reflect that `j` will now be 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions state that `n` is still greater than or equal to 4, while `s`, `substr`, and `max_len` remain unaffected.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`, `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, `i` remains 2, and `j` is 4.**
