The value of `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`, specifically `s[2:4]`. The initial state mentions that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, so the substring will be extracted from index 2 up to (but not including) index 4. The values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, and the condition regarding `substr` being not equal to its reverse remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`**.
