The value of `substr` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` (which is 2) up to index `j` (which is 3). This means `substr` will be equal to the character at index 2 of `s`. The values of `n`, `max_len`, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`.**
