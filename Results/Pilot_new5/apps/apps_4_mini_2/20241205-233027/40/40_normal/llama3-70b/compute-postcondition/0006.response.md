Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (which means `substr` is not a palindrome).***
