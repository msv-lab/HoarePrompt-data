According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is the first character of `s`**
