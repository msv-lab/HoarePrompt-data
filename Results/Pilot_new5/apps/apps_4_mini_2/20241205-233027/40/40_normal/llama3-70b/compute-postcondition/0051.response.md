The function `func` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, with a maximum length of 50 characters. It calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring within the string `s`. For every possible substring of `s`, it checks if the substring is not a palindrome. If it finds a non-palindromic substring, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length found. After iterating through all possible substrings, the function prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substring, returning 0 if no non-palindromic substring exists.

However, the function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the result. It also assumes that there will always be at least one non-palindromic substring unless the input string consists of a single repeated character. The function does not handle edge cases where the input string might be composed entirely of the same character (e.g., "aaaa"), which would lead to a return value of 0. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring. It prints this length, returning 0 if all substrings are palindromic. **
