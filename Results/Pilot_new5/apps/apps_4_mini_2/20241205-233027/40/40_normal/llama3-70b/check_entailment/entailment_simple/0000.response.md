Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here's an explanation of how it adheres to the stated requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s` composed of lowercase English letters, which is consistent with the input requirements specified in the problem description.

2. **Palindrome Checking**: The program uses the condition `substr != substr[::-1]` to check if a substring is not a palindrome. This effectively verifies the palindrome property by comparing the substring to its reverse.

3. **Substring Generation**: The program generates all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the starting index `i`, and the inner loop iterates over the ending index `j`, thus considering every possible substring `s[i:j]`.

4. **Tracking Maximum Length**: The program maintains a variable `max_len` to track the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found during the substring generation. It updates `max_len` whenever it finds a substring that is not a palindrome and is longer than the current maximum.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `max_len` if it is greater than zero; otherwise, it prints `0`. This aligns with the output requirements, as it returns the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or `0` if no such substring exists.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as:
   - If `s` is already a non-palindrome (like "mew"), it returns its full length.
   - If all substrings are palindromes (like "qqqqqqqq"), it appropriately returns `0`.

Thus, the program is correct as it meets all the conditions set out in the problem description for all potential input cases.
