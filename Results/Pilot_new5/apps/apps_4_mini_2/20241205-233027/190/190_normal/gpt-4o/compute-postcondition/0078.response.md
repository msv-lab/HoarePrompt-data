Postcondition: ***`current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` are integers, `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to 2.***
