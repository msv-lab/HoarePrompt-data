The `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. Given the current state, `length` is `a[0]`, and since `length` is greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of `length` is greater than 2, we can deduce that `length` is at least 3. The variable `t` is set to 1.

So the calculation for `current_cost` is as follows:
- `t + 1` equals `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
- Therefore, `current_cost` is incremented by `length - 2`.

The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2`, `length` is `a[0]` and is greater than or equal to 3.**
