Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 2, and `length` is the first integer in list `a`. If `length` is greater than 3, then `current_cost` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` is 1, and `length` is greater than 3.***
