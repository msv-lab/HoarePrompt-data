To analyze the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State Details**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is in the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).
   - The length of the list `a` is `n`, hence `length = n`.
   - `t` is equal to 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The operation `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` modifies the variable `current_cost`. 
   - By substituting the known values:
     - `length` is equal to `n`.
     - `t` is equal to 2, hence \(t + 1 = 3\).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     current\_cost += n - 3
     \]

3. **Impacted Variables**:
   - `current_cost` is updated by adding \(n - 3\) to its previous value.

4. **Output State**:
   - The variables `n`, `a`, and `t` retain their initial conditions.
   - The specific update to `current_cost` is that it now incorporates the value \(n - 3\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `t` is equal to 2; `current_cost` is updated by adding `n - 3`.**
