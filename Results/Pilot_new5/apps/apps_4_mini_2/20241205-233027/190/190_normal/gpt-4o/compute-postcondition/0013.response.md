Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, and `t` is 1. If `length` (which is `a[0]`) is less than `t - 1` (0), then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length` and `length` is set to `a[0]`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1` (greater than 2), `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2` while ensuring that `length` is 3 or more.***
