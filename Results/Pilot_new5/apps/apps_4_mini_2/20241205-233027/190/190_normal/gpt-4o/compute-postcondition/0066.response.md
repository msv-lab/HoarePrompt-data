The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` modifies the variable `current_cost`. The value of `t` is given as 2, which means that `t + 1` will be equal to 3. The variable `length` is the second integer in the list `a`, which can be determined from the initial state. The variable `current_cost` will be updated by adding `length - 3` to its previous value. 

Since the initial conditions specify that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 100, the exact previous value of `current_cost` is not specified but is still applicable in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the second integer in the list `a`; `t` is equal to 2; `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 3` to its previous value.**
