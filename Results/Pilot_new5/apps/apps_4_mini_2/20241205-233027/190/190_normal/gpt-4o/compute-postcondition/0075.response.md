Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in list `a` with respect to `t`, which is equal to 2. `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
