Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `min_cost` is updated accordingly, `best_t` remains 1, and `t` is adjusted as per the loop logic.***
