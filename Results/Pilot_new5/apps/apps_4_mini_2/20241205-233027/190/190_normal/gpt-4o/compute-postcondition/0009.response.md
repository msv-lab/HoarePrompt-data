Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, `length` is `a[0]`, and the value of `length` is greater than or equal to 0.***
