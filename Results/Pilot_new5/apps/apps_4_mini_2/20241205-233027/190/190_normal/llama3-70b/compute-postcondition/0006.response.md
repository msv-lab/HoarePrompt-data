The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The values of `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, `cost`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input; `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input; `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
