The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided output, it processes the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are positive real numbers constrained between 0.1 and 200.0, and each having exactly one digit after the decimal point. The function then returns a result based on these values. However, the specific output based on the conditions or calculations involving `x`, `y`, and `z` is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on the positive real numbers x, y, and z, which are constrained to be between 0.1 and 200.0 with exactly one digit after the decimal point.**
