The code snippet provided reads input from standard input, but does not modify any variables directly. The state of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains unchanged because no computations or assignments occur as a result of the code.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0, and each number has exactly one digit after the decimal point.**
