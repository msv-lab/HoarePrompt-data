The variable `a3` is assigned the value of `(x ** y) ** z`, which is equivalent to `x` raised to the power of `y`, and then the result raised to the power of `z`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are inputs. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a3` calculated based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `(x ** y) ** z`.**
