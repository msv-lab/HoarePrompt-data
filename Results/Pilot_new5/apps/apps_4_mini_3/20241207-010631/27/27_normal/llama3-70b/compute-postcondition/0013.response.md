The list `a` is defined to include the elements `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, `a6`, `a7`, `a8`, `a9`, `a10`, `a11`, and `a12`, where `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are equal to `x`, `a5`, `a6`, `a7` are equal to `y`, and `a9`, `a10`, `a11` are equal to `z`. However, `a8` is not defined in the initial state provided. 

The final item `a12` is defined as the value of `z` without any operations on it.

All variables other than `a` remain unchanged. Therefore:
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are equal to `x`
- `a5`, `a6`, `a7` are equal to `y`
- `a9`, `a10`, `a11` are equal to `z`
- `a12` is equal to `z`
- `a8` is undefined.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are equal to `x`; `a5`, `a6`, `a7` are equal to `y`; `a9`, `a10`, `a11` are equal to `z`; `a12` is equal to `z`; `a8` is undefined.**
