Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1. If `pixels[2][1]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `pixels[2][1]` is '.', indicating that the condition for 'w' was not met.***
