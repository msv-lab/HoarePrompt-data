Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes a grid of pixels (black and white) with dimensions specified by the user input. It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels and calculates a frame size that encompasses all white pixels. If the frame size exceeds the monitor's dimensions, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it modifies the grid to replace the edges of the frame with '+' signs (if they were black) and prints the modified grid. The function guarantees at least one white pixel is present, so there will always be valid coordinates for the frame calculations. **
