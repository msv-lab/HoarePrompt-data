To determine the output state after executing the code, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer input representing the number of lines.
   - `m` is an integer input representing the number of characters in each line.
   - `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from input.

2. **Code Execution Impact:**
   - The code creates a list `white_pixels` which is populated by a list comprehension.
   - The comprehension iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and each index `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For each position `(i, j)`, it checks if the character at `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'w'`.
   - If the condition is true, the tuple `(i, j)` is included in the `white_pixels` list.

3. **Previous Values Check:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the total number of lines.
   - `m` is an integer representing the total number of characters per line.
   - `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing `m` characters each.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The result, `white_pixels`, will be a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` corresponds to the positions of 'w' in the `pixels` matrix.
   - While the contents of `white_pixels` depend on the contents of `pixels`, the output state will reflect the construction of the `white_pixels` list based on the existing values of `n`, `m`, and `pixels`.

**Output State:** **`n` is an integer input representing the number of lines, `m` is an integer input representing the number of characters in each line, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the positions of 'w' in `pixels`.**
