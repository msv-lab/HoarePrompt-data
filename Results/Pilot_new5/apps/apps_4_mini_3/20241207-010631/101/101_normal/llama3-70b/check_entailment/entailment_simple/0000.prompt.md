You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function doesn't take any input arguments. The monitor resolution is represented as a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either a '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 0 elements. If `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` and `min_y` remain as float('inf'), while `max_x` and `max_y` remain as float('-inf').
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `pixels` is updated such that all positions on the edges defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y` are marked with '+' if they were originally '.', while the positions with 'w' remain unchanged, and all other positions are set to '.'; `i` is equal to `n - 1` after the last iteration, and `j` ranges from `0` to `m - 1` during the final processing of the last row.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` has been entirely printed row by row as strings, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is not applicable as the loop has completed all iterations.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`, respectively, and `frame_size` is defined as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, the output is -1. Otherwise, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, and the pixels have been entirely printed row by row as strings, with `i` equal to `n` and `j` not applicable as the loop has completed all iterations.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
