The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1 and `j` must be less than `m`. Therefore, the output state must reflect that the `pixels` array has been updated at the specified index.

Since `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged by this operation, they will still hold their initial states.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is less than `m`; `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**.
