Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; every element in `pixels[1]` has been checked. If `pixels[1][j]` was originally `'.'` and either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y`, `max_y`, then `pixels[1][j]` is updated to `'+'`; if `pixels[1][j]` was originally `'w'`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `pixels[1][j]` is `'.'`.**
