The code prints the rows of the `pixels` list, joining the elements of each row into a single string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for each row, `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` can range from 0 to m-1 during the loop execution.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for printing, `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` can range from 0 to m-1 during the loop execution.**
