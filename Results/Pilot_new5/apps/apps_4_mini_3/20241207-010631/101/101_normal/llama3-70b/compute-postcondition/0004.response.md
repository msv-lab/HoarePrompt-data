According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` collection. If `white_pixels` contains at least one element (i.e., at least one `(x, y)` pair), the loop will execute. Since `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to extreme values, they do not impact the ability of the loop to run. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `white_pixels` must contain at least one element, and the first `(x, y)` pair needs to be identified.

State: **`min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf'), `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 element, `(x, y)` is the first element in `white_pixels`**
