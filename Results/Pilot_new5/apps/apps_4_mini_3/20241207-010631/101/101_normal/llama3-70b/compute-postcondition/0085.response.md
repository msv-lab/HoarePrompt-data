The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, since no specific loop context is provided in the initial state, we cannot change the values of any variables. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
