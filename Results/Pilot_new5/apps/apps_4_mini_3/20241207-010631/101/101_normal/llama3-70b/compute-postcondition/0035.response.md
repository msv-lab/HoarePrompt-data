According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop will execute again for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, which means the loop has reached its end. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, leading it to be `m + 1`. However, the loop cannot execute again since `j` would not be less than `m`, and thus the loop cannot proceed.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1`**
