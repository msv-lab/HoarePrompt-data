Precondition: **The function doesn't take any input arguments. The monitor resolution is represented as a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either a '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.**
