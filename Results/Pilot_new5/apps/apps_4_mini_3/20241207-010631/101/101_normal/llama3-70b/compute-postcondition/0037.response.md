The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one. Since it does not change any of the variables directly, the previous values remain unchanged. The state of the program indicates that the loop is ongoing and that the current iteration has been skipped.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
