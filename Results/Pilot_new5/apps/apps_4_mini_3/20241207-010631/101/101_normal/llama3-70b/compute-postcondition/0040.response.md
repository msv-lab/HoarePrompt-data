Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or if `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and if `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifications to `pixels[i][j]`. If `pixels[i][j]` is neither `'w'` nor `'.'`, it is set to `'.'`.***
