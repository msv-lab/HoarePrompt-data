The statement `continue` indicates that the current iteration of a loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. In this scenario, the values of the variables remain unchanged as `continue` does not modify any variables directly. It simply affects the flow of control in the loop.

However, since `i` is currently 2 and `j` is 0, it's implied that the loop is active at this point, and the program will proceed to the next iteration. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `pixels[i][j]` remain valid, as they are not altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; neither `i` equals `min_x` nor `max_x`, nor `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`; `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
