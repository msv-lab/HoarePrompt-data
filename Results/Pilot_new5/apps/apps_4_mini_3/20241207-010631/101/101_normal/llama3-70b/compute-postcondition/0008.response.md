The code updates `min_x` and `min_y` by assigning them the minimum values between their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `min_x` and `max_x` are both initially `x`, and `min_y` and `max_y` are both initially `y`, the values of `min_x` and `min_y` will be determined based on the current values of `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Given that `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, and `max_y` is `y`, after the execution of the code:
- `min_x` will remain as `min(min_x, x)` which is `x`.
- `min_y` will remain as `min(min_y, y)` which is `y`.

Thus, both `min_x` and `min_y` could potentially change if `x` or `y` are lesser than their previous values, but as their initial values were set to `x` and `y`, they will only become those values if `x` or `y` is indeed lesser.

Output State: **`min_x` is the lesser of `x` and `min_x`, `min_y` is the lesser of `y` and `min_y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 elements, and `(x, y)` is the second element in `white_pixels`.**
