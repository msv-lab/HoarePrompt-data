The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the code does not change any variable values directly; it simply affects the control flow of the program. 

Since we are assuming this code is inside a loop, and given the initial conditions of the variables, we can determine that the `continue` statement results in skipping the current iteration without altering any of the variables defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1 and we have skipped the current iteration of the loop.**
