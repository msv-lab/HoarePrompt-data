The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no variables being changed or assigned new values in this snippet, the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, and `j` remain unchanged. The program will still evaluate the next iteration of the loop in which this `continue` statement is placed.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)` where `n` and `m` are both greater than 0; `j` is `m`.**
