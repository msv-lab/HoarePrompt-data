The variable `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The initial conditions indicate that `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, and `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and that `pixels[i][j]` was previously `'.'`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 (either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`), `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is now '+'**.
