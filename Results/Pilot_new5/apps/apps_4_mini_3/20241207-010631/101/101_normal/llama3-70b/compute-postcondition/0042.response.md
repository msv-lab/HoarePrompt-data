According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the total number of iterations defined by `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to 0, the loop will execute for the first time, and on each iteration, `i` will increment by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1**
