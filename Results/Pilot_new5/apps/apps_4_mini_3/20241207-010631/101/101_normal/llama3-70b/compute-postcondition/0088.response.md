Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` holds true and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. If the condition is false and `pixels[2][2]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, `pixels[2][2]` is set to '.' indicating that the conditions are not satisfied.***
