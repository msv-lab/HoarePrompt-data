The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position defined by `pixels[i][j]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, thus the specific position in the `pixels` array is being updated to `'+'`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`; and the value of `pixels[2][0]` is '+'**.
