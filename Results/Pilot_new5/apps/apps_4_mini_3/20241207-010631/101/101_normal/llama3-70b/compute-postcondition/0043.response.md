According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Given that `i` is already set to 1 and does not affect the loop execution, we only need to ensure that `m` is defined and greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `m` must be at least 1.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
