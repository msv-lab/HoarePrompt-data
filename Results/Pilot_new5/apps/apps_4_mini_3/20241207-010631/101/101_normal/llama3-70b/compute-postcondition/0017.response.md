Postcondition: ***`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, and `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, and `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`***
