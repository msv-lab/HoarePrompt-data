The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `bottom` will also take on this value of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` is set to 0, `right` is set to `right`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m` if `i` (which is `n`) is less than `top`, and now `bottom` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` is set to 0, `right` is set to `right`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m` if `i` (which is `n`) is less than `top`.**
