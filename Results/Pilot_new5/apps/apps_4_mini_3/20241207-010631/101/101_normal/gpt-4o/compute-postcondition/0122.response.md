Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` remains set to `n`, `left` is set to 0, `right` is set to `right`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m` if `i` (which is `n`) is less than `top`.***
