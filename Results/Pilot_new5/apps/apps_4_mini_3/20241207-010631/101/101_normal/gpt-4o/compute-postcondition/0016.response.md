Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` and `bottom` are equal to `i`. If the current value of `j` is less than `left` (which is now equal to `j`), then `j` is updated to `left`.***
