Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom` are both set to `n`, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, and `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1. Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to be equal to `j`, while `left`, `bottom`, and `top` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, all values remain unchanged.***
