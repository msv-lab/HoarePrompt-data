The variable `frame_height` is assigned the value of `bottom - top + 1`. The variables `top` and `bottom` are defined and not None, so their values can be used for the calculation. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `screen` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is determined by the calculated value of `frame_height`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all defined and not None; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`.**
