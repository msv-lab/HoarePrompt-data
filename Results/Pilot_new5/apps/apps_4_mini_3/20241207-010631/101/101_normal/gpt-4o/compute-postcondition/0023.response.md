In the provided code snippet, `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of the variable `i`. The initial state specifies that `j` is 1, but it does not define the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `screen` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Since `i` can take any integer value, we denote it generically as `i`. Therefore, both `top` and `bottom` will equal `i` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 1, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`.**
