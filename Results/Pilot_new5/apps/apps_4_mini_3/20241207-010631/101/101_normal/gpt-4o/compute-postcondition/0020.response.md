Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to 0, and `top` and `bottom` are equal to `i`, with `j` remaining 0. Otherwise, `top` and `bottom` are equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `j` is updated to the value of `left`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `j` is updated to `left`, and `right` is set equal to `j`.***
