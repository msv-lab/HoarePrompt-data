The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the code only affects `bottom`. The initial conditions regarding `top` and `i` do not alter the assignment of `bottom`, so we simply note that `bottom` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 1, `bottom` is equal to `i`.**
