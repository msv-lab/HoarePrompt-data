Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` is greater than `top`, `i` is equal to `top + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is now `left`, and the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `left` or the current value of `j` is equal to `right`. The character at `result[i][j]` is a '.'***
