The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `top` becomes equal to `n`. The other variables retain their previous values after this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and the current value of `i` is less than `top`.**
