The variables `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. As `n` is an integer that can range from 1 to 2000, both `top` and `bottom` will now take on the value of `n`. Other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions still apply.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is unchanged, `right` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
