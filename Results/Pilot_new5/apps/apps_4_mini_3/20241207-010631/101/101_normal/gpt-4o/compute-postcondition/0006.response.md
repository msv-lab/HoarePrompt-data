The variables `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Therefore, after executing the code, both `left` and `right` will be equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
