Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, if `j` (which is `m`) is less than `left` (which is `m`), then `left` is updated to `m`, while `right` remains unchanged and `i` remains equal to `n`. If `j` is not less than `left`, then `i` remains equal to `n` and no changes occur to the other variables.***
