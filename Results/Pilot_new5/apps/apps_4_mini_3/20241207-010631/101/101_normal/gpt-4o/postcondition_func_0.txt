The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen` containing characters `'.'` and `'w'`. It determines the smallest rectangle (frame) that can enclose all the `'w'` characters in `screen`. If no valid rectangle can be formed (either due to the absence of `'w'` characters, or if the rectangle dimensions are less than 2), it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns a modified version of `screen` with the border of the rectangle marked with `'+'` characters, while the interior remains unchanged. If no edges are updated, the original `screen` is returned unchanged.
