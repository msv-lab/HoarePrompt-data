Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and if the current value of `i` is less than `top`, then `i` remains unchanged.***
