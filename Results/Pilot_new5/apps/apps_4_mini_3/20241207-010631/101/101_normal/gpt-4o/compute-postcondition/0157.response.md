Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is defined, `bottom` is defined, `left` is defined, `right` is defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` must be greater than `top`, `i` is the current value of `top`, and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. The current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`.***
