The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Since `n` is defined to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, the new value of `bottom` becomes equal to `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is either None or equal to `n`; `bottom` is equal to `n`; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is equal to `m + 1; `bottom` is equal to `n`.**
