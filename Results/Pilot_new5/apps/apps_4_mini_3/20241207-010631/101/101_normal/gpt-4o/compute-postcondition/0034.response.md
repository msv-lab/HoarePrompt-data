Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', and `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `i`, with `top` and `bottom` equal to `i` and both `left` and `right` equal to 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `j` is greater than `right`, there is no change to the variables. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `j` is less than or equal to `right`, there is also no change to the variables. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
