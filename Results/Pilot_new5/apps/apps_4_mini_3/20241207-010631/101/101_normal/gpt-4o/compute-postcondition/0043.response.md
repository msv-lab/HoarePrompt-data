Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, and `left` is 2. If `j` is less than `left`, then the conditions regarding `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`.***
