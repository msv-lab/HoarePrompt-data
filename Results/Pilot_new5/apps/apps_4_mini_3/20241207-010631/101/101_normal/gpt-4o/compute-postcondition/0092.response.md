The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is equal to 2, the value of `right` will now also be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is either `None` (if `i` is not less than `top`) or equal to `n` (if `i` is less than `top`), `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 2.**
