Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, and `bottom` is equal to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` and `bottom` both take the value of `i`.***
