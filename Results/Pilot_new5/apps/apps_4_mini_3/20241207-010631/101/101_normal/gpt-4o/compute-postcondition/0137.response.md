Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is either None or equal to `n`; `bottom` is equal to `n`; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; and `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` remains unchanged.***
