Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to `n`, `left` is updated to 2, `right` is updated to 2, `i` remains equal to `n`, and `j` remains equal to 2. If `top` is not None, then `top` is either `None` (if `i` is not less than `top`) or remains equal to `n` (if `i` is less than `top`), `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 1, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous `right`. Otherwise, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` retain their values.***
