The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `top` now is equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is unchanged, `left` is unchanged, `right` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
