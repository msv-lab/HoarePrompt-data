Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Frame Size Condition**: The program checks if the `frame_height` or `frame_width` is less than 2 and returns -1 in such cases. However, the problem states that a valid frame of size 1 (which consists of just a single pixel) can exist. The program should allow for frames of size 1 when `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` correspond to the positions of 'w' characters without necessarily checking for a minimum size of 2. The condition `if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2)` is too strict and prevents valid cases from being returned.

2. **Return Condition**: Since there can be scenarios where the white pixels ('w') form a single line (either horizontally or vertically), the function should allow for the output of a valid frame even if it doesn't meet the minimum dimension check. The program's logic incorrectly disqualifies valid frames, leading to a potential array of output that does not satisfy the conditions laid out in the description.

3. **Inconsistent Outputs**: The current implementation may produce an incorrect output of -1 when a valid frame of size 1 could be drawn around the white pixels in cases where the white pixels are only on the border or are isolated.

To summarize, the program fails to accommodate the case where the frame consists of a single pixel border around white pixels. This leads to incorrect behavior as per the problem description, thus demonstrating that the implementation is not correct in all scenarios.
