Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `j` is less than `left`, then `top` is updated to equal `i`, `bottom` is updated to equal `i`, `left` is set to the value of `j`, and `right` remains the maximum column index of 'w'. The current value of `j` is greater than `right`.***
