Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `top` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to be equal to `j`, while `left`, `bottom`, and `top` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top` remain unchanged.***
