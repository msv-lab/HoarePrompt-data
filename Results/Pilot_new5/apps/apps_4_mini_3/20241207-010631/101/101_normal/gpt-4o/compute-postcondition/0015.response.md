The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial conditions state that `j` is less than `left`, but after the assignment, `left` will now hold the value of `j`. The conditions regarding `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `left` and indicate the relationship with `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and the current value of `j` is less than `left` (which is now equal to `j`).**
