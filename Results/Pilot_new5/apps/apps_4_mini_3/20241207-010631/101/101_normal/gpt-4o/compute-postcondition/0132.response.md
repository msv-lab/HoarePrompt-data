The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, both `top` and `bottom` will now hold the value of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` must be equal to `m + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` must be equal to `m + 1.**
