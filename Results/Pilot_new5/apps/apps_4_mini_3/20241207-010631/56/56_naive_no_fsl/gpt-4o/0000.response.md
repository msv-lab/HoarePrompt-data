To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we need to carefully analyze the code and identify any potential issues.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program must find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of these integers equals `n`.
2. The largest integer in the result should be as small as possible.
3. Among all valid sequences, it must output the lexicographically largest one.
4. If no such sequence exists, it should return "No".

### Code Analysis:
- The program reads input values for `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If it is, it returns "No", which is correct because you cannot have more components than the total sum.
- It constructs a list of bit positions (powers of 2) that sum up to `n`.
- If the number of unique powers of 2 (stored in `bits`) is greater than `k`, it returns "No" since you can't create a valid sequence with more distinct powers than `k`.
- If the number of bits is less than `k`, it attempts to split the smallest bit into two smaller bits until the number of bits is equal to `k`.
- Finally, it sorts the bits in descending order and outputs them.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Negative Powers of 2 Handling**: The program does not handle cases where negative powers of 2 could be necessary when `k` is greater than the number of unique powers obtained from `n`. For instance, when `n` is small (like `1`) and `k` is large (`2`), it should be able to output negative powers correctly. However, the logic applied might not correctly manage indices when splitting bits.

2. **Lexicographic Order**: The code sorts the `bits` array in descending order before returning it. While this is a step towards ensuring the output is lexicographically largest, it may not handle all configurations correctly after the splitting operation.

3. **Edge Cases**: The edge case where `n` is `1` and `k` is `2` should return "Yes" with `-1 -1`, but the current implementation might not produce the correct output efficiently when handling larger `k` values.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
If we consider the input:
```
1 2
```
The expected output should be:
```
Yes
-1 -1
```
However, the logic in the `while` loop might not correctly generate this output for `k > 1` when the existing bit count is less than `k`. The program could end up still returning "No" or fail to produce the needed sequence.

### Conclusion:
Due to the reasons outlined above, particularly in handling certain edge cases and the potential failure to produce valid output sequences, I will conclude the correctness of the program as follows:

Correctness: **False**
