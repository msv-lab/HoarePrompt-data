Postcondition: ***`n` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is the number of iterations executed, and `k` remains a positive integer. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then 'No' has been printed. If the length of `a` is equal to `k`, then `a` is the sorted list of the first `k` elements from the previous list of last `i` values of `n.bit_length() - 1` in descending order.***
