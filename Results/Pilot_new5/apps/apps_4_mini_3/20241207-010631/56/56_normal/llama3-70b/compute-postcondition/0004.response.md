The variable `a` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and their relationship (that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`) still holds. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `a` is an empty list.**
