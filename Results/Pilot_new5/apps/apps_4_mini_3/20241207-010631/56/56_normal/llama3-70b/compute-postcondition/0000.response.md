The variable `n` is assigned a new value and the variable `k` is assigned a new value based on the input that is provided as a space-separated string, which is then converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten, and we do not know the specific values assigned from the input. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer that is assigned a new value based on input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input.**
