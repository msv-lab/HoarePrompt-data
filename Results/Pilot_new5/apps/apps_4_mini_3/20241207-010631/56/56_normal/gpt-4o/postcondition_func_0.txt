The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`. It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, returning 'No' if true. It then counts the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. If there are more bits set to 1 than `k`, it returns 'No'. If there are fewer or equal bits, it expands the list of bits to exactly `k` by duplicating the smallest bit until the size of the list equals `k`. Finally, the function returns 'Yes' followed by the `k` bit indices sorted in descending order. The function does not handle cases where `n` is zero, which may introduce unexpected behavior.
