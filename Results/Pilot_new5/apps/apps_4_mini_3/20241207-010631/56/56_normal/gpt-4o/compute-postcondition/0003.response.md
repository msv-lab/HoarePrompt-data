The code initializes an empty list called `bits`. The previous states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.**
