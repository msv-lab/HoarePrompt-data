The value of `smallest` is used to calculate a new value that will be appended to the list `bits`. Specifically, the new value added to `bits` is `smallest - 1`, which means the last element of `bits` before the append operation (denoted as `smallest`) is decreased by 1 and then added to the list. The previous state of the `bits` list is modified by this operation, but other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`smallest` is the last element of `bits` before pop, `bits` is the list with the new element `smallest - 1` appended.**
