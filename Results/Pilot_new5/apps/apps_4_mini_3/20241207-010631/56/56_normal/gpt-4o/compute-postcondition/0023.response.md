The variable `smallest` is assigned the value of the last element of `bits` by executing `bits.pop()`. This means that the last element of the list `bits` is removed and assigned to `smallest`. After this operation, `bits` will have one less element than it initially did. The precondition indicates that `k` must be greater than the length of `bits` after removing the last element, and `smallest` holds the value of the last element prior to the operation.

Output State: **`smallest` is the last element of `bits` before pop, `bits` is the list with one less element, and `k` must be greater than `len(bits)` after the operation.**
