The provided Python program indeed attempts to solve the problem as described. However, there are critical aspects of the problem description that are not correctly addressed by the implementation.

1. **Checking if `k` is greater than `n`:** The program immediately returns "No" if `k` is greater than `n`. This is incorrect because it does not consider that it is possible to represent `n` as a sum of powers of 2 with potentially negative powers (which correspond to fractions). The problem states that `k` integers can potentially include negative integers, meaning the program's initial check is overly restrictive.

2. **Lexicographically largest sequence:** The program correctly expands the `bits` array using the smallest indices, but it does not guarantee that the sequence it constructs is lexicographically largest among valid sequences. It simply duplicates the smallest bit without checking the overall constraints. The necessary logic for ensuring that the sequence is not just valid, but also the lexicographically largest is not implemented correctly.

3. **Handling when `len(bits) < k`:** The solution does not consider the potential for negative powers to fill the gap to reach exactly `k` integers. If `n` can be expressed as a sum of positive powers of two, but the length is not sufficient, the program should have logic to include negative powers to reach exactly `k` integers while still satisfying the lexicographical order requirement.

4. **Returning "Yes" and the appropriate sequence:** The program does not handle the edge case where `n` can be expressed in such a way that using negative powers would lead to the required sequence length of `k`, as illustrated in the problem description (for example, for `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output is `-1 -1`).

Given these points, the implementation does not fully meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. It misses handling cases where negative powers of two are necessary to reach the required count `k`, and it does not ensure that the output is lexicographically the largest possible sequence when there are multiple valid outputs.

Correctness: **False**
