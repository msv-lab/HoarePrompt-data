According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `b`, which starts from `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is at least 3 and `b` is at least `a`. 

To determine how the state needs to change for the loop to execute one more time, we need to evaluate the conditions based on the current value of `b` and the range for `b`.

Given that `b` can take values from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `(n - a) // 2`. If `b` is currently at `(n - a) // 2`, the loop will not execute again because it would exceed the upper limit.

Thus, we must increment `b` to the next value. If `b` is currently equal to `(n - a) // 2`, for the loop to execute again, we need to increase the upper bound of `b` by ensuring that `n` is sufficient to allow for another iteration.

Therefore, if `b` is currently at most `(n - a) // 2`, then it can be incremented by 1. Hence, `b` will need to equal `a + 1` if `b` was initially `a`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is still 1, `b` is `a + 1`, which is at least 2**.
