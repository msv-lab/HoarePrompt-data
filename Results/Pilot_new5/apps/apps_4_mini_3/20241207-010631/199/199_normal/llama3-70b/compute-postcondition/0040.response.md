Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) equals `n`, with `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 2` and `b` ranging from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. The function also ensures that `a` and `b` are not equal.**
