The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `ways` is set to 1 if `a` is not equal to 2 and `n` equals 4; otherwise, `ways` remains 0. Since `a` is 1 and `n` is at least 3, if we assume `n` equals 4, `ways` starts at 1. Therefore, after the operation, `ways` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 2**
