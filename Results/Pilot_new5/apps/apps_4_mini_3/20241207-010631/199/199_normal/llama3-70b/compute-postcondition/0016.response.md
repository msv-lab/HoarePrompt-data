The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial values indicate that `n` must be at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (1, b) found, `a` is 2, and `b` is 2. Since `a` is not equal to `b`, it means that there was at least one valid pair found that satisfies the equation. 

Given that `ways` is incremented by 1, we need to consider the previous value of `ways` (which is not explicitly stated but is at least 0) and now it will be one unit greater. 

Thus, the output state is updated with the new value of `ways` while keeping the other variables as they were. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (1, b) found plus 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2.**
