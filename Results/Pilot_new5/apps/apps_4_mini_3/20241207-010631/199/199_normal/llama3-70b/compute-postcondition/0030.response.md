According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `b` and the upper limit of the range that is determined by the expression `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 3 and `b` is also 3. Since `n` is greater than 7, we need to calculate the upper limit for `b`: 

1. Substitute `a` into the expression for the range: `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`. 
2. Since `n` is greater than 7, the minimum value for `n` could be 8, which gives us an upper limit for `b` of `(8 - 3) // 2 + 1 = 3`.
3. Currently, `b` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be increased by 1 to 4. 
4. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must allow a valid upper limit when `b` is 4, requiring `n` to be at least `2 * (3 + 4) = 14`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 14, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n`, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
