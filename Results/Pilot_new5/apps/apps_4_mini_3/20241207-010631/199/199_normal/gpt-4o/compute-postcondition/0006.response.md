To analyze the impact of the code, we take the following steps:

1. The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
2. The initial values are given as:
   - `count` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6
   - `a` is 1
   - `b` is 1

3. The expression inside the parentheses evaluates as follows:
   - `a + b` = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Therefore, `2 * (a + b)` = 2 * 2 = 4.

4. Now we compute `rem`:
   - Thus, `rem = n - 4`.

5. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `rem` will be:
   - For the minimum case, if `n = 6`, `rem` will be 6 - 4 = 2.
   - For any greater value of `n`, `rem` will also be positive.

6. The values of `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.**
