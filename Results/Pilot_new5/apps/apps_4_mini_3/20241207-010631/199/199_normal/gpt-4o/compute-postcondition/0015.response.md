`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so after the operation, the new value of `count` will be 2. The values of `rem`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`count` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * a`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 1`, `b` is `previous_value_of_a + 1` (which is `a`)**
