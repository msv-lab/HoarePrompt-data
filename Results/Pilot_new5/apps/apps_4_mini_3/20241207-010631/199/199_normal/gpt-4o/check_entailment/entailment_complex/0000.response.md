The program is meant to count the number of distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four positive integer parts such that it can form a rectangle but not a square. 

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the stick. The constraint `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9` is correctly acknowledged in the comments, and the code checks if `n` is less than 6 to return 0 since it is impossible to form four positive parts with lengths summing up to `n` if `n < 6`.

2. **Counting valid pairs**:
   - The loop iterates through possible values for `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. This is correct because for forming a rectangle using four parts, we can pair lengths (two pairs of lengths).
   - The code assigns `b` the same value as `a`, which aligns with the requirement of forming pairs of lengths.
   - It calculates the remainder `rem` to determine the leftover length after accounting for the lengths already assigned to `a` and `b`. This part is vital as it checks if the remaining length can be split into two equal lengths (the other two sides of the rectangle).

3. **Conditions for Valid Pairs**:
   - The condition checks if `rem > 0` and `rem % 2 == 0`, which ensures that the remainder can be split into two equal lengths (each of length `rem // 2`).
   - The additional condition `if a != rem // 2` ensures that the rectangle is not a square (i.e., `a` should not equal the length of the other two sides).

4. **Counting**:
   - The function correctly increments the count for each valid configuration that meets the required conditions.

5. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns the count of valid configurations which aligns with the problem requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies configurations of stick lengths that can form rectangles but not squares based on the criteria given in the problem description. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.

Correctness: **True**
