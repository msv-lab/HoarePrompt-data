To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code and also consider different input cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
Pasha needs to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. Each part has a positive integer length.
2. The parts can form a rectangle but cannot form a square.

### Program Analysis:
The given program is as follows:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Initial Check**: If `n < 6`, it returns `0`, which is correct since it's impossible to form four positive integer parts.
2. **Loop Over Possible Values of `a`**: The loop iterates over possible lengths for part `a`, and also sets `b` to be equal to `a`. This means we consider pairs of lengths `{a, a, x, x}`.
3. **Remaining Length Calculation**: The program calculates the remainder length `rem` after taking `2 * (a + b)`, which simplifies to `n - 4*a`.
4. **Conditions**:
   - It checks whether `rem > 0` and if `rem` is even, which ensures `x` can be a positive integer.
   - It then ensures that `a` is not equal to half of `rem` to avoid creating a square `{x, x, x, x}`.

### Potential Cases for Failure:
1. **Case with n=10**: 
   - For `n = 10`, the loop iterates with `a = 1` to `2`. 
   - For `a = 2`, it calculates `rem = 10 - 4*2 = 2`. 
   - Here, `2 // 2 == 1` (which means `x` would equal `1`), so it satisfies the conditions and wrongly counts `{2, 2, 1, 1}`. But this forms a square `1, 1, 1, 1`, which is incorrect.
   
2. **Case with n=14**: 
   - For `n = 14`, it checks all values for `a = 1, 2, 3`. 
   - At `a = 3`, it finds valid parts but would include configurations leading to squares.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for various inputs, primarily because it does not accurately prevent configurations that could lead to squares.

Correctness: **False**.
