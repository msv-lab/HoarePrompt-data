Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation when there are insufficient 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides available to fill the '?' placeholders properly. 

Consider the input case:
```
n = 8
s = "A??G??CT"
```

In this case, the current count for nucleotides is:
- 'A': 1
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 1

This means we need:
- 1 more 'A'
- 1 more 'C'
- 1 more 'G'
- 1 more 'T'

The string contains 4 '?' characters. According to the logic in the code, it will replace the '?' characters in a way that each type of nucleotide is balanced, resulting in a valid output, such as:
```
Output: "AAGGCTCT"
```

However, if we take another input case:
```
n = 8
s = "A??G?GCT"
```
Here, we have:
- 'A': 1
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 2
- 'T': 1

We need:
- 1 more 'A'
- 1 more 'C'
- 0 more 'G'
- 1 more 'T'

This means we can replace the '?' characters with 'A', 'C', and 'T', but we only have one '?' left after placing one for 'G'. The program may still try to fill one more 'G' or any other character incorrectly, leading to an invalid output or not satisfying the equal count requirement.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results, confirming that the correctness is indeed **False**.
