The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is -2, `c` is set to '?', `res` is updated to `res + nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
