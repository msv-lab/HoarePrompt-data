To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
1. The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the genome) and a string `s` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
2. Each of the four types of nucleotides should appear an equal number of times in the final decoded genome.
3. The output should either be a valid decoded genome or "===" if it's impossible to achieve the desired balance.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `n` and `s` correctly, which matches the input requirements.

2. **Counting Existing Nucleotides**:
   - It initializes a count for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'.
   - It correctly counts the occurrences of these nucleotides in `s` while ignoring '?'.

3. **Calculating Needed Counts**:
   - The average count for each nucleotide type is calculated as `n // 4`.
   - It updates `count` to reflect how many additional nucleotides of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are needed by subtracting the current count from `avg`.

4. **Replacing '?'**:
   - The program constructs the result string `res` by iterating through `s`.
   - For each '?', it replaces it with an available nucleotide if there are still nucleotides needed (i.e., `count[nc] > 0`).
   - If the character is already one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', it directly appends it to `res`.

5. **Final Check for Completeness**:
   - After constructing `res`, it checks if any of the counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' are still greater than zero. If so, it prints "===" indicating that not all nucleotides can be balanced. If all counts are zero, it prints the constructed genome.

### Conclusion:
- The algorithm correctly implements the necessary steps to ensure that the output string meets the requirement of having equal representations of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after replacing '?'.
- It correctly outputs "===" when it is not possible to balance the counts due to an insufficient number of '?' or an excess of certain nucleotides.

The program handles all edge cases as explained in the problem description, including situations where no '?' is present or when the number of '?' is insufficient to balance the existing nucleotides. 

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**

The program adheres to the problem description and handles all specified requirements appropriately.
