Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the second character of the string `s`, and the remaining length of `s` is at least `n - 1`. If the count of `c` in `s` is greater than 0, `res` is updated to `res + nc`, and count[nc] is decremented by 1, leading to a modified state of `res` and `count[nc]` after execution.***
