Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is updated such that if `c` is 'A', it becomes {'A': 1, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}; if `c` is 'C', it becomes {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}; if `c` is 'G', it becomes {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}; if `c` is 'T', it becomes {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 1}. If `c` is not one of these characters, there is no change to `count` as `c` is not '?'.***
