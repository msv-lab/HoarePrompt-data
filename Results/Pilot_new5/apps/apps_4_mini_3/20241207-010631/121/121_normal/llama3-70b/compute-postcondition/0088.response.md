Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `res` contains the original characters of `s`, with each '?' replaced by characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' up to their required counts; `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` will be greater than 0, indicating that not all characters have been used as needed to balance the '?' characters.***
