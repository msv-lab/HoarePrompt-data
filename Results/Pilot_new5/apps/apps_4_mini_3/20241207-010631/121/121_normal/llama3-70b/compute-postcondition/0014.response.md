The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `n // 4`, which is the integer division of `n` by 4. The value of `avg` will depend on the specific value of `n` within the range of 4 to 255. The states of other variables (`s` and `count`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State will include the computed value of `avg`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`; `avg` is `n // 4`.**
