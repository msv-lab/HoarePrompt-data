The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the second character of the string `s`, `res` is updated as `res + 'C'`, `count['C']` is one less than its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
