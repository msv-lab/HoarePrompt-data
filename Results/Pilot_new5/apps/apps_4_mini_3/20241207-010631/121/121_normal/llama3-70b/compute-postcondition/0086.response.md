Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the last character of `s`; if `c` is '?', then `res` contains the characters from 'ACGT' that were present in `count`, appended in the order of 'ACGT', and `count` reflects the remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after the loop. Otherwise, `res` is updated to include the last character `c`, and `count` remains unchanged.***
