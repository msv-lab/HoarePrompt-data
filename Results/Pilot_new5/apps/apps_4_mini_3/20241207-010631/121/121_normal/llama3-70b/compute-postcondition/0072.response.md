Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is the last character of `s`. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, the value at index `nc` in `count` is decremented by 1, while `res` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
