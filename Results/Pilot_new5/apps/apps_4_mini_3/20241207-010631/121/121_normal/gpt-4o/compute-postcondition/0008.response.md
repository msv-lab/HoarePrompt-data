`target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`, where `n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]` and is divisible by 4. Thus, `target_count` will be equal to `data[0] // 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `n` is divisible by 4, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.**
