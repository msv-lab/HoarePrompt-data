Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary containing at least 2 of the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and `char` is the second key in `counts` with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns nothing. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
