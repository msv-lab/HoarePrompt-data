The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is at `i + 3`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable with at least `i + 3` characters, `char` is the next character in `counts`, and `result[i]` is updated to `char`, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
