The line of code `counts[char] += 1` increments the count of `char` in the `counts` iterable by 1. The precondition states that `char` is the next character in `counts`, implying that `char` is a valid key in the `counts` iterable. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at `i + 2`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, `char` is the next character in `counts`, `result[i]` is now equal to `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.**
