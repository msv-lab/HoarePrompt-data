You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 4 and 255, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None, as there is no value specified to return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, and `n` is divisible by 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary {'A': count of 'A' in `s`, 'C': count of 'C' in `s`, 'G': count of 'G' in `s`, 'T': count of 'T' in `s`}. The sum of `counts['A']`, `counts['C']`, `counts['G']`, and `counts['T']` is equal to `n`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary containing counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' that are all less than or equal to `target_count`, `char` is the last key in `counts`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `result` is a string of length `n` where all '?' are replaced by characters from `counts` such that each character in `counts` appears no more than `target_count` times, `counts` contains the final counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after filling `result`, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It verifies if `n` is divisible by 4; if not, it prints '===' and returns None. If `n` is divisible by 4, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and ensures that none of these characters exceed `n // 4` in count. It then replaces any '?' in `s` with the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' as needed to meet the count requirement, and finally prints the modified string. The function does not return any value but will print '===' if any character exceeds the allowed count or if `n` is not divisible by 4.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
