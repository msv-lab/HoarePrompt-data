Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1` and `i` is at `i + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed. If `result[i]` is a question mark, then `counts` is a non-empty iterable with at least `i + k` characters, and `result` contains the characters from `counts` for which `counts[char]` was less than `target_count`, incremented accordingly.***
