Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary containing at least 2 of the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns None, and if not, there is no specified return value.***
