Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `result` has at least `i + 2` characters, and `counts` contains at least one more character. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
