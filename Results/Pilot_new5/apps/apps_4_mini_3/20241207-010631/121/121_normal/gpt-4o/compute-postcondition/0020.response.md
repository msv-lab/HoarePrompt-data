Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary {'A': count of 'A' in `s`, 'C': count of 'C' in `s`, 'G': count of 'G' in `s`, 'T': count of 'T' in `s`}. The sum of `counts['A']`, `counts['C']`, `counts['G']`, and `counts['T']` is equal to `n`.**
