The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at `i + 1`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, `char` is the first character in `counts`, the current value of `counts[char]` is now equal to its previous value plus 1, and `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
