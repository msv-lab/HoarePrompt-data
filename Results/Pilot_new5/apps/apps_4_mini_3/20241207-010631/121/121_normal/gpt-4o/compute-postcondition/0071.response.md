The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The conditions regarding the initial state still hold true. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `result` has at least `i + 2` characters, `counts` contains at least one more character, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
