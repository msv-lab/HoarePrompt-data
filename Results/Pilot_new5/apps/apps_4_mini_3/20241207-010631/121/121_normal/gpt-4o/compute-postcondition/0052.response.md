The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `result[2]` is equal to `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
