Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `result` must have at least `i + 1` characters, and `counts` must not be empty. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is now greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1 and still less than `target_count`, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
