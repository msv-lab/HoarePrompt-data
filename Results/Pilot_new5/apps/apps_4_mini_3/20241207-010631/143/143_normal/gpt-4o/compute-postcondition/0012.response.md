According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to 30 inclusive. The current state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `i` is now 2, and the loop condition allows it to execute while `i` is less than or equal to 30, we do not need to change the conditions regarding `n` or `dp`, as they are relevant to the values being processed within the loop and are not directly affected by the increment of `i`.

Thus, the updated state reflecting these adjustments should be:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 2, for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to `max_cost`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`**
