The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it, where `i` is currently 28. The previous value of `current_cost` is unknown, but it now becomes `current_cost + dp[28]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, after executing the code, `current_cost` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 28, `current_cost` is updated to current_cost + dp[28], `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28])**
