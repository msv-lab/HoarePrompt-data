The code `current_cost += dp[i]` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. The variable `i` is 30, so the value added to `current_cost` will be `dp[30]`. The other variables, including `n`, `answer`, and `L`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `current_cost`, which is now `current_cost + dp[30]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 30, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is `max_cost`, `current_cost` is the previous value plus `dp[30]`, and the current value of `L` is greater than or equal to 1 << 30.**
