The operation `L -= 1 << i` updates the variable `L` by subtracting the value of `1` shifted left by `i` bits (which is equivalent to `2**i`). Given that `i` is initially `28`, the expression `1 << 28` evaluates to `268435456`. 

Now, we update `L` as follows:
- `L` is decreased by `268435456`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so we keep their previous states:

- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30)
- `i` is 28
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`
- `answer` is updated to `min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28])`

Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `L` while preserving the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 28, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`, `answer` is updated to `min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28]), L is updated to L - 268435456**
