In the given code, `dp[i]` is being updated based on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1]`. For each `i`, `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1]` multiplied by 2. The initial state describes that `dp[i]` is already updated for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, and for values from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is set to `max_cost`.

Since `n` is between 1 and 30 and `i` starts at 1, the code will affect the values of `dp[i]` for `i` equal to `n`, `n+1`, ..., up to 30, depending on the previously defined values of `dp[i - 1]`.

Let's summarize the impact step by step:

1. For `i = n`, `dp[n]` will be updated to `min(dp[n], dp[n - 1] * 2)`.
2. For `i = n + 1`, `dp[n + 1]` will be updated to `min(dp[n + 1], dp[n] * 2)`.
3. This pattern continues until `i = 30`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unaffected, and we don't have the specific values for `dp[i]` before the operation. However, we know that `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` has already been updated, and values from `n` to 30 are initially set to `max_cost`.

Therefore, the output state is all the information that remains valid after the execution of the code, which includes the conditions for `dp[i]` for all applicable indices:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 1; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to `max_cost`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`.**
