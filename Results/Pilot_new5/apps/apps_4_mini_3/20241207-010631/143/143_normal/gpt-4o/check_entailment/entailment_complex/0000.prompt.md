You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), L is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and costs is a list of n integers where each c_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, and `dp[i]` remains equal to `max_cost` for `i` from `n` to 30.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 31; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 0, `dp` remains updated accordingly, `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on `dp[i]` values, and `answer` is the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop, stored in the variable 'answer'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of positive integers `costs`. It computes and returns the minimum cost based on a dynamic programming approach, where it considers both the costs provided in the list and the doubling of previous costs. The function effectively handles cases where `L` may be greater than the maximum representable value based on the number of bits calculated in the iterations. It ensures that the output reflects the minimum accumulated cost while adjusting for the available budget `L`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
