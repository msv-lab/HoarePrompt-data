The variable `vol` is assigned the value of \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is initialized to 0, we replace `j` with 0:

\[
vol = 2^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
\]

The values of other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of L + 1 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**.
