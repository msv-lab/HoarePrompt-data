According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is structured to iterate `n` times. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, the loop variable `j` will be initialized to 0 (the first index in the range). Therefore, for the loop to be executed properly, the state of `j` needs to be defined.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that dp[1] contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `1` using the first `n` items, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
