Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) representing the number of available options, a positive integer `L` (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) as a target volume, and a list `costs` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the costs associated with each option. It calculates the minimum cost to achieve exactly volume `L` using combinations of the powers of 2 (volume options). If it is not possible to achieve volume `L`, the function returns -1.**
