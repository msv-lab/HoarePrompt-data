The variable `costs` is assigned a list of integers converted from the input taken as a space-separated string. The integers in `costs` correspond to the inputs from the user. The values of `n`, `L`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `costs` is now defined. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers derived from input.**
