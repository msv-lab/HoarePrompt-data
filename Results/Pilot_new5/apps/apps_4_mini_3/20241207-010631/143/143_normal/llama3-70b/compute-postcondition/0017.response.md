Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers with at least 2 elements, `costs` is a list of integers, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `vol` is equal to 2. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` and `costs[j]`.***
