To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we analyze the provided information.

The loop structure is:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Key Variables:
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30
- `i`: currently set to 3
- The loop variable `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. **n**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **j**: At the start of the loop, the loop variable `j` will be initialized to 0 on the first iteration.

### Initial State:
- Current state indicates `i` is 3, which is not directly influencing the execution of the loop but could be relevant in the loop body.
- As `n` is already stated to be between 1 and 30, it meets the condition for executing the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
Since `n` is already within the correct bounds (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30), and `j` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, no further adjustments are necessary regarding `n` or `j`. 

### Conclusion:
The current state is sufficient for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can document the state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `2` using the first `n` items, `i` is 3, `j` will be initialized to 0**
