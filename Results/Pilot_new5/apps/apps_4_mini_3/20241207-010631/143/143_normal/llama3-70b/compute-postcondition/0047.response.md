Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, and `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of 2 using the first `n` items. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i` (which is 3), then `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[2]`.***
