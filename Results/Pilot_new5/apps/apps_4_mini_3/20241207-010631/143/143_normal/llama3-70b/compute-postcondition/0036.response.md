The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` calculates the value of `vol` based on the value of `j`. Since `j` is initialized to 0, the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. `2 ** j` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which is `1`.
2. Then, `1 - 1` results in `0`.

The value of `vol` becomes `0`. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is updated with the new value of `vol`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `2` using the first `n` items, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**.
