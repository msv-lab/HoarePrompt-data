Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of 2 using the first `n` items, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1. If `vol` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2] + costs[1]`.***
