Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that dp[1] contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `1` using the first `n` items, and `i` is 1. If `i` is less than the minimum volume represented by `2^0 - 1`, then `dp[1]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
