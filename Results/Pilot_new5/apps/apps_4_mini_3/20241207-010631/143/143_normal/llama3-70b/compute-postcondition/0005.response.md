According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is confirmed to be in the range of 1 to 30, this condition is satisfied. The variable `j` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop.

Since `i` is already set to 1 before the loop, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly and does not need adjustment. It’s also important to note that the initial state of `dp` doesn't impact the loop's execution.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we can summarize that `j` will start at 0 during the first iteration and will increment until it reaches `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of L + 1 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
