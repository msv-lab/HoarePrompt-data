In the code snippet, `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 1, we can compute the value of `vol`:

1. Calculate `2 ** j`, where `j` is 1:
   - `2 ** 1 = 2`
   
2. Now subtract 1 from the result:
   - `vol = 2 - 1 = 1`

The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `2` using the first `n` items, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**.
