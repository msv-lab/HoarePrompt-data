Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `costs` is a list of integers. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` for some `j`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
