The variable `j` is assigned the value of `n`. In this case, `j` is equal to `n`, which is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`. Therefore, `2 ** j` is equal to `2 ** n`, which results in a value between `2^1 = 2` and `2^30`. The calculation for `vol` becomes `2 ** n - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, `L` is a positive integer such that `L ≥ 2`, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `j` is `n`, and `vol` is equal to `2 ** n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, `L` is a positive integer such that `L ≥ 2`, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `j` is `n`, and `vol` is equal to `2 ** n - 1`.**
