Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[j]`. If `vol` is greater than `i`, no changes are made.***
