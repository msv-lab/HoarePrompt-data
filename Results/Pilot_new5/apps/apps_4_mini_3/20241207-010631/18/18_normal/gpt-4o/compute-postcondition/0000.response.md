The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned based on the input provided to the program. The input is split into three integers using the `map` function, which converts the string representations of the numbers into integers. The previous constraints ensure that the values remain within specified bounds after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
