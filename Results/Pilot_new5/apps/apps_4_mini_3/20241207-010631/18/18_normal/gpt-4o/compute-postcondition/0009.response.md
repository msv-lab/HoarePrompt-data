Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `t` are input integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, then the value of `t` is printed. Otherwise, if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, then `k` is printed. If `t` is greater than `n`, the printed result is `n + k - t`, which results in a negative integer.***
