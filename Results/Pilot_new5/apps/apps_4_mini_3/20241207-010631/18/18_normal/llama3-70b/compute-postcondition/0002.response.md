The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`. All three parameters are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The function does not return any explicit output in the provided information. 

Given the absence of specific output conditions, we cannot describe any return values or cases for the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept three integers, `n`, `k`, and `t`, under the specified constraints, but the return value is not defined in the provided context.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, where n, k, and t are integers with specified constraints, but does not return any defined output.**
