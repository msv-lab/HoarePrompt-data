The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned new values based on the input, which will be three integers. The previous constraints still hold: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. The output state will reflect the updated values for `n`, `k`, and `t`, which are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`.**
