The values of `n` and `k` are reassigned from the input provided through `map(int, input().split())`. This means that both `n` and `k` will take on new integer values based on user input. The string `s` remains unchanged in this statement. The output state thus reflects the new values of `n` and `k`, while `s` retains its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is updated to an integer based on input, `k` is updated to an integer based on input, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of length n representing the colors of the baloons**.
