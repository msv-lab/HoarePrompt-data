Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers, `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), and a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. This is consistent with the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Counting Colors**: It uses a dictionary `color_count` to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`. This ensures that the program correctly tracks how many balloons there are of each color, which is necessary to determine if they can be distributed without upsetting any friends.

3. **Maximum Color Count Check**: After counting the colors, the program calculates `max_color_count`, which is the maximum number of balloons of any single color. It then checks if this value is less than or equal to `k`. This directly corresponds to the problem's requirement of ensuring that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color.

4. **Output**: The program outputs 'YES' if all balloons can be distributed without any friend getting two of the same color and 'NO' otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the expected output specified in the problem description.

### Edge Cases
- If `k` is greater than or equal to the maximum count of any single color, the program will correctly output 'YES'.
- If any color exceeds `k`, it will output 'NO', which also adheres to the requirements.

Overall, the logic and flow of the program cater to all potential edge cases specified by the problem description and ensure that the output is correct based on the inputs provided. Hence, the program is correct.
