The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables or affect the state of the program. Therefore, the only output is the printed message while all other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers based on input; `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase letters; `color_count` is a dictionary where the keys are unique characters from `s` and the values are their counts; `max_color_count` is the maximum value from `color_count.values()`, which is less than or equal to `k`; 'YES' has been printed.**
