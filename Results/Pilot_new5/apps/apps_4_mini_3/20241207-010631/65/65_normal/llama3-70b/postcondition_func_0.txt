The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), and a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the balloons can be distributed among friends without any friend receiving more than one of the same color. If the maximum count exceeds `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that at least one friend would receive more than one balloon of the same color.
