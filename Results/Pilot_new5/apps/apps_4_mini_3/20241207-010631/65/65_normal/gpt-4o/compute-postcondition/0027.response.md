Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` has at least one more value, and `can_distribute` is True. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is set to False, `count` is the next value in `color_count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
