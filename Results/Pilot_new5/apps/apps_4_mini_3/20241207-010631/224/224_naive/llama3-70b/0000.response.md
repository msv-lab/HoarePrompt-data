To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code step-by-step and check if it adheres to the requirements set forth in the description. 

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Definition of `f(p)`**: This function calculates the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes of a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
2. **Definition of `f_max(n)`**: This is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of these integers.
3. **Output Requirement**: We need to count how many permutations yield `f(p)` equal to `f_max(n)`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and works as expected.
  
2. **Function `func_2(n)`**: This computes the maximum GCD from 1 to `n`. However, the logic used in the loop is incorrect. The maximum GCD of the prefix elements will always be equal to `n` because the maximum GCD of the longest prefix of numbers from 1 to n is `n` itself.

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: This logic attempts to calculate the number of permutations that lead to the max `f(p)`. However, since `func_2(n)` does not correctly compute `f_max(n)`, the result from `func_3` will also be incorrect.

### Example Case:
Let's test with `n = 2`:
- Permutations of `[1, 2]`: 
  1. `[1, 2]` -> GCDs: [1, 1] -> `f(p) = 1`
  2. `[2, 1]` -> GCDs: [2, 1] -> `f(p) = 2`
  
  Thus, `f_max(2) = 2`, which means there should be 1 permutation that yields `f(p) = 2`. However, the result from the program will not be correct because `func_2(n)` will erroneously compute `f_max(n)`.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not accurately compute `f_max(n)` and therefore will produce incorrect results for many values of `n`. The failure in `func_2(n)` directly affects the validity of the output.

Correctness: **False**.
