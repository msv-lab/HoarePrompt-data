The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value from a sequence of calls to `func_1`, starting with `func_1(0, 1)` and subsequently passing the maximum value computed so far (`res`) along with the current index `i` for each value from 2 to `n`. It returns this maximum value after evaluating all calls.
