The statement `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. However, since `MOD` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[j]`. Additionally, the other variables remain unchanged during this operation. The initial conditions remain valid after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD` but its exact value is unknown.**
