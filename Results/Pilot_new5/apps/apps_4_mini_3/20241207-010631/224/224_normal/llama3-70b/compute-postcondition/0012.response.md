The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged since there is no other assignment or operation affecting them in this code snippet.

Initial State specifies that `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, so `j` must be at least 0. The variable `dp[j]` is updated by the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
