According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined in the loop. The loop starts at `j` equal to `f_max_n` and decrements down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which must be greater than or equal to `1`. Since `j` is being decremented by `1` in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to `f_max_n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `f_max_n - 1`, and `f_max_n` must still be greater than or equal to `1` to ensure `j` remains non-negative.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % MOD`**
