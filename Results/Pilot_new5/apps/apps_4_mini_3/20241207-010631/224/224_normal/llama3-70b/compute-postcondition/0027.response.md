The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The value of `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the updated value of `dp[j]` will depend on the previous value of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Given that `dp[j]` is modified, the output state reflects the change in `dp[j]`, while all other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**
