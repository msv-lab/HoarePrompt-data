According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. 

To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. So, `i` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; `dp` is updated such that for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1, `dp[j]` is the sum of the original `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
