According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. 

Furthermore, `n` is constrained such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, which means for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`). 

Thus, the state must reflect that `i` is now 3, and `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and for each `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of original `dp[j]` and original `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
