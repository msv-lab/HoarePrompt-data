The variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The previous value of `dp[j]` is unknown, but since `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` will now hold the value of its previous state plus the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
