According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1. The loop can continue executing as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, and in the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented to `f_max_n - 1`. Additionally, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure that the loop can start executing in the first place.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`**
