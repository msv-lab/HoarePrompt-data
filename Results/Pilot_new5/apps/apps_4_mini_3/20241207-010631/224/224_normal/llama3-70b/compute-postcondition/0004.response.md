To determine if the loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `f_max_n` and how it affects the loop execution. The loop is defined to iterate from `f_max_n` down to 1 (inclusive), which means `f_max_n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `i` is 1

We need to ensure that `f_max_n` is set to a value that allows the loop to run. Since we don't have any specific value for `f_max_n`, it needs to be defined to be at least 1.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute would be:
- `f_max_n` must be at least 1.
- `j` will be initialized to `f_max_n` at the start of the loop.

So the final state adjustment would be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
