Let's analyze the code and output hints in relation to the problem description:

The problem description requires us to compute the maximum value of the function \( f(p) \) over all permutations of the integers from 1 to \( n \), and then count how many permutations yield that maximum value.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two positive integers `a` and `b`.
   - The output description confirms that it handles positive integers correctly. However, it does state that it assumes the inputs are positive, which might not be valid if the problem context allows zero values.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the maximum GCD from the sequence formed by calling `func_1` with pairs of numbers up to `n`.
   - The output description suggests that it starts with `func_1(0, 1)`, which is an edge case that could lead to unexpected behavior since `0` is not a positive integer. The maximum might end up being misleading because of this.

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**:
   - This function employs dynamic programming to count the permutations based on the maximum value obtained.
   - The output description mentions that it does not handle the case when `f_max_n` is less than 1 correctly. In the context of the problem, `f_max_n` should always be at least 1, but the lack of safeguards could lead to runtime errors if that assumption is violated.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints provided for each function agree with the corresponding code, but they also point out potential weaknesses:
  - For `func_2`, if `n = 2`, the GCD calls would be problematic due to the `0` in the initial computation.
  - For `func_3`, without checks for `f_max_n < 1`, it could lead to incorrect results or errors, as the assumption may not hold in all cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description correctly in every potential case. Specifically:
- The assumption in `func_1` that inputs are always positive may not hold.
- The initial call in `func_2` with `0` could lead to misleading results, as GCD involving zero is not typically considered valid in the same context as positive integers.
- The lack of handling for `f_max_n < 1` in `func_3` could lead to errors or incorrect outputs.

Thus, the program has edge cases where it does not behave as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
