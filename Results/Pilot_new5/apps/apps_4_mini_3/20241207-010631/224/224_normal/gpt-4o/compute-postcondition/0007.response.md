The loop computes the product of all integers from 2 to `n`, taking the result modulo `mod`. The loop will execute a number of times depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is exactly 2, the loop will execute once, and `result` will be `2 % mod`. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute `n - 1` times, resulting in `result` being equal to the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.

If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than 2), `result` will remain as its initial value of 1.

Output State: **`result` is equal to the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer.**
