According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1 (since it is stated that `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. The character at index `i` will be checked to see if it is a vowel or not, but since we are only updating the state for the next iteration, we don't need to make any changes to the properties of `s`, `prev_pos`, or `max_jump`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 2, `i` is 2**
