The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently set to 1. The values of `s`, `max_jump`, and the conditions regarding their states remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prev_pos`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string that must have a length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1 - prev_pos), `prev_pos` is 1**
