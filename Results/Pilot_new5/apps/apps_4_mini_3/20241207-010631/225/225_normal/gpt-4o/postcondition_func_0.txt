The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters and returns the maximum distance (jump) between consecutive vowels in the string. If there are no vowels, it returns the length of the string as the maximum jump. It calculates the maximum jump by considering the distance from the last vowel found to the end of the string as well.
