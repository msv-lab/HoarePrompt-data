To analyze the code and its effect on the initial state, we have:

- Initial values:
  - `s` is a non-empty string
  - `i` is 0
  - `s[i]` is a vowel
  - `prev_pos` is not defined or its value is unknown
  - `max_jump` is not defined or its value is unknown

The line of code:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
```
This line assigns `max_jump` the maximum value between its current value and the result of `i - prev_pos`.

Since `i` is currently `0`, the expression simplifies to:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, 0 - prev_pos) => max_jump = max(max_jump, -prev_pos)
```
The exact value of `max_jump` after execution depends on the initial value of `max_jump` and the value of `prev_pos`. We can only state that if `prev_pos` is known, `max_jump` will be updated to either its current value or a value that is at most `-prev_pos`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state summarizes the unchanged variables and the condition for the updated variable.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, -prev_pos)**
