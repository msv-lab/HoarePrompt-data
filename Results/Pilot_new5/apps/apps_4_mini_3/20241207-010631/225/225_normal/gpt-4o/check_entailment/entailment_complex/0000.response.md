To determine whether the provided program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description Recap
The Grasshopper must jump on vowels in a given string consisting of capital English letters. The goal is to find the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels. The vowels are defined as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s`.
2. **Vowel Set**: It defines a set of vowels.
3. **Logic**:
   - It initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1.
   - It iterates over the string, checking for vowels:
     - If a vowel is found, it calculates the distance from the last vowel (or start) to the current vowel and updates `max_jump` if this distance is greater.
     - It updates `prev_pos` to the index of the current vowel.
   - After the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel found to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` accordingly.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum jump calculated.

### Verification Against Requirements
- The program properly initializes the necessary variables and calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels.
- It also handles the case when no vowels are present by returning the length of the string as the maximum jump.
- The final output represents the minimum jump ability the Grasshopper needs in terms of the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, which satisfies the problem's requirements.
  
### Cases to Consider
1. For a string with no vowels, `max_jump` will effectively become the length of the string, which is correct.
2. For a string with multiple vowels, the distances between them are correctly calculated and the maximum is returned.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description by effectively determining the minimum jump ability in all cases it is designed to handle.

Correctness: **True**
