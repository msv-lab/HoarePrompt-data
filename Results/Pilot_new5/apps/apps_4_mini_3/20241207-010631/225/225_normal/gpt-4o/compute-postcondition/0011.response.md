Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `1 - prev_pos`, with `prev_pos` set to 1. If the character at index `i` is not a vowel, no changes occur.***
