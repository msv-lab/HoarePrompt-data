The variable `max_jump` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the other variables `s`, `vowels`, or `n`. The values of `s`, `vowels`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `max_jump` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `max_jump` is 0.**
