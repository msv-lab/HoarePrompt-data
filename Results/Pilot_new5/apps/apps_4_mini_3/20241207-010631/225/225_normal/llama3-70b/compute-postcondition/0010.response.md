In the provided code snippet, `max_jump` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated value. The calculated value is determined by the indices of the current position `i` and the last vowel found at `last_vowel`.

Given the conditions:
- `max_jump` is initially `0`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `last_vowel` is greater than or equal to `0`.

The value of `max_jump` will be updated as follows:
- The value of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` will be calculated. Since `i` is `0`, this simplifies to `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, where `last_vowel` is non-negative. 

Thus, if `last_vowel` is `0`, the result is `1`. If `last_vowel` is greater than `0`, the result will be less than or equal to `1`.
- The new value of `max_jump` will be the maximum of its current value (which is `0`) and the calculated value. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to at least `1` if `last_vowel` is `0` or `last_vowel` is `1`.

The output state will reflect these updates, while maintaining the other precondition values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is at least 1, and `last_vowel` is greater than or equal to 0.**
