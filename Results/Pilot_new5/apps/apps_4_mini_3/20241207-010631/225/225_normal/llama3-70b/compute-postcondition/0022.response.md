To analyze the impact of the code on the variables:

1. We have `i` which is 2.
2. We have `last_vowel` which is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel or not.
3. We do not have the initial value of `max_jump`, but the operation will update it based on the maximum of its current value and the computed expression.

Now, let's calculate the value of the expression:
- The expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` evaluates to `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

If `last_vowel` is 1 (the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel), the calculation will be:
- `(2 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

If `last_vowel` is 0 (the character at index 1 of `s` is not a vowel), the calculation will be:
- `(2 - 0) // 2 + 1 = 2 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

Therefore, depending on the value of `last_vowel`, `max_jump` will be updated with either:
- `max(max_jump, 1)` if `last_vowel` is 1,
- or `max(max_jump, 2)` if `last_vowel` is 0.

The value of `n` remains unchanged at least 2, and the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 1 if the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**.
