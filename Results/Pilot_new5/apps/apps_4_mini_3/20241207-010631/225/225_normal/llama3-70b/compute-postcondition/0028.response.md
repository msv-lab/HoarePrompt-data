The variable `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Since `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, we know that the expression `(n - last_vowel)` is positive, making `max_jump` potentially increase depending on its previous value. The overall state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `((n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, if any, and it will remain -1 if there are no vowels, with the current value of `last_vowel` not equal to `n - 1.**
