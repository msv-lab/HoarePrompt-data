According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is non-empty (greater than 0).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The variable `last_vowel` remains at 0, which indicates that at least one vowel has been encountered, and `max_jump` will still be at least 1 due to the conditions given.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need:
- `i` incremented to 1
- `last_vowel` remains at 0
- `n` remains as the length of the string `s`, which is still greater than `i`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0**
