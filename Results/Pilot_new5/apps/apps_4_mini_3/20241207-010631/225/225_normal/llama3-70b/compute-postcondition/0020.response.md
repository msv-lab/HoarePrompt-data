According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length `n` of the string `s`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of the non-empty string `s`, which is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be at least 2 to allow the loop to run with the new value of `i`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 1 if the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel**.
