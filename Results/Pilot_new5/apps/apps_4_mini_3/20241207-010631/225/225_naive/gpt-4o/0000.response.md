To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it satisfies the requirements specified.

### Problem Description Recap:
The Grasshopper can only jump on vowels and must calculate the minimum jump ability required to travel from the start of the string to the end. The jump ability is defined as the maximum distance between consecutive vowels (including the start and end of the string).

### Provided Program:
```python
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
```

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. The program initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1.
2. It iterates over the string, checking each character to see if it is a vowel.
3. Whenever a vowel is found, it calculates the distance from the last vowel's position (`prev_pos`) to the current position (`i`).
4. It updates `max_jump` to the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance calculated.
5. After the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel's position to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` again if necessary.
6. Finally, it returns the maximum jump required.

### Potential Case:
Letâ€™s consider the edge case where the input string consists of non-vowel characters only, such as:
- Input: `BCDFGH`

In this case, there are no vowels in the string. The program will:
- Start with `prev_pos` as -1.
- Iterate through the entire string, and since there are no vowels, the `max_jump` will never be updated from its initial value of 1.
- After the loop, it calculates the distance from `prev_pos` (-1) to the end of the string (6), which will update `max_jump` to 7.

However, according to the problem description, since there are no vowels to jump on, the Grasshopper cannot make any valid jumps, and thus the expected jump ability should logically be `len(s) + 1` (to reach the end) or possibly indicate that it cannot jump at all.

The output of the program will be 7, which is incorrect in the context of needing to jump only on vowels.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where there are no vowels correctly, as it implies a jump ability of 7 instead of indicating that jumping on vowels is impossible.
