According to the loop statement, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must remain less than `i`, which is still 4. Therefore, after this iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is updated correctly.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 2**
