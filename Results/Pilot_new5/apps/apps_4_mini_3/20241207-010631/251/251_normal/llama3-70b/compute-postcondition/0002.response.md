According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The variable `cakes` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop itself; however, it may be relevant within the loop body.

At the start of the first iteration, there is no indexing or specific value related to each iteration since the loop uses a placeholder (`_`). Therefore, there are no specific states to adjust for the loop execution apart from confirming the value of `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000)**
