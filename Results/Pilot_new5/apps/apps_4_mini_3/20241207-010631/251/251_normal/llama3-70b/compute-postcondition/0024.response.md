According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j`, which is determined by the range of `i`. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop for `j` will run for the values 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. This means that the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`, which is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is satisfied since `j` must be less than `i`, which is 2.

Thus, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented, and we maintain the other states as they are.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and the sum of `cakes[0][0]` and `cakes[2][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.**
