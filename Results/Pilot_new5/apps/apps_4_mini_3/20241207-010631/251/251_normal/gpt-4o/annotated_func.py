#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r, h) representing the radius and height of each cake, with 1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10,000.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples representing dimensions of `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` holds the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked with the cake at index `i`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked, as represented by the maximum value in the list 'dp'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of a cake. It computes the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked, ensuring that a cake can only be placed on top of another if its volume is greater than the one below it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and a list of tuples `cakes` where each tuple contains two integers indicating the radius and height of each cake. It processes input to gather these values and calls another function `func_1` with them, printing the result formatted to six decimal places. However, it lacks error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or wrong list lengths, which may lead to runtime errors.
