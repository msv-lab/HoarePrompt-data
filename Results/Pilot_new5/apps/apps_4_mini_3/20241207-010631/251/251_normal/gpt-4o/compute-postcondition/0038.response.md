The variable `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value or the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The preconditions state that `i` is greater than 3, which implies that `dp[i]` has been initialized and has a value, and `j` is fixed at 3. Given that `volumes` contains at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `volumes[i]` is accessible. 

After executing the line of code, the only variable affected is `dp[i]`, which is updated. The values of `n`, `i`, `cakes`, `volumes`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state reflects the new value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `j` is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to be max(`dp[i]`, `dp[3]` + `volumes[i]`).**
