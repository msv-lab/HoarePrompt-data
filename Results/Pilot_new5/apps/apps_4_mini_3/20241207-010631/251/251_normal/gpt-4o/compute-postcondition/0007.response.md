Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
