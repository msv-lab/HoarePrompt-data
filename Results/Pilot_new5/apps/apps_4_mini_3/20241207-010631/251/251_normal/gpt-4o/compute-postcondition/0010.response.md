Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`, and if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + volumes[i]`.***
