Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its old value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `dp[i]` remain unchanged.***
