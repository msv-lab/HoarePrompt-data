According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 2, meaning it has a value of at least 3. At this point, `j` would have been incremented from 0 to `i - 1`. So, if the loop is to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it equal to `i`, which will cause the loop to terminate.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `i`. Since `j` would have reached `i - 1` at the end of the last iteration, it will be necessary for `j` to be 3 to allow for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, and `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `j` is 3**
