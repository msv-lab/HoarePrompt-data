Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, and `x` is 1. If (n - x * a) % b == 0, the program completes execution without returning a value. Otherwise, the program also completes execution without returning a value, as there is no else part specified.***
