The code simply prints 'YES' to the output. No variables are modified or affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains all the original variable definitions without any changes. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b.**
