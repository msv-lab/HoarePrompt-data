The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, and `a` and `b` remain as integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10,000,000.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000**.
