The program does not find any non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. Therefore, the program reaches the line `print('NO')` and outputs this message. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the output indicates that the required condition was not met.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000; print 'NO'**
