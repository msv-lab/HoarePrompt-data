The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the current values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

From the initial state:
- `x` is calculated as `n // a + 1`
- `y` is calculated as `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`

After executing the `print` statement, the values of `x` and `y` will be output but will not change any variables or their states. Therefore, the output state keeps the original values of the variables but indicates that `x` and `y` are computed as described.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a + 1`, `y` is `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`, printed values of `x` and `y`.**
