Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. It checks if it is possible to express `n` as a non-negative linear combination of `a` and `b` by finding non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no combination satisfies the equation after iterating through possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'. If valid combinations are not possible (like when `a` and `b` are larger than `n`), the function may end up printing 'NO' without producing any meaningful output.**
