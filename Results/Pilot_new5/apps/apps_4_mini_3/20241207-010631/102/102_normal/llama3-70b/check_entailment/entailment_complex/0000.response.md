Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements as specified in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b`, from the input. This matches the problem description where these values represent the amount of money Vasya has and the costs of the items.

2. **Finding Non-negative Integers `x` and `y`**: The program iterates over possible values of `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) ranging from `0` to `n // a`. For each value of `x`, it calculates `y` (the number of Bars bars) based on the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola, specifically using the formula `y = (n - x * a) // b`. This calculation ensures that `y` is non-negative and that Vasya's total spending matches exactly `n`.

3. **Checking the Condition**: Inside the loop, it checks if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If this condition is satisfied, it outputs "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. This directly aligns with the requirements of the problem which state that Vasya should find two non-negative integers such that their respective costs sum to exactly `n`.

4. **Handling the "NO" Case**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination of `x` and `y`, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles on the items. This behavior correctly follows the problem description's requirement to indicate the impossibility of making the exact expenditure.

5. **Efficiency**: The loop iterates up to `n // a + 1` times, which is computationally efficient given the constraints (with `n` handling values up to 10,000,000).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine whether Vasya can buy the two items using exactly his available funds and provides appropriate outputs based on the findings, fulfilling the problem description's requirements. 

Since the program handles all cases as stipulated in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
