The code simply prints 'YES' to the output. None of the variables have been modified by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a + 1`, `y` is `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`**
