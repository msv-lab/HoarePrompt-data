Functionality: ** The function accepts two 2D lists (or tuples), `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. It swaps the position of 'X' between the two puzzles and returns True if both puzzles contain the same characters, regardless of the order. However, if either puzzle does not contain 'X', it will result in a NameError due to the undefined `x1` or `x2` variable. Therefore, the function does not handle cases where 'X' is missing from either puzzle correctly, potentially leading to runtime errors. **
