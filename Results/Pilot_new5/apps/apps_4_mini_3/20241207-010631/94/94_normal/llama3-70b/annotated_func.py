#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are 2D lists (or tuples) representing 2 Ã— 2 grids, where each grid contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X' (the empty cell).
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2` after all iterations of the loop have completed. If either 'X' is not present in the respective lists, the corresponding index will remain undefined.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True since both 'puzzle1' and 'puzzle2' contain the same characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', therefore sorted(puzzle1) is equal to sorted(puzzle2).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2D lists (or tuples), `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. It swaps the position of 'X' between the two puzzles and returns True if both puzzles contain the same characters, regardless of the order. However, if either puzzle does not contain 'X', it will result in a NameError due to the undefined `x1` or `x2` variable. Therefore, the function does not handle cases where 'X' is missing from either puzzle correctly, potentially leading to runtime errors.
