Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it fails:

1. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1()` attempts to swap the position of the empty cell ('X') between the two puzzles. However, this is unnecessary for determining if both puzzles can reach the same configuration through a series of valid moves. The state of the puzzles should be determined based on the current configuration and reachability, rather than swapping positions.

2. **Return Condition**: The function sorts both puzzles and compares them to check if they are equal. This approach does not take into account the valid sequence of moves that can be performed to reach a specific configuration. The sorting operation would return `True` for any two configurations that contain the same tiles regardless of their positions, which contradicts the problem's requirement to check if it is possible to reach the same configuration through valid moves.

3. **Handling of 'X'**: The logic assumes that both puzzles will always contain 'X', but if for some reason 'X' were not found (e.g., due to a bug), it would lead to a `NameError` when trying to access an undefined variable. This indicates a lack of robustness in the program.

4. **Validation**: The program does not perform any validation of the sequence of moves needed to transform one configuration into the other, which is critical for determining if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration.

In summary, the program fails to implement the core requirement of the problem description, which is to determine if a sequence of moves can lead to the same configuration. Instead, it incorrectly relies on comparing character sets after sorting, which does not reflect the actual movements possible in a sliding puzzle. Thus, the program is incorrect.
