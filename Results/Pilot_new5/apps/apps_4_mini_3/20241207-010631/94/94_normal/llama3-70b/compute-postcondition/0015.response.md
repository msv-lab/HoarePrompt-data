The variable `x2` is assigned the value of `i`, but the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `x2` remains unchanged otherwise, we cannot specify its new value based on the given information. The states of `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, and `x1` are still valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is 4; `x2` remains unchanged; `i` is undefined.**
