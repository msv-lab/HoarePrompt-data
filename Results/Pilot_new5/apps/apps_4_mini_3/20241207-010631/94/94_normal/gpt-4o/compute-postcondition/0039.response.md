Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space, and `queue` contains the strings that represent those unique states. If no moves were possible, `visited` remains as just `start`, and `queue` stays empty.**
