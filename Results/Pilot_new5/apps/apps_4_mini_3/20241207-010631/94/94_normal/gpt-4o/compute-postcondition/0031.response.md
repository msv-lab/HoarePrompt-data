The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Given that `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is also between 0 and 1 (inclusive), the possible values for `new_row * 2` are 0 (when `new_row` is 0`) or 2 (when `new_row` is 1). The possible values for `new_col` are 0 (when `new_col` is 0`) or 1 (when `new_col` is 1`). Therefore, `new_pos` can take on the following values based on all combinations of `new_row` and `new_col`:

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0`
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`

Thus, the variable `new_pos` can hold values of 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the possible combinations of `new_row` and `new_col`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive); `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive); `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
