Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` remains unchanged. If `new_row` is between 0 and 1 and `new_col` is between 0 and 1, `new_state_str` is formed by swapping the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, it is added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.***
