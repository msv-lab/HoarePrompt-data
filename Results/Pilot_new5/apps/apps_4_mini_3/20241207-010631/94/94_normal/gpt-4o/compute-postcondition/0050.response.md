The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `new_state` converted into a string by joining its elements together. The previous state included `start` as a string of length 4, `visited` containing all unique permutations of `start`, `queue` being non-empty, `current` as the first element from `queue`, `empty_pos` as the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` as `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` as `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` as `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` as `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` as `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The state of `new_state` is also valid after execution.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_state_str` is now a string representation of `new_state`, but we do not have the specific values or structure of `new_state` provided.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is not empty; `new_state` is the list resulting from swapping its elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from the joining of the elements of `new_state`.**
