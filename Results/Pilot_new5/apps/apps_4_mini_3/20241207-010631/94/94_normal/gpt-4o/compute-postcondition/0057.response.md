The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` assigns new values to the variables `new_row` and `new_col`. Specifically, `new_row` becomes the sum of `empty_row` and `dr`, and `new_col` becomes the sum of `empty_col` and `dc`. 

Given the information:
- `empty_row` is calculated as `empty_pos // 2`
- `empty_col` is calculated as `empty_pos % 2`
- `dr` and `dc` are changes to the row and column positions, respectively.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str`; `current` is assigned to the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` has at least one direction left; `new_state` is the list resulting from swapping its elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from the joining of the elements of `new_state` if the indices for the new position are valid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2).**
