The code assigns the index of the character 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. Given the initial state, `current` is a specific permutation of the string `start`, which is composed of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. Therefore, `empty_pos` will be an integer representing the index of 'X' within that permutation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
