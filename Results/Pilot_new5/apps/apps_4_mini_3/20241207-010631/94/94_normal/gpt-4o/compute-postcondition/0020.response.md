In the provided code, `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned the values of `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The specific values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not given, but we know that `new_row` and `new_col` can take values between 0 and 1 (inclusive). 

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are being updated based on the specified expressions, we can conclude that their values will now depend on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, and `directions`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `visited` includes both `start` and 'ABCX', `directions` must have more pairs of values to continue iteration**.
