The operation swaps the characters at the positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The exact values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos` depend on the current state of the game represented by `current`, as well as the specific values of `dr` and `dc` (which are not provided). 

Since `current` is the first state in `queue`, and `empty_pos` is determined by the index of 'X' in `current`, we can assume that the swap will alter the contents of `new_state`. `new_state` initially contains the characters of `current`, and the swap changes the characters at the specified positions.

The output state should reflect that the contents of `new_state` have changed due to the swap, while retaining all other details about the variables that remain unchanged.

Since the exact character values before and after the swap are not specified, I will represent the values generically.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` contains at least 1 state; `current` is a state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `directions` must not be empty; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list containing the characters of `current` with the characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
