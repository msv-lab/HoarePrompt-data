The code snippet assigns values to `empty_row` and `empty_col` by performing integer division and the modulo operation on `empty_pos`. The variable `empty_pos` holds the index of 'X' in the `current` string (which is the first element removed from `queue`). The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` will be determined based on the value of `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` contains all new valid states formed during the loop execution; `current` is the first element removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.**
