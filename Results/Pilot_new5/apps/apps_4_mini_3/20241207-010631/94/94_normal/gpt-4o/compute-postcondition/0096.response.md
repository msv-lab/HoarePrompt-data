The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the iterable `current`. This means that `new_state` will be a list containing the elements of `current`, but the specific values of `current` are not given, so its contents remain unknown. The other variables are not impacted by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list created from `current`.**
