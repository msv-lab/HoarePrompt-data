The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which converts the string `current` into a list. Since `current` is equal to `start`, which is a string of length 4, `new_state` will be a list containing the characters of `start`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`; `directions` is not empty; `new_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state` is a list of characters from `start`.**
