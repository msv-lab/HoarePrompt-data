The code snippet `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the `queue` list. The other variables, including `start`, `new_state`, and `visited`, remain unchanged, aside from the fact that `new_state_str` is now a part of the `visited` list.

Since `new_state_str` is already included in `visited`, we can assume the output will reflect this addition.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is a list of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining those characters; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`.**
