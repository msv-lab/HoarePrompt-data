Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the valid range, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`, and `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`.***
