Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'). If `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), `new_state` is a list containing the characters of `start` in some order, `new_state_str` is formed by joining those characters, and if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`.***
