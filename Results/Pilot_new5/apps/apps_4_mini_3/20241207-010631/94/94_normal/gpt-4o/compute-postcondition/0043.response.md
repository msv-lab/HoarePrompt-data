The `divmod` function takes two arguments and returns a tuple consisting of the quotient and the remainder when performing integer division. In this case, `empty_pos` is an index of 'X' in `current`, which is presumably a value between 0 and 3 for a string of length 4.

The outputs of `divmod(empty_pos, 2)` are:
- `empty_row`, which is the quotient (the row index), calculated as `empty_pos // 2`
- `empty_col`, which is the remainder (the column index), calculated as `empty_pos % 2`

The initial state does not alter any other variables, and we only update `empty_row` and `empty_col` based on the value of `empty_pos`.

Thus, the output state will include the previous conditions with updated values for `empty_row` and `empty_col` based on `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is empty_pos // 2; `empty_col` is empty_pos % 2.**
