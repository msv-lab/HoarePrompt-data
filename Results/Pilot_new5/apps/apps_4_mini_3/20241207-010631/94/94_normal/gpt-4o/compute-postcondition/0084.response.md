The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value calculated from `new_row` and `new_col`, which are derived from the current position of the empty space. Given that `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, the value of `new_pos` will be `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Since `new_row` and `new_col` are both confirmed to be within the range of 0 to 1 inclusive, `new_pos` will take on a valid value based on their calculations.

The output state will reflect the new calculated value of `new_pos`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` must contain at least 1 state; `current` is the first element removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `directions` must not be empty; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
