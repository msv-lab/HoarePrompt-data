Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the new position is valid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), then `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not previously present, and `queue` includes `new_state_str` alongside its prior elements. The `current` remains the first element from `queue`, while `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, with `new_state_str` being the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`. If the position is not valid, no changes occur.***
