The variable `directions` is assigned a list of tuples representing movements in a grid: up, down, left, and right. This assignment does not change the values of `start`, `queue`, or `visited`. Therefore, the output state retains the previous values of these variables while adding a new list.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
