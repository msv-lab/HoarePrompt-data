The `visited` set adds the `new_state_str` to it. The other variables' states remain unchanged. The values of `start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are still valid, and the state of the `visited` set is updated with the addition of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is between 0 and 1; `new_col` is between 0 and 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
