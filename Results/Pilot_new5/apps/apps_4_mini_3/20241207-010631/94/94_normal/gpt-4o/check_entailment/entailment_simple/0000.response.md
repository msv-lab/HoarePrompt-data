Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bessie and Elsie can reach the same configuration of their puzzles. 

Here's why it does not meet the problem description:

1. **Reachable States Logic**: The variable `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable` are both assigned the output of `func_2()`, which returns a set of all unique configurations that can be reached from the initial state of the puzzles. However, the line `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` is intended to check if there is any common configuration between the two sets. The use of the bitwise AND operator `&` is incorrect in this context. It should be using the intersection operator or method (`bessie_reachable.intersection(elsie_reachable)`) to properly check for common configurations.

2. **Output Statements**: The program is supposed to output "YES" if there is a common configuration and "NO" if there is not. Given the way the intersection is checked currently, the program might not function as intended.

3. **Input Handling and Validation**: The program is expected to take input in a specific format (two lines for each puzzle), and while the input is read correctly, there is no validation to ensure that the input strictly adheres to the constraints outlined in the problem. 

4. **Program Logic**: The logic in `func_2()` correctly explores the neighboring configurations of the empty cell, but without a proper check mechanism for the intersection of reachable configurations, it fails to produce the correct result based on the problem requirements.

In conclusion, the incorrect use of operators for checking if configurations from both puzzles can intersect leads to incorrect outputs, thus failing the problem's requirements.
