The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value that results from joining the characters of `new_state`, which consists of the characters that have been swapped at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The exact content of `new_state_str` depends on the current values of `new_state`. The variables `visited` and `queue` remain unchanged in this context because the code does not modify them. 

Thus, the output state only updates `new_state_str`. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `new_state_str` is the result of joining the characters of `new_state`.**
