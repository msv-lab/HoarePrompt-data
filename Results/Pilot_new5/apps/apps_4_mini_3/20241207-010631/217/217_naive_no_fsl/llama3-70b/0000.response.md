Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) as described in the problem. The issue arises from the way it partitions the sequence into two parts \( b \) and \( c \). 

To illustrate this, consider the following input example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, we can partition this sequence into two sequences in various ways. The optimal partition for maximizing \( B - C \) would be to choose \( b = \{1, 1, 1, 1\} \) and \( c = \{\} \) (an empty sequence), which gives us \( B = 4 \) and \( C = 0 \), resulting in \( B - C = 4 \).

However, the provided program will handle the input as follows:
1. It sorts the list (which is already sorted in this case).
2. It then alternates the sums between \( b \) and \( c \), resulting in:
   - \( b = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( c = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - Thus, \( B - C = 2 - 2 = 0 \).

This does not yield the correct maximum value of \( B - C \) for the given input. 

The logic used to sort and alternate indices for \( b \) and \( c \) does not cover all possible combinations and thus cannot guarantee the maximum difference as required by the problem statement. 

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
