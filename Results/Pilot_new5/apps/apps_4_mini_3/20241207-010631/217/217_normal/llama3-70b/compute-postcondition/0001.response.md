The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers created by taking input and mapping it to integers. The input is a space-separated string that will be processed into a list of integers. The variable `n` indicates that there are `n` integers in the list `a`, which means the length of `a` will be equal to `n`. The values of the integers in `a` will be between -100 and 100, as per the initial state.

The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input, with the specific condition that the length of `a` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 (derived from input).**
