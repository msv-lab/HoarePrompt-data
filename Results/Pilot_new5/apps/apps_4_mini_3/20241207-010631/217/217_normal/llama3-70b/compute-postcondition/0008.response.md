The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is an odd integer, it takes a value from the list `a` at an odd index. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, and since `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 100, `i` will always reference a valid index within the bounds of the list `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `b` is 0; `i` is an integer such that `i % 2 != 0 (i is odd); `c` is the updated value equal to its previous value plus `a[i]`.**
