Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100. If `i` is even, then `b` is set to `a[i]`, `c` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `i` is odd, then `b` is 0, `c` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its previous value, and `i` is an odd integer.***
