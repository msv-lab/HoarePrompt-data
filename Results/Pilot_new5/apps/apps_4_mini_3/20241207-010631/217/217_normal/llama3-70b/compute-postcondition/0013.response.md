Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order; if `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` may be updated, and `i` remains an even integer. If `i` is odd, `b` is set to 0 and `c` is updated to `c + a[i]` with `i` being an odd integer.***
