The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The specific output of the function is not provided, so we will base our description solely on the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, which must be between 1 and 100, and a list `a` of `n` integers, each of which must be between -100 and 100.**
