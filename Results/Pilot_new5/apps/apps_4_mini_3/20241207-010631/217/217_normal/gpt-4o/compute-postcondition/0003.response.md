The code calculates the sum of all negative integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `C`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`. The value of `C` will depend on the specific values of the integers in the list `a`. 

Since no specific values for `a` are provided, we can only describe the state of `C` based on the conditions given:

- `C` will be the sum of all integers `x` in `a` where `x < 0`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.**
