Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` has at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains the previous nodes plus `neighbor`, `count` remains 1, `node` is the same as the previous value, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` now includes `neighbor`.***
