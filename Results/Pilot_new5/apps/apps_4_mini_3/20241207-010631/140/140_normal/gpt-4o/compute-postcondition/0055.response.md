The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `queue` already contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`. The initial state indicates that `in_degree[neighbor]` was decremented by 1, and that `graph[node]` contains at least 2 neighbors. The value of `count` is now 3, and `node` has been defined as the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`. The states of other variables, such as `in_degree[neighbor]` and `count`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, `queue` now includes `neighbor`, `count` is now 3, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, and `graph[node]` contains at least 2 neighbors.**
