The variable `count` is initialized to 0. There are no other changes in the state as the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `count`.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`; `queue` contains all nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`; `count` is 0**
