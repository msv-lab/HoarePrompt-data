According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph`. The loop iterates over the keys of the `graph` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `graph` must contain at least one entry (i.e., at least one vertex). 

Given that `n` is the number of vertices, the keys of the `graph` should range from 1 to `n`. If `graph` is properly constructed according to the problem statement, it should contain keys that correspond to the vertices from 1 to `n`.

At the start of the loop, the variable `u` should be set to the first key of the `graph`. Since we are not altering the original state of `in_degree`, it remains a dictionary with all values as 0.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, `u` is the first key in the graph (which is 1 if graph is not empty)**
