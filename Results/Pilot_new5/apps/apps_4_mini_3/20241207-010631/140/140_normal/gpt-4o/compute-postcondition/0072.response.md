The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` still includes at least one neighbor of `node`, meaning that `queue` is not empty and will have `neighbor` added to it. The values of `in_degree[neighbor]`, `count`, and `node` remain unchanged since the code only modifies the `queue`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the updated state of `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1 for all neighbors of `node`, `queue` now includes `neighbor` as well as at least one other neighbor of `node`, `count` remains the same, and `node` is the next value obtained from `queue.popleft()`.**
