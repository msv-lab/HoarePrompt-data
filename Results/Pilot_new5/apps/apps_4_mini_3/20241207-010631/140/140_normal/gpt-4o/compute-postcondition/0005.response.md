The variable `in_degree[v]` is updated by incrementing its value by 1. The value of `v` is determined as the second element in the iterable of `graph[1]`. Since `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `v` will be a valid key in `in_degree`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, `u` is 1, `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, where `v` is the second element in the iterable of `graph[1]**
