You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) contains integers representing directed edges such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)

    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'

The graph represented by `edges` contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):

    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that there is likely a condition in the graph or edges that does not permit a certain operation or that a cycle has been detected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of vertices), an integer `m` (the number of directed edges), and a list of `edges` representing directed edges in a graph. It checks if the directed graph contains cycles. If the graph is acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected upon removing any edge from the graph, it also returns 'YES', indicating that the graph remains acyclic without that edge. If no such condition is met, it returns 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle or a failure to meet the conditions set by the edges. The function does not handle cases where the input values for `n` and `m` are outside the specified constraints.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500).

            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` is equal to the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n`, and all values are integers representing the number of directed edges for each vertex; `u` is each vertex from 1 to `n`.

            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is equal to the total number of vertices in the graph that have been processed (i.e., those with their `in_degree` reduced to 0), `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` that were reachable from the initial vertices with `in_degree[v] == 0` is now 0, while those that were not reachable retain their original `in_degree` values. If `count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph, then the graph has no cycles; otherwise, there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if count is not equal to n, indicating there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle; otherwise, it returns False, indicating the graph has no cycles.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph with integer keys (vertices) and lists of integers (edges). It calculates whether there are cycles in the graph by checking if all vertices can be processed based on their incoming edges. The function returns True if there are cycles in the graph (i.e., some vertices cannot be processed), and False if there are no cycles present. This implementation assumes that the graph contains vertices numbered from 1 to n, where n is an integer between 2 and 500.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
