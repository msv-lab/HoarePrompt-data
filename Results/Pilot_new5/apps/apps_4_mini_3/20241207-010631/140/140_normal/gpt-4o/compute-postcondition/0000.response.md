The code initializes the `in_degree` dictionary, where each key is an integer from 1 to `n`, and each corresponding value is set to 0. The `graph` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Given that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, the `in_degree` dictionary will now hold `n` keys (from 1 to `n` inclusive) with all values initialized to 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` representing vertices and values are lists of integers representing directed edges; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and all values are 0.**
