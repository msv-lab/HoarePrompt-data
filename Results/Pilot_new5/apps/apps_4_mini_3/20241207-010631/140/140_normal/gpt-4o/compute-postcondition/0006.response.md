According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `graph[u]`. If `graph[u]` has at least 2 elements, the loop can iterate for each element in the iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 1, and `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements. If the current iteration processed the second element of `graph[1]`, then for the loop to execute again, `graph[1]` must have at least 3 elements.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `u` remains 1, and `v` should refer to the third element in `graph[1]`. Additionally, since `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1 for the second element, we must ensure there is still a valid second element in the iterable.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, `u` is 1, `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, where `v` is the third element in the iterable of `graph[1]**
