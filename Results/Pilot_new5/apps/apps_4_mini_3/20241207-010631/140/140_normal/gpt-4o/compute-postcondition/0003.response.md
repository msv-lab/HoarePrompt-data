The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. Since `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n and `u` is set to 1, we know that `v` must be a valid key in `in_degree` and that it corresponds to a key in `graph`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `in_degree[v]` by 1, while maintaining the conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, `u` is 1, `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
