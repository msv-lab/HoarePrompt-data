The `node` variable is assigned the value obtained by removing and returning the leftmost element from the `queue`. The initial state specifies that the `queue` contains all nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`. After executing the code, `queue` will have one less node, and `node` will represent the removed node.

Since `queue` initially contains nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`, this will still hold true for the remaining nodes after one node is popped from the queue.

The `count` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains all remaining nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is 0, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`**.
