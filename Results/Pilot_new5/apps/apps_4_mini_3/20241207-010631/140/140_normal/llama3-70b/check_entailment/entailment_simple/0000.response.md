The given program is designed to check if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the implementation has a fundamental flaw in its approach.

### Explanation of the Program's Logic

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is built using adjacency lists, which is correct.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The program employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with a recursion stack to detect cycles in the graph.
3. **Output Logic**: If a cycle is detected, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

### Problem with the Program

The main issue arises in the output logic. The problem description specifies that it should only print "YES" if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. The current program only checks if there is a cycle present and does not account for the possibility of removing one edge to eliminate that cycle. 

### Counterexample

Consider the graph with the following edges that form a cycle:
- Vertices: 3
- Edges: 3
- Edges list: (1 → 2), (2 → 3), (3 → 1)

In this case, the graph is cyclic, and removing any one of these edges (e.g., (3 → 1)) would make the graph acyclic. However, the program will output "NO" because it only checks if a cycle exists, rather than if the graph can be made acyclic by removing one edge.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not correctly determine if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
