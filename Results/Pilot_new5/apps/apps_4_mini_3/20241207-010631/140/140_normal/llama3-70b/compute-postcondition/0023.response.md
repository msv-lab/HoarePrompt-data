Postcondition: ***`node` is the current vertex in the graph, which has at least one unvisited neighbor remaining. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that there is at least one unvisited neighbor for the vertex `node`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that the current vertex `node` has an unvisited neighbor in the recursion stack. Otherwise, there is no explicit action taken.***
