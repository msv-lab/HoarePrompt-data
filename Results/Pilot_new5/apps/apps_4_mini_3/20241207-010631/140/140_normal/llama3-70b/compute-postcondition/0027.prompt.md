You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists representing the directed edges of the graph, visited is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack. The number of vertices n is between 2 and 500, and the number of edges m is between 1 and min(n(n - 1), 100000). Each vertex is represented by integers from 1 to n.
```
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the function `func_1` has confirmed the neighbor has been visited and is part of a valid path in the graph.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating that all neighbors of the current vertex 'node' have been visited and are present in the recursion stack.

Case_3: The program returns True, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor in graph[node]

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex in the graph.

Case_5: The program returns True indicating there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex 'node' in the graph.

Case_6: The program returns True indicating that the current vertex 'node' has at least one unvisited neighbor remaining in 'graph[node]'

Case_7: The program returns False indicating that the current vertex 'node' is not part of a cycle in the graph.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
