Postcondition: ***`node` is the current vertex, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor remaining, and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in the list. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex in the graph.***
