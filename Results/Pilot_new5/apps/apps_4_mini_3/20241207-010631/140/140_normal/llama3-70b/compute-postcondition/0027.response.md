The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 
- `node`, which is an integer representing the current vertex.
- `graph`, which is a list of lists representing the directed edges of the graph.
- `visited`, which is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex has been visited.
- `rec_stack`, which is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack.

After executing the function body, the function can return the following:
- Case_1: Returns `True`, indicating that the function `func_1` has confirmed the neighbor has been visited and is part of a valid path in the graph.
- Case_2: Returns `True`, indicating that all neighbors of the current vertex `node` have been visited and are present in the recursion stack.
- Case_3: Returns `True`, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`.
- Case_4: Returns `True`, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex in the graph.
- Case_5: Returns `True`, indicating there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex `node` in the graph.
- Case_6: Returns `True`, indicating that the current vertex `node` has at least one unvisited neighbor remaining in `graph[node]`.
- Case_7: Returns `False`, indicating that the current vertex `node` is not part of a cycle in the graph.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a list `graph`, a list `visited`, and a list `rec_stack`, and return `True` or `False` based on the visitation status and relationship of the vertex with respect to cycles in the graph. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, returning True in cases indicating visited neighbors, remaining unvisited neighbors, and paths in the graph, or returning False if the current vertex is not part of a cycle.**
