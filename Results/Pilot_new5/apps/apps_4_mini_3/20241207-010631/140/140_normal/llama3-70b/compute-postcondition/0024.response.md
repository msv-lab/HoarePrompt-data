Output State: **`node` is the current vertex after exploring all its neighbors, `graph[node]` represents a list of all neighbors for `node`, `visited` indicates whether each vertex has been visited, `rec_stack` indicates whether each vertex was part of the recursion stack during the exploration. If the loop executed all possible iterations, all reachable vertices from `node` have been marked as visited. If any neighbor was found in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle in the graph. If there were no neighbors, `graph[node]` is empty.**
