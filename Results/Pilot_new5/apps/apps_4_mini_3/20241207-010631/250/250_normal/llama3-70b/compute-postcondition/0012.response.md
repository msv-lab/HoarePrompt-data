The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True**.
