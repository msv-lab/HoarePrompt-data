Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, and `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, including the new value `i + j`, where `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`.***
