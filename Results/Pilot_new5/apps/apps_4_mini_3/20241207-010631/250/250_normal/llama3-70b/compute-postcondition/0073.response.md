According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` already has at least one element, and `j` takes the first element of `additional_marks`.

For the loop to execute again, there needs to be at least one more element in `additional_marks` for the next iteration. Since `j` is currently the first element, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, the index of `j` must move to 1, and `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements.**
