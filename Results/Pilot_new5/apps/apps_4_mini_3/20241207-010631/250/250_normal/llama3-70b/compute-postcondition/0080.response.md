According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `marks` list. The loop iterates over each element in `marks`, which means that if `marks` contains more than one element, it can execute for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `marks`. 

If `marks` has at least two elements, the next iteration will use the second element of `marks` as `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `marks` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be set to the second element of `marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` retains its original state**
