According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. If `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, the loop can run again for the next element in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and we have the constraints that `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` not already present in `marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure there is at least one more element in `additional_marks`. If `j` is currently pointing to the next element, we can increment `j` to the next element in the `additional_marks`. Hence, we need to establish that there must be at least one more element after the current one.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks after the current one`**
