Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`, then `need_x` is set to True and `need_y` is also set to True. Otherwise, there are no changes to `need_x` and `need_y`.***
