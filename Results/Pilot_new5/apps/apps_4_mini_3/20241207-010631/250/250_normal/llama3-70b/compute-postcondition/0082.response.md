Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a non-empty iterable. The current value of `i` added to `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not present in the `marks` list.***
