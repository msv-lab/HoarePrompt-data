Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains all unique elements formed by `i + j` for each `i` in `marks` and each `j` in the original `additional_marks`, ensuring that each sum does not exceed `l` and is not already in `marks`. If no new sums were added, `additional_marks` retains its original state.**
