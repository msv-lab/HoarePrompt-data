The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. The values of `i` and `j` are the first and next elements of the `marks` list, respectively. The last element of `additional_marks` will now be updated to the result of `i + j`. The previous conditions about `n`, `marks`, and the structure of `additional_marks` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the next element of `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements with the last element being equal to `i + j`, and `additional_marks` now has an additional element which is `i + j` appended.**
