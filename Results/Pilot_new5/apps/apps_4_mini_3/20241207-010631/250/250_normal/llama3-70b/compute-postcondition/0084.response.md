Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a non-empty iterable. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not present in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains `i + j`.***
