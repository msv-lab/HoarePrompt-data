The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`, and if that difference was previously equal to `x`, then `need_x` is set to True; `need_y` is True.
