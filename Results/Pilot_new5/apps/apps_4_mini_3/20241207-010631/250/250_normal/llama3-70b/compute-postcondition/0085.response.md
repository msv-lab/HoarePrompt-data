According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `additional_marks` iterable. If `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `additional_marks` now contains `i + j` where `j` is the current element from `additional_marks`. 

Since `additional_marks` must have at least one more value for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next value of `j` is available. As `j` iterates through `additional_marks`, the next value would be the one after the last processed value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**.
