According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the value of `i`. The loop starts executing from `i` and continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop will execute at least once because `j` will start from 1 and will go up to `n - 1`.

At the beginning of the loop:
- `j` will be equal to `i` (which is 1) on the first iteration.
- We need to ensure that `marks` has enough elements to match the range from `i` to `n - 1`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly, we need to confirm that `marks` is an array or list with at least `n` elements. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `marks` must be an array with at least `n` elements**.
