According to the code, the loop iterates over `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more element in `additional_marks` that has not yet been processed in the previous iterations. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element of `marks`. `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements, and the second element in `additional_marks` is `j`. The value `i + j` must be calculated for the next iteration. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`, then it can be processed. 

Assuming the loop has not yet processed all elements in `additional_marks`, we now need to adjust the index `j` to reflect the next element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, if `j` is currently the last processed element, we need to increment it to the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` that has not yet been processed, `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.**
