According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` variable. The loop will execute if `additional_marks` is a non-empty iterable. Since `n` is a positive integer and `marks` has at least 2 elements, we know that `i` (which is the second element of `marks`) does not directly influence the execution of the loop. Therefore, the requirements for the loop to execute are that `additional_marks` must be a non-empty list or iterable.

The current state does not specify any conditions about `additional_marks`, so we need to ensure that it is defined and contains at least one element for the loop to run. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must be a non-empty iterable**
