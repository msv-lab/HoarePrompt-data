Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` (the number of marks), a positive integer `l` (the maximum distance), and two positive integers `x` and `y` (specific distances). It reads a list of `n` unique integers representing the positions of marks. The function checks whether there exist pairs of marks that have distances equal to `x` and `y`. If not, it includes `x` and/or `y` in a list of additional marks. Then, it attempts to generate new marks by adding each existing mark to the values in the additional marks list, ensuring the results do not exceed `l` and are not already present. Finally, the function prints the count of additional marks and the values themselves. Notably, if no new marks can be generated, `additional_marks` may only contain `x` and `y`.**
