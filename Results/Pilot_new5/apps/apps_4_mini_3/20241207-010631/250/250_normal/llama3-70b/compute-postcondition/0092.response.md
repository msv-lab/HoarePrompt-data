According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements of the `marks` list. The loop iterates over each element in `marks`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `marks`. Since `marks` contains at least 2 elements, the next element to be processed in the loop will be the third element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are at least 3 elements in `marks` (which is already satisfied as it contains at least 2 elements), and `i` would then be updated to the third element of `marks`. 

Therefore, the next state will reflect that `i` has moved to the third element of `marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` remains unchanged**.
