Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the next element of `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements with the last element being equal to `i + j`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.***
