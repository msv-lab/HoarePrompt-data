According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i` and goes up to `n-1`. Given that `i` is 0, `j` is currently 0, and `n` is a positive integer within the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), we need to check the condition for the loop to run another time.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 1. The loop can only execute again if `j` (which will be 1) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can indeed execute one more time.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, we should have:
- `j` is now 1,
- and `n` must remain greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
