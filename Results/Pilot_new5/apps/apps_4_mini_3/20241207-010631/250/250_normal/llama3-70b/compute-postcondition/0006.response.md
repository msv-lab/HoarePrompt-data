The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition involving `marks[j]` and `marks[i]`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and `need_x` is True.**
