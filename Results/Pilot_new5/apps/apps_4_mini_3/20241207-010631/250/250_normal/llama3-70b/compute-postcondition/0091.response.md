Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` is a list containing elements that are the sums of `i` and elements from the original `additional_marks`, provided that each sum does not exceed `l` and is not already present in `marks`. If no elements can be added, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its original state.**
