The code prints the length of the `additional_marks` list. Since the initial state defines that `additional_marks` contains unique elements formed by the sums of `i` in `marks` and `j` in the original `additional_marks`, if no new sums are added, the length of `additional_marks` remains the same as before execution. 

Let's denote the current length of `additional_marks` before the code is executed as `m`. The code outputs this length.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` is a list of unique elements with length equal to `m`, and `len(additional_marks)` is printed as `m`.**
