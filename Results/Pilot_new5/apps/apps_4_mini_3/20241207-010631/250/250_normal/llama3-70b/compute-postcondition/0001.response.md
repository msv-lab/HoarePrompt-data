The variable `marks` is assigned the value of a set created from the integers provided by the input. The `input().split()` method will result in a list of string representations of integers, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`, and then stored as a set to ensure all values are unique. The initial state of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remains unchanged. The output reflects that `marks` now holds a set of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` is a set of integers from input.**
