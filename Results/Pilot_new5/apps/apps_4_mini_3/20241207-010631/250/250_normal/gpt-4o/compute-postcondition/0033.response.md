The variable `new_marks` is initialized as an empty set. The other variables, including `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `a`, `x_found`, and `y_found`, are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_marks` is now an empty set while preserving the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False; `new_marks` is an empty set.**
