Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `x_found` is False; and `y_found` is False. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. If `x_found` is True, no changes are made to `new_marks`.***
