The code `result.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `result`. The initial state indicates that `y` is a positive integer, and `result` contains the value of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` is empty; `result` contains the value of `x` and `y` has been added to it; the current value of `x_found` is set to False.
