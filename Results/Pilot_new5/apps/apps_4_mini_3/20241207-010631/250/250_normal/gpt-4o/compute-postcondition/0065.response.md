The line of code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the `new_marks` set. Since `new_marks` is being updated directly due to this line, we need to include this change in the output state. 

The conditions regarding `y_found` and checks against `marks_set` do not affect the execution of this specific line of code, as it is executed unconditionally. Thus, we assume that the initial state of `new_marks` remains unchanged in terms of previous conditions.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; if `y_found` is False, then conditions regarding `marks_set` apply; `new_marks` now contains `mark + x`.**
