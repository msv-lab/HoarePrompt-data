The code `marks_set = set(marks)` converts the list `marks` into a set, which means that `marks_set` will contain all unique elements from `marks`. Since `marks` is a list of `n` integers representing the distances of the marks from the origin, `marks_set` will be a set containing those distances without any duplicates.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains all of their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, and `a` remains a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l.**
