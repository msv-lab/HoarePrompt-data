The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. Given that `new_marks` is either empty or does not include `mark + x`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y`, and that `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is now present in `marks_set`, we can conclude the following:

1. `new_marks` will now include the value `mark - y`.
2. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Since `new_marks` is modified with the addition of `mark - y`, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `y_found` is still False, `new_marks` now includes `mark - y`, and the expressions `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, and `mark - y + x` do not exist in `marks_set`.**
