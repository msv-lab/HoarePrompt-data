Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, if either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `(mark - x + y in marks_set)` or `(mark - x - y in marks_set)` holds true, `new_marks` will include `mark - x`. If neither condition is satisfied, `new_marks` remains an empty set.***
