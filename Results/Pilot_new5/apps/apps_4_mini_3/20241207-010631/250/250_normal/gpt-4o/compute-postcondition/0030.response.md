Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `x_found` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`; `y_found` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`***
