The function accepts four integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list `marks` of `n` integers. It checks if there are any marks that can reach either `x` or `y` distances from another mark. If both distances can be reached, it prints `0`. If either distance cannot be reached, it attempts to generate new marks based on the existing ones and prints a new valid mark if available, or returns the values `x` and `y` if no new marks can be created. The function handles the scenario of not finding any valid marks by outputting `x` and `y` when necessary.
