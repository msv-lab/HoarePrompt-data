Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 2 elements. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is set to True.***
