To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's review the requirements and how the program implements them.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. The ruler has `n` marks at specific distances.
2. The program needs to determine if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using existing marks.
3. If they cannot be measured, the program must output the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y`.
4. The output should provide the distances where these new marks should be placed.

### Program Analysis
- The program begins by reading the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with the list of existing marks.
- It checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks by checking the differences between marks to see if they match `x` or `y`.
- If both distances can be measured, the program prints `0`.
- If not, it attempts to determine what new marks can be added such that both `x` and `y` can be measured:
  - It uses a set to quickly search for the necessary conditions to measure `x` and `y`.
  - It considers various combinations of existing marks and the distances `x` and `y` to determine if additional marks can satisfy the requirement.
- Finally, if not already found, it includes the distances `x` and `y` in the result if they still cannot be measured.

### Correctness Check
1. **Finding Distances**: The program correctly checks whether both distances `x` and `y` can be achieved using existing marks. This is crucial according to the problem description.
2. **Minimum Additional Marks**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of extra marks required. If both distances cannot be measured initially, it adds conditions to correctly derive if adding one or two marks can solve the problem.
3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the correct number of additional marks and their respective distances as required.

### Potential Cases
- In scenarios where `x` and `y` can be measured with the existing marks, the program will correctly output `0`.
- If only one of the distances can be measured, the program will find the appropriate additional mark to add.
- If neither can be measured, both distances will be added as necessary.

### Conclusion
The program fulfills all conditions set out in the problem description and handles various scenarios appropriately. 

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program can be stated as:

Correctness: **True**
