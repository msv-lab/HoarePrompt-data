The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`: a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), representing the number of distances.
- `l`: a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), representing the total length.
- `x`: a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), representing a distance mark.
- `y`: a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), representing another distance mark.
- `a`: a strictly increasing list of `n` integers, representing the distances of the marks from the origin, where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`.

The function's output is determined by evaluating the distances in `a` against the values `x` and `y`. The function does not specify a return type in the initial description; however, it is implied that it will return a specific result based on the evaluation of the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, l, x, y, and a, and returns a specific result based on the evaluation of distances in the list a against the values x and y.**
