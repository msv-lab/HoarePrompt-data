Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged as no else part is provided.***
