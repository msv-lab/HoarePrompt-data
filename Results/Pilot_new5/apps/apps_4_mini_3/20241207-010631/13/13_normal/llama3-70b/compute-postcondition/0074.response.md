According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop starts iterating from `i + 2`, which means it starts from 3 since `i` is 1. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `j` (which is 3) must be less than `n`. Since `n` is given to be at least 2 and can go up to 100000, the critical condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least 4 (because `j` starts at 3).

Thus, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4, and `j` will start at 3 during the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`**
