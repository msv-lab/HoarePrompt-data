According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n - 1` times, which means that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `n` meets the requirement for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` must be initialized to 0, as that is the starting point for the loop index. The loop will then increment `i` on each iteration until it reaches `n - 2`.

Therefore, to summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0**
