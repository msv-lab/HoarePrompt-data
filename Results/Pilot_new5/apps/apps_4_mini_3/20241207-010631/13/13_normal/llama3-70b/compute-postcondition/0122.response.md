To analyze the final state after the loop executes, we need to consider how the loop incrementally processes the string `s` starting from index `i + 2` and checks for consecutive 'G' characters.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000
- `i` is 2
- `j` starts from `i + 2` (which is 4)
- `beauty` is initialized to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of the substring `s[0:i]`, with a minimum value of 1 if there are no 'G' characters.

The loop continues as long as `s[j]` is 'G'. Each iteration of the loop increases `beauty` by 1 for each 'G' encountered. When an index `j` points to a character in `s` that is not 'G', the loop breaks.

1. If there are additional 'G' characters consecutive to the substring `s[0:i]`, `beauty` will increase accordingly.
2. If there are no 'G' characters starting from `j = i + 2`, the loop will exit immediately, and `beauty` will remain as initially calculated based on `s[0:i]`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop, regardless of how many times it executed, must reflect the state of `beauty` and the final value of `j` after the loop concludes. 

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is the first index after the last 'G' encountered or `n`, `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[i + 2]` plus the initial `beauty` value based on `s[0:i]`.**
