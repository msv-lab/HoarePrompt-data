Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is 'G', the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `s[i - 1]` must exist, and `beauty` is updated to 2 if the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'. If `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
