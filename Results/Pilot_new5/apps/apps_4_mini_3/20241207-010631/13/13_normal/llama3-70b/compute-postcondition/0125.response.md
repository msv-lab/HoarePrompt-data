According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 2`, which means it can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently 2, after the increment, `i` will become 3. The loop can continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 3 (because at `i` = 3, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4). 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3**
