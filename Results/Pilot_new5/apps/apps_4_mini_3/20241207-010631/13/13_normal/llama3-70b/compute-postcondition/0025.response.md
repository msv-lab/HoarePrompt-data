The line of code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` assigns `max_beauty` the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `left` is less than `right`, which is true in this case since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1. Therefore, `curr_beauty` gets increased by 1. 

So, if we denote the previous value of `curr_beauty` as `prev_curr_beauty`, the new value of `curr_beauty` after incrementing will be `prev_curr_beauty + 1`. The new value of `max_beauty` will depend on whether `max_beauty` was already greater than `prev_curr_beauty + 1` or not.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1.**
