According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop can execute one more time for `j` being -1, but since the loop condition checks for `j` in the range from `i - 1` to -1, it will not execute again. Since `j` is currently at 0, in the next iteration, `j` will be decremented to -1, which is outside the range.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must adjust `j` to -1 based on the loop decrementing after the last iteration. The condition on `beauty` does not affect the range of the loop execution since it only dictates the behavior inside the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, and `beauty` can be either 2 or 3 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`.**
