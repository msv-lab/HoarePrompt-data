According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i + 2` up to (but not including) `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4. 

To check if the loop can execute one more time, we need to determine the next value of `j`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 2` equals 3, and the loop starts from 3. The next value of `j` would be 5, which means for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**
