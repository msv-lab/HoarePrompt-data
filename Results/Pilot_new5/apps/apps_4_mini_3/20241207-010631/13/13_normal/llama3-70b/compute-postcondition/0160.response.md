Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable by swapping one 'G' with one adjacent 'S' in `s`; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; if there are no such pairs where `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0; the result of `print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))` is the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`.**
