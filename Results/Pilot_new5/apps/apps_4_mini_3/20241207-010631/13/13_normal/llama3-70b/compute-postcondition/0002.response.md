The variable `golden` is assigned a list of indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`. Given that `s` consists only of the characters 'G' and 'S', the values of `golden` will be a list of integers representing the positions of 'G' within the string.

The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer in the range from 2 to 100000, and `s` is a string of length `n`. The output state will reflect the new variable `golden`, which is a list of indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`.**
