Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of the substring `s[0:i]` plus 1. Otherwise, `beauty` remains equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of the substring `s[0:i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
