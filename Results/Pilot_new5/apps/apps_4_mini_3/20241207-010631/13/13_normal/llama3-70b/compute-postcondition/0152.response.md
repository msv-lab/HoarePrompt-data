According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. In the previous iteration, `j` is 6 and `n` is greater than 6. Since the loop starts with `j` being `i + 2` (which is 5), the next value of `j` will be `7` after incrementing it. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `7`. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 7**
