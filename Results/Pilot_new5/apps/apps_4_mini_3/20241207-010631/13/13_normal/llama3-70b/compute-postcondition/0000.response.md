`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input integer that satisfies the condition `2 <= n <= 100000`. The initial state of the string consisting of 'G' and 'S' is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and the second input is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', with `n` being the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and the second input is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'**.
