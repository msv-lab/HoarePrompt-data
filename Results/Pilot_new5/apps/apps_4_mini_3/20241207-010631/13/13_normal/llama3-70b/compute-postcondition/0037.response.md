Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', and `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` and is less than `right`, which is greater than 1, and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, where `curr_beauty` is now 1.***
