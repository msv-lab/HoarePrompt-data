Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`. If the character at `s[3]` is 'G', then `beauty` increases by 1. Otherwise, the character at `s[3]` is not 'G', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
