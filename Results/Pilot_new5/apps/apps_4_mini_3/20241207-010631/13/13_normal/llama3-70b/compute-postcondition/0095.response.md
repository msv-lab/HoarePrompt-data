`beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was 1, so after the operation, `beauty` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `beauty` is 2, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `beauty` is 2, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'**.
