The variable `max_beauty` is assigned the value `0`, which is its initial value. The states of the other variables, `n`, `s`, and `golden`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, and `max_beauty` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0**.
