The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of determining the maximum length of consecutive 'G' trophies that can be achieved by making at most one swap between a 'G' and an 'S'. Let's analyze the program based on the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Identifying Current Maximum Beauty**: 
   - The program first calculates `max_beauty`, which represents the maximum length of consecutive 'G's currently in the string. This part of the program iterates through the string and counts consecutive 'G's, resetting the count when 'S' is encountered.

2. **Calculating Potential Maximum Beauty with One Swap**:
   - The program then checks for potential swaps by looking for locations where a 'G' is immediately followed by an 'S'. For each such case, it calculates the beauty if the 'G' were to be swapped with the 'S' (i.e., counting how many 'G's would be connected if the 'S' were turned into a 'G'). This involves checking both sides of the 'S' to count contiguous 'G's.

3. **Final Output**:
   - It then prints the maximum of the two values: the original `max_beauty` and the `max_beauty_one_swap`.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum length of golden trophies without any swaps.
- It adequately identifies where a swap could potentially increase the length of golden trophies and calculates the new length correctly based on surrounding 'G's.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when there are no 'G's or when all are 'G's, as it appropriately handles the counting logic and outputs the correct maximum length.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- If there are no 'G's, the output will be `0`, which is correct as per the third example in the problem description.
- If all trophies are 'G's, the output will be equal to `n`, correctly reflecting the maximum possible length.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description correctly and implements the requirements as specified. 

Correctness: **True**
