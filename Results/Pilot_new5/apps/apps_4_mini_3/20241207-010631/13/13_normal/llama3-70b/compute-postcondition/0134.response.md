`beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` can be either 1 or 2, so after the increment, it will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables (`n` and `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `beauty` is either 2 or 3, `j` is `i - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `beauty` is either 2 or 3, `j` is `i - 2**
