The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is 'G', the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1, `s[i - 1]` must exist, and `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
