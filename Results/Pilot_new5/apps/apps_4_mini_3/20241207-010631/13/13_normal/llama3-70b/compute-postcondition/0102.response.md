Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` can be either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `beauty` remains 1 or is updated to 2 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
