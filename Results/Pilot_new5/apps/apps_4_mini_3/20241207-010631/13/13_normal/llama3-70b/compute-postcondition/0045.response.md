The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is 2, so after the execution, `left` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged, as their states are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `right` is 2**
