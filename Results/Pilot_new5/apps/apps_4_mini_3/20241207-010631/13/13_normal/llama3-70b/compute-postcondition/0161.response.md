The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, it processes the input string `s` and produces an output. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.**
