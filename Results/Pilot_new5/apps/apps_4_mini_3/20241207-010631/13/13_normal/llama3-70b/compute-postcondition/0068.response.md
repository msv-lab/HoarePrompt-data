Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` equals 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `beauty` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `s[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
