According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `j` is within the range specified by `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. In this case, `i` is 3, so the range will be `range(2, -1, -1)`, which means `j` will take the values 2, 1, and 0 during the iterations.

Since the loop iteration starts from `i - 1` (which is 2) and decrements down to -1 (not inclusive), all necessary conditions for `j` are met at the start of the loop execution.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `n`, `beauty`, or `i` as they do not affect the execution of this specific loop. The only relevant variable is `j`, which will start from the value of 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `beauty` is 1, `j` is 2**
