Output State: **`i` is equal to the first index that does not contain 'G' in `trophies`, `n` must be greater than `i`, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` as previously stated, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`. If all values from the initial `i` to the last index less than `n` in `trophies` are 'G', then `i` will equal `n`.**
