Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of all consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. Since `segments` is empty, it indicates that there are no 'G' characters in `trophies`. The original value of `n` remains in the range 2 to 100000, and `trophies` remains unchanged.***
