Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`. If the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `curr_end - curr_start + 1`, `prev_end - prev_start + 1`, and an additional 1. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
