Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`. If the character at position `i` in `trophies` is 'G', then `segments` contains the tuple (0, i - 1), `i` represents the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the start of `trophies`, and if `i` equals `n`, all characters in `trophies` are 'G'. Otherwise, `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the character at position `i` in `trophies` is 'S'.***
