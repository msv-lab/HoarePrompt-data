Postcondition: ***If all values from index `i` to the last index less than `n` in `trophies` are 'G', then `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, and `segments` includes the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` remains as previously stated, and `trophies[i + 1]` is not equal to 'G'.***
