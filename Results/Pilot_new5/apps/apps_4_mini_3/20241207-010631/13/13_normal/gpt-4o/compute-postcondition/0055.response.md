Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `segments` has at least 2 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[0][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[0][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[1][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[1][1]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of `max_length` and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.***
