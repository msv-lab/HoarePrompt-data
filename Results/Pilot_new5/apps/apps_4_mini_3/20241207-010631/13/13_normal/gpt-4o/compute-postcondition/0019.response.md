The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is such that trophies[1] must be 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is such that trophies[1] must be 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 1**
