Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the string contains only lowercase letters. Specifically, if the string consists entirely of lowercase letters without any uppercase letters, the program will not properly count them as a "pretty set" since it only updates `max_count` when it encounters an uppercase letter. 

For example, given the input:
```
5
abcde
```
The expected output should be `5` since there are 5 distinct lowercase letters. However, the program would return `0` because it does not encounter any uppercase letters to trigger the count update. 

Thus, the logic fails for strings composed entirely of lowercase letters, leading to incorrect results.
