Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not satisfy the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

1. **Distinct Lowercase Letters**: The program collects the indices of all lowercase letters in the string but does not ensure that these letters are distinct. The problem requires that the letters at the selected positions must be distinct.

2. **Uppercase Letters Separation**: The program does not consider the condition that there should not be any uppercase letters between the positions in the pretty set. The program simply counts all lowercase letters without checking for uppercase letters that might separate them.

3. **Expected Output**: The function aims to print the count of lowercase letters, which may not correlate to the maximum number of distinct positions that can form a "pretty" set according to the specified conditions.

For example, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the program would count 6 lowercase letters, but the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in valid positions is 2 (positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8).

Thus, the program does not perform the required checks and calculations to meet the problem description's criteria.
