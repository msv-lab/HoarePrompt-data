The code creates a list comprehension that iterates through the string `s`, checking each character to see if it is a lowercase letter. The indices of the lowercase letters are then collected into a list called `lowercase`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string of length `n`, which is a positive integer. The final state will include the new variable `lowercase`, which will contain the indices of all lowercase letters in `s`.

Since `s` is a string of length `n` (which is known), and `lowercase` will be determined based on the contents of `s`, we can't specify the exact values in `lowercase` without the actual string but can indicate their nature.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to the value of `n`; `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase letters in `s`.**
