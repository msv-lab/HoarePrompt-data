The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the first character of `s` and is a lowercase letter, `current_set` includes `char`, and `current_count` is increased by 1.
