`current_count` is assigned the value `0`, but it was already initialized to `0` in its declaration. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string `s`; `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set; `current_count` is 0.
