The `print(max_count)` statement outputs the value of `max_count`, but it does not modify any variables or change the state. The value of `max_count` remains as it was before the print statement. 

Therefore, the output state will retain all valid information from the initial state, including the unmodified variable `max_count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is unchanged, `current_set` is empty if the last character of `s` is uppercase or contains unique lowercase letters from the last contiguous segment, `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters from the last contiguous segment which could be 0 if the last character is uppercase.**
