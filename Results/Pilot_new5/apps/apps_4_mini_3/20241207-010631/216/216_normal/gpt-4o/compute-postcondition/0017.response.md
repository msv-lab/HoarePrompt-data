The operation `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. The other variables `current_set`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged in the absence of specific initial values. 

Since `char` is the second character of `s`, and `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, adding `char` to `current_set` modifies `current_set` by including `char`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` now includes `char`, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` remains unchanged**.
