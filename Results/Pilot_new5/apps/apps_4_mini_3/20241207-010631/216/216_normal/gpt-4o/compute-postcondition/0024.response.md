According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the second character of `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next character in the string. 

Given that the string `s` has a length of `n` and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), if the last processed `char` is the second character, then the next character will be the third character in the string. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `char` must now be the third character of `s`
- The string `s` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`**
