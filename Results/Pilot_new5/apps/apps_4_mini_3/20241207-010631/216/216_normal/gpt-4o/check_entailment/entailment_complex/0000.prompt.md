You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string s, and s is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters encountered in contiguous segments of `s`, `current_set` is empty if the last character of `s` is uppercase or contains unique lowercase letters from the last contiguous segment, `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters from the last contiguous segment, which could be 0 if the last character is uppercase.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in contiguous segments of the string, resetting the count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered, and prints this maximum count. If the string consists entirely of uppercase letters or contains no lowercase letters, the function will return 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
