According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), it indicates that `s` has a length of at least 1. Therefore, `s` cannot be an empty string if `n` is positive.

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be considered are:
- `n` is already a positive integer.
- `s` must be a string of length `n`, which is at least 1.
- `char` will be the first character of `s` in the first iteration.

Since `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length n, `char` is the first character of s**
