Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, `l` is between 1 and `r`, and `r` is between `l` and `n`. If `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, the function proceeds with this condition. Otherwise, if `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is determined based on the conditions where if `l` equals 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r` equals `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r` is less than `n`, it calculates `move_to_l` as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which is then printed.***
