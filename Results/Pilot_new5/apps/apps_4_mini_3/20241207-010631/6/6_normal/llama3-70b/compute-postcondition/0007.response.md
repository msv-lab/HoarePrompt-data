Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is a positive integer. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `pos - r`.***
