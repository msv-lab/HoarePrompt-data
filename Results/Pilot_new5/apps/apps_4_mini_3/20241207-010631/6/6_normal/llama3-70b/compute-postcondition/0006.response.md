The variable `ans` is updated by adding `pos - r` to its previous value. Since it is given that `pos` is greater than `r`, the result of `pos - r` will be positive. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is a positive integer equal to the previous value of `ans` plus `pos - r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is a positive integer equal to the previous value of `ans` plus `pos - r`.**
