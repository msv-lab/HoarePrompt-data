The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The parameter `n` is an integer that ranges from 1 to 100, `pos` is an integer that ranges from 1 to `n`, `l` is an integer that ranges from 1 to `n`, and `r` is an integer that ranges from `l` to `n` such that 1 ≤ n, 1 ≤ pos, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. 

The function does not specify its return values in the provided output, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the input parameters. Therefore, we do not have enough information to describe the functionality of the function with respect to its output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer between 1 and 100), pos (integer between 1 and n), l (integer between 1 and n), and r (integer between l and n) but does not specify its return value.**
