To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the annotated code and see if it meets all the requirements.

The problem requires us to compute:
1. The maximum number of questions any pupil is asked.
2. The minimum number of questions any pupil is asked.
3. The number of times Sergei is asked.

**Key points to consider from the problem description:**
- The teacher asks pupils in a zig-zag manner, starting from the first row to the last row and then back to the first.
- Each pupil is asked questions based on the total number of questions (k).
- The number of rows (n) and the number of pupils per row (m) are provided.
- The constraints allow for a maximum of 10^18 questions, which requires careful handling of large numbers.

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. **Calculating `max_asked`:**
   - The line `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` computes the maximum number of questions asked to any pupil. The logic here is that each full cycle of asking (down and up) involves `2 * n` pupils. The formula computes how many full cycles fit into `k` questions and then accounts for any extra questions that might be distributed across the pupils.
   - This computation correctly captures the maximum since the pupils are asked in a round-robin fashion.

2. **Calculating `min_asked`:**
   - The line `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` ensures that the minimum count is at least 1, which is correct because every pupil will be asked at least once if any questions are asked at all. The adjustment for `(n - 1)` correctly accounts for how the pupils might be asked less frequently in the zig-zag pattern.

3. **Calculating `sergei_asked`:**
   - The line `sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` captures how many times Sergei is asked. The first part calculates how many complete cycles Sergei is part of, and the second part checks if he is asked again based on the remaining questions in the current cycle.
   - This approach correctly accounts for Sergei's position and the zig-zag asking pattern.

**Edge Cases:**
- The only edge case mentioned is the potential issue of `y` exceeding `m`. However, the problem constraints specify `1 ≤ y ≤ m`, and thus this scenario cannot occur based on the inputs as given.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as specified in the problem description. It calculates the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's question count correctly, adhering to the specified asking pattern and constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
