The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This indicates a change in direction, but it does not affect any other variables directly. The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `col`, `remaining_questions`, `max_questions`, and `row` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 2, `row` is increased by `direction`, and `direction` is -1.**
