The value of `row` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `row` is unknown but it will definitely increase by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `row`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 2.**
