Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 2` and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` equals -1, then `row` is increased by 3.***
