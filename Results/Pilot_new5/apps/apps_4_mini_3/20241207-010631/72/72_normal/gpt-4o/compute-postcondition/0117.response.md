Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m - 1`, `row` oscillates between 0 and `n-1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations, `direction` is either 1 or -1 based on the final oscillation direction, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` reflects the net result of increments and decrements during the loop. If the loop does not execute, `col` remains 0, and `max_questions` retains its original value, while `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
