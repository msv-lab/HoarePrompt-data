The code calculates the `full_cycle_length` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value of `(2 * n - 2) * m`. If `n` is equal to 1, it is assigned the value of `m`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `m` is also an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the resulting value of `full_cycle_length` will depend on whether `n` is greater than 1 or equal to 1.

The conditions are as follows:
- If `n > 1`, then `full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m`.
- If `n = 1`, then `full_cycle_length = m`.

The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n = 1`.**
