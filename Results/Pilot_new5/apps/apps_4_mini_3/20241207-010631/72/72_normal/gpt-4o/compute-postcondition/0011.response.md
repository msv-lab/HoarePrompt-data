Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`. If `n` > 1, then `full_cycle_length` is equal to (2 * n - 2) * m, `full_cycles` is equal to k // ((2 * n - 2) * m), `remaining_questions` is equal to k % ((2 * n - 2) * m), `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to (`full_cycles` + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2). If `n` is equal to 1, no changes occur in the state of `min_questions` and `max_questions`.***
