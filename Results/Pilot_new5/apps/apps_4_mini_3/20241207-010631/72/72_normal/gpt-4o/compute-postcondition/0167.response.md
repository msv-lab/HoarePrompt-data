Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` oscillates between 0 and `n-1` based on the direction of movement, `col` is equal to `m - 1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations, `direction` is either 1 or -1 depending on the final oscillation, `remaining_questions` is less than or equal to 0, and `max_questions` reflects the net result of increments and decrements throughout the loop execution. If the loop did not execute, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` remains unchanged, and `row` stays at its initial value.**
