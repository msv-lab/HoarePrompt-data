Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 0, `row` oscillates between 0 and `n-1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations and has been incremented by 1, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` reflects the net result of increments and decrements during the loop. If `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `row` and `col` are equal to `x` and `y`, respectively, and `sergei_questions` has been incremented by 1. The current value of `direction` is 1.***
