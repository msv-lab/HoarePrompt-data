The code assigns `-1` to the variable `direction`. Since `direction` is being assigned a specific value, it does not affect the other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 101 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, and `direction` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 101 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, and `direction` is -1.**
