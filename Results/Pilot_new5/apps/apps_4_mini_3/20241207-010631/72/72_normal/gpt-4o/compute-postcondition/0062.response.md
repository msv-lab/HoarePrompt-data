The value of `max_questions` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the other variables, while `max_questions` is now one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
