The variable `row` is incremented by 2. Given that the current value of `row` is equal to `x + 1`, after the increment, the new value of `row` will be `(x + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` is equal to `x + 3`, and the previous value of `row` was `x + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` is equal to `x + 3`**.
