To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the implementation and the provided problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The teacher asks pupils in a specific order based on their seating arrangement (row-wise, and then reversing the order after reaching the last row).
2. The function needs to compute:
   - The maximum number of questions any pupil is asked.
   - The minimum number of questions any pupil is asked.
   - The number of questions asked specifically to Sergei, who sits at position `(x, y)`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program first initializes variables based on the input and computes the full cycle length and the number of full cycles that fit within `k` questions. It accounts for the total number of questions that can be evenly distributed among the pupils.
- It handles the special case where `n = 1` separately, ensuring that when there is only one row, all questions are asked to that row's pupils.
- It calculates `min_questions` and `max_questions` based on full cycles and adjusts for the number of remaining questions.
- A loop iterates over the remaining questions, updating the count of questions asked to Sergei and adjusting the maximum number of questions based on the direction of asking rows.
- Finally, it prints the results.

### Correctness Check:
- The program adheres to the order specified in the problem: it first asks all pupils in the first row, then continues to the next rows, reverses direction upon reaching the end, and continues asking in the correct order.
- The calculation of `sergei_questions` is done by checking if the current position matches Sergei's position and counts accordingly.
- The `max_questions` and `min_questions` are computed correctly based on the number of full cycles and remaining questions.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases like:
  - Only one row (`n = 1`), wherein all questions are directed to that single row.
  - Large values of `k` up to `10^18`, allowing for precise calculations of cycles and distributions.
  
### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to meet the problem description and handles all specified requirements, including edge cases.

Therefore, the final correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
