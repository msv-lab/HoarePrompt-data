The variable `direction` is assigned the value -1, but it already holds that value. Therefore, there is no change in the value of `direction`, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1, and `row` is decreased by 1.**
