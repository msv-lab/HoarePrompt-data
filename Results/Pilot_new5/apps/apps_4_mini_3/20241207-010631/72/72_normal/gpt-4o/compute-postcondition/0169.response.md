The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `y` is an integer between 1 and `m` inclusive.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:

- Case_1: If `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the function returns a specific value (not detailed in the prompt).
- Case_2: If `k` is less than or equal to `n + m`, the function returns another specific value (not detailed in the prompt).
- Case_3: If `k` is greater than `n + m`, the function returns yet another specific value (not detailed in the prompt).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, and return different values based on the conditions involving these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, and returns different values based on specific conditions regarding the values of these parameters.**
