Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is `m - 1`, `row` is oscillated between 0 and `n - 1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations, `direction` is either 1 or -1 based on the final oscillation direction, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` reflects the net result of increments and decrements during the loop. If the loop does not execute (if `m` is 0), then `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` remains unchanged, and `row` stays at its initial value.**
