The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `direction` was `-1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 1, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been decremented by 1, and `row` is decreased by 1.
