The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. The previous value of `row` was `row - 1`, so the new value of `row` will be `(row - 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `row - 3`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `row`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is equal to `row - 3`.**
