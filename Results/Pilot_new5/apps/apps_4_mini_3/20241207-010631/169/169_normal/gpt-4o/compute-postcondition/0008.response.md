The code updates the value of `stones` using the expression `max(0, stones - 1)`. Given that `stones` is initially 0, the calculation will result in a maximum of 0 and -1, which will therefore set `stones` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a non-empty input string; `stones` is 0; `operation` is the first character in `s`, `operation` is not equal to '+', and `operation` is equal to '-'**
