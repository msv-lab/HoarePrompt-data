According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. The variable `operation` takes on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `operation` is the first character in `s`, and we need to determine what happens for the next iteration.

Since `s` is a non-empty input string, after processing the first character, the next character to be processed would be the second character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in `s`, and `stones` remains 1 or 0 based on the operation of the second character.**
