`stones` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `stones` is 0, so after the operation, `stones` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string, `stones` is now 1, and the current value of `operation` is still the first character of `s`, which is '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string, `stones` is now 1, and the current value of `operation` is '+'**.
