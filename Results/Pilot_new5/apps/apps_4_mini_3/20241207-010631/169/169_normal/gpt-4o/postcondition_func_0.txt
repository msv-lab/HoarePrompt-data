The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the symbols '+' and '-'. It calculates the net result of operations on a counter starting from 0, incrementing the counter by 1 for each '+' and decrementing it by 1 for each '-' without allowing the counter to go below 0. Finally, it prints the resulting number of stones after all operations have been applied.
