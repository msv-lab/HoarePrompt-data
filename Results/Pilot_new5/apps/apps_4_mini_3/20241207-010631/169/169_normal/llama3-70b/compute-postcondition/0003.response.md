The variable `plus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('+')`, which counts the number of '+' characters in the string `s`. The variable `s` consists of characters '+' and '-', and its length is `n`. The variable `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`, which can be derived as `n - plus_count` since the total length of `s` is `n` and it only contains '+' and '-'.

The values of `n`, `s`, and `minus_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s'.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is equal to `s.count('+')`.**
