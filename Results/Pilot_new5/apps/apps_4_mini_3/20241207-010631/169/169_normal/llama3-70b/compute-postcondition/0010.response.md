Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. It counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. If the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters, which will be a non-negative integer. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
