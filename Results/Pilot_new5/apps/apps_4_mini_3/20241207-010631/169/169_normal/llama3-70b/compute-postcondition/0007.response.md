The expression `print(plus_count - minus_count)` calculates the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`. The initial state indicates that `plus_count` is equal to `s.count('+')`, while `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`. Since the count of '-' is less than or equal to the count of '+', the result of `plus_count - minus_count` will be a non-negative integer.

Thus, after executing the print statement, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is equal to `s.count('+')`; `plus_count - minus_count` is a non-negative integer.**
