The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with length `n` greater than 0; `ind` is `n + 1`; `i` is `n + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
