According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the string `s` (which is `n`). The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with length `n` (greater than 0), so the loop has executed for `i` values from 0 up to `n-1`. If `i` is currently at `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, which is not valid since `i` must be less than `n` to continue. 

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `n`, and since `s` remains unchanged, `ind` will also be preserved as it is not mentioned to change. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with length `n` greater than 0; `ind` is preserved; `i` is `n`**
