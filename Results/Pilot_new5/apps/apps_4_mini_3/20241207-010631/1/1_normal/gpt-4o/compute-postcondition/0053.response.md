`end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `bind - 1`, where `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`. Since `end_colon` is being updated to the current value of `i`, the original state of `end_colon` being -1 is no longer valid. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range, `end_colon` is `bind - 1`**
