Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is equal to `bind - 2`, and `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `end_colon` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
