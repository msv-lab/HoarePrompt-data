The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, and performs the following checks: it finds the index of the first '[' and the last ']', and verifies that the indexes indicate a valid structure. If valid, it locates the first ':' after the '[' and the last ':' before the ']', counting the number of '|' characters between them. The function returns the count of '|' characters plus 4. If any of the conditions for a valid structure are not met (e.g., no brackets or colons in the correct positions), it returns -1.
