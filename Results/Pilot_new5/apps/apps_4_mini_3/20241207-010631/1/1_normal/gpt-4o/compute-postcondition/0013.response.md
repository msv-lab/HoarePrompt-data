The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string with a length `n` greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `ind` will equal `n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with length `n` greater than 0; `ind` is `n + 1`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
