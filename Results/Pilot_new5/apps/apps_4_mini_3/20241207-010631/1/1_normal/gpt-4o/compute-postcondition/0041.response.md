According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `bind`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind + 1` is less than `bind`, and since `i` is currently set to `ind + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `ind + 2` at the start of the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `bind`, meaning `ind + 2` must be less than `bind`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `s` remains a string of length greater than 0.
- `ind` remains the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`.
- `bind` remains the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s'.
- `i` is now `ind + 2`.

State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `ind + 2` is less than `bind`, and `i` is `ind + 2`**
