The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `bind` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
