You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one `[` has been found, otherwise it is False; `ind` is the index of the first `:` found after a `[` if such a combination exists, otherwise it remains -1.
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one ']' has been encountered in `s` while scanning from the end; `bind` is the index of the last ':' found after the first ']', or -1 if no such ':' exists; `ind` remains -1 if no ':' is found after a '['.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        if (ind >= bind) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            ans = 4
            for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    ans += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True; `bind` is greater than `ind`; `ind` is not -1; `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters found between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`.
            print(ans)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one ']' has been encountered in `s` while scanning from the end; `bind` is the index of the last ':' found after the first ']', or -1 if no such ':' exists; `ind` is not -1, meaning at least one ':' is found after the last '['; and `bind` is not -1, indicating that at least one ':' has been found after the first ']'. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `f` is True, `bind` is greater than `ind`, `ind` is not -1, `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters found between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one ']' has been encountered in `s` while scanning from the end; `bind` is the index of the last ':' found after the first ']', or -1 if no such ':' exists; `ind` remains -1 if no ':' is found after a '['. If either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 is printed. If `ind` is less than `bind`, then `f` is True, `bind` is greater than `ind`, `ind` is not -1, `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters found between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. It searches for the first `:` after a `[` and the last `:` before a `]`. If either `:` is not found, or if the first `:` is not before the last `:`, it prints -1. If the conditions are met, it counts the number of `|` characters between the first `:` and the last `:` (exclusive) and adds 4 to this count before printing the result. If there are no `|` characters, it will print 4.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
