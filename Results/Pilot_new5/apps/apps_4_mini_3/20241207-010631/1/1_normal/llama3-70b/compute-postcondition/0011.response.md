The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the first character of `s` is not '['; the current character at index `i` of `s` is ':'; `f` is true; `ind` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
