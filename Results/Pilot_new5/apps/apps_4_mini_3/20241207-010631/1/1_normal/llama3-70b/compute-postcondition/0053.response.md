The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `bind` is equal to `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
