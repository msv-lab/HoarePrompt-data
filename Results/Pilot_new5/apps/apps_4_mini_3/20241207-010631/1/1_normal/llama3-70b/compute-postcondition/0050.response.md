According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, starting from `n - 1` and decreasing until it reaches `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3`. As `n` is greater than 1, after the decrement, `i` will still be valid for the next iteration as long as it is greater than or equal to 0.

The loop condition allows `i` to be `0` for the final iteration. Thus, for the next iteration, we require `i` to be `n - 3` and `s[i]` will correspond to the character at that index.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`**
