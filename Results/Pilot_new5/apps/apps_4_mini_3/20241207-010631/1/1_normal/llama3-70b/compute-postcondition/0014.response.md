Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is '[', then `f` is set to True. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not '[', and if `s[i]` is ':', then if `f` is true, `ind` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
