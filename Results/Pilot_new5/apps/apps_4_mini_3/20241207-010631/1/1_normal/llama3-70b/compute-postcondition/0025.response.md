The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `ind` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
