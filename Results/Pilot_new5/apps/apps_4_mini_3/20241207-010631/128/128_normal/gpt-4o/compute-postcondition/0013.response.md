The code `potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `potential_sales_increase` in descending order. The sorting operation affects only the `potential_sales_increase` variable, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `potential_sales_increase`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples, `regular_sales` contains `len(days)` elements, `total_sales` is the sum of elements in `regular_sales`, and `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in descending order.**
