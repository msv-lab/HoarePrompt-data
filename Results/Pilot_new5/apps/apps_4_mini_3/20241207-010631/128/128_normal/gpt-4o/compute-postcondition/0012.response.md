The `total_sales` variable is assigned the sum of all elements in the `regular_sales` list. The `regular_sales` list contains `len(days)` elements, each being `min(k_i, l_i)`. Thus, `total_sales` will be a non-negative integer, as `regular_sales` is derived from non-negative integers. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples, `regular_sales` contains `len(days)` elements, `total_sales` is the sum of elements in `regular_sales`.**
