The variable `total_sales` is increased by the sum of the first `f` elements from the list `potential_sales_increase`, which is sorted in descending order. Since `total_sales` was previously defined as the sum of the elements in `regular_sales`, the new value of `total_sales` will be the sum of `regular_sales` plus the sum of the top `f` potential sales increases. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples, `regular_sales` contains `len(days)` elements, `total_sales` is the sum of elements in `regular_sales` plus the sum of the first `f` elements from `potential_sales_increase`, and `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in descending order.**
