The code snippet initializes an empty list called `potential_sales_increase`. None of the other variables (`n`, `f`, `days`, `regular_sales`) are affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9), `regular_sales` is an empty list, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.**
