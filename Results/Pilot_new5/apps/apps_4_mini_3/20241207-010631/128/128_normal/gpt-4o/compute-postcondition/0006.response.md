The `regular_sales` list is updated by appending the value `min(k, l)`. The values of `k` and `l` are derived from the second tuple in the `days` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a non-empty list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `k` is the first element of the second tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the second tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` now includes `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, `regular_sales` includes `min(k, l)` appended.**
