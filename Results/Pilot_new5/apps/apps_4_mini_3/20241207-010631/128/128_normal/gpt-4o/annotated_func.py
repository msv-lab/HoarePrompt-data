#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for each of the n days.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples, `regular_sales` contains `len(days)` elements with each element being `min(k_i, l_i)`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `len(days)` elements with each element being `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of the elements in regular_sales plus the sum of the first f elements from potential_sales_increase.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing products and clients for each day. It calculates the total sales by summing the minimum of products and clients for each day (regular sales) and adds the highest possible increase in sales from the first `f` days of potential sales increases. The function returns the total sales, which includes both regular sales and selected potential increases. The function does not handle cases where `f` is larger than the number of days available, as it simply takes the top `f` increases without checking bounds.
