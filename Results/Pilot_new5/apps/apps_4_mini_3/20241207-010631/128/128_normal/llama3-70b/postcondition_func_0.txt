The function accepts input values for `n` and `f`, then reads `n` pairs of non-negative integers `(k_i, l_i)`. It calculates the total number `sold` based on specific rules: for the first `f` days, it takes the minimum of `k_i * 2` and `l_i`, and for the remaining days, it takes the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i`. Finally, it prints the total `sold`. The function does not handle invalid inputs nor does it return any value; it only prints the result.
