The `days` list is updated to include a tuple `(k, l)`, which means that a new entry is added to the list with the current values of `k` and `l`. The values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` now contains a tuple `(k, l)`; `k` is an input integer; `l` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` now contains a tuple `(k, l)`; `k` is an input integer; `l` is an input integer.**
