According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and `_` is a placeholder for each iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and `f` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to `n`. Since the loop executes for `_` from 0 up to `n-1`, we need to ensure that there is still one more iteration possible.

If the current iteration was the last one (i.e., `_` equals `n - 1`), then for the loop to execute one more time (which would not be possible since it has already completed its `n` iterations), we must now consider that `_` will be incremented for the next execution. Thus, for the loop to execute again, the value of `_` must be increased to `n`, which indicates that we have completed `n` iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`**
