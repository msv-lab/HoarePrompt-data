The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly but operates on the assumption of the following constraints: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), and for each day \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq n\)), \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). 

The functionality of the function is not defined in the provided output. Hence, I cannot provide specific return values or cases based on the incomplete output specification. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints of integers n, f, k_i, and l_i as specified. The return value and specific functionality are not provided.**
