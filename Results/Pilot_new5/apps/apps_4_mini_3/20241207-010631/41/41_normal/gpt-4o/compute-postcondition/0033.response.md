The code `break` does not modify any variable values but instead exits the most inner loop or if statement that it is part of. Since we do not have information about any loop or conditional structure surrounding this `break`, we will indicate that we have exited a structure.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
