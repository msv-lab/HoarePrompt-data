The code snippet `print('maybe')` outputs the string 'maybe' but does not change any variable values. The initial state remains valid as no variables have been affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False; and the output is 'maybe'.**
