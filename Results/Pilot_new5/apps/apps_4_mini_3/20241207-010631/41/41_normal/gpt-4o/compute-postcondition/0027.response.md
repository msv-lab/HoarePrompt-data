According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. Since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing, we conclude that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
