The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The initial condition regarding `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` may or may not hold true, but since we are not given any specific values for `ratings`, we cannot determine its impact. However, since `is_unrated` is now explicitly set to `True`, this will be reflected in the output state.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the new value of `is_unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, `is_unrated` is True**
