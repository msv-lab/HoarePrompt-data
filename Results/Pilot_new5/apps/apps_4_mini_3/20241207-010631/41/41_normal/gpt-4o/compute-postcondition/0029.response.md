The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply exits the nearest loop or conditional statement that is currently being executed. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `is_unrated` retain their previous values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
