The `print('maybe')` statement outputs the string 'maybe' to the console but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state of the variables remains the same after the execution. 

Output State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is equal to n - 1, `n` is between 2 and 1000, `rated` is False, and 'maybe' has been printed.**
