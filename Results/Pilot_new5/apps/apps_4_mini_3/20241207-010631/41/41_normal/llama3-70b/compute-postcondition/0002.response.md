The code assigns an empty list to `ratings_after`, which is a new list independent of the previous state of any other variables. The values of `n` and `ratings_before` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list `[]`; `ratings_after` is an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list `[]`; `ratings_after` is an empty list `[]`.**
