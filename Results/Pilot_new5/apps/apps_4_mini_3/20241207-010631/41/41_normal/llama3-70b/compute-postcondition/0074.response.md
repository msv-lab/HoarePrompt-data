To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the loop variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2, since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to `n-1`. 

Given the state:
- `unrated` can be either True or False, but this does not impact the loop execution since it is not a loop control variable.
- `n` must be between 2 and 1000, inclusive, for the loop to execute.

Thus, before the loop starts, we can assume that:
- `i` is initialized at 0 for the first iteration.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`unrated` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 1000**.
