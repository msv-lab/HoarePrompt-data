The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
