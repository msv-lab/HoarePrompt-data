The code appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The variable `ratings_after` is updated to include `b` as an additional element. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the change to `ratings_after`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` will take values from 0 to n-1 during the iterations, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a` appended to it, `ratings_after` now includes the value of `b` appended to it.**
