Postcondition: ***`unrated` is a boolean indicating if there are differences between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `rated` is True, then `unrated` indicates if any ratings differ, `i` can be `n - 1` if all ratings are the same, or some value less than `n - 1` if a difference was found, and `n` is between 2 and 1000. If `rated` is False, then `unrated` reflects whether there are differences; if `unrated` is True, `i` is less than `n - 1`, while if `unrated` is False, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `n` remains in the range of 2 to 1000, leading to different outputs based on the conditions met.***
