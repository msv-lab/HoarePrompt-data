The values of `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes two integers from the input and converts them to integers. The previous values of `ratings_before` included the value of `a` twice, and `ratings_after` included the value of `b` twice. After this code executes, `a` and `b` will hold the values of the integers input by the user. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice.**
