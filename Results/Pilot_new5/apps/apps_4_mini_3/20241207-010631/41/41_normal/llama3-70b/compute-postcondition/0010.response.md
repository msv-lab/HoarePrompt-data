`ratings_after` is updated to include the value of `b`. The previous state of `ratings_after` included the value of `b`, so after appending `b`, `ratings_after` will have `b` included twice. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice**.
