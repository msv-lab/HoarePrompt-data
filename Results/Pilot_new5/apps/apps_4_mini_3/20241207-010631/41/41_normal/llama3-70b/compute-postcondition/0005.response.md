The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. Since `ratings_before` is an existing list, its length will increase by one, and the new element will be the value of `a`. The values of `n`, `_`, and `b` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` will take values from 0 to n-1 during the iterations, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a` appended to it.**
