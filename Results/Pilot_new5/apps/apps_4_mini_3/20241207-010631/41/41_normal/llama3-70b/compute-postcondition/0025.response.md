According to the loop structure, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. In the given state, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. This means that the loop has executed for `j` equal to 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we check the boundary condition: `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is between 2 and 1000, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2 and must still satisfy the condition `j < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
