The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` has iterated from 1 to `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
