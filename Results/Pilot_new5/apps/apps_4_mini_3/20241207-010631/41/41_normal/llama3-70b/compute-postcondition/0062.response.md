`unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are unchanged, but we still know that `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2**
