The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside, which processes the values of `j` from 2 to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop that checks the conditions involving `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.
