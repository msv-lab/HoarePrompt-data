According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means `j` will begin at 1 since `i` is 0. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Thus, before the loop starts, `unrated` is True, `i` is 0, and we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1. The initial value of `j` will be 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`unrated` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
