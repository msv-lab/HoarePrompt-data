According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts with `j` having a value of 3. Since the loop iterates from `i + 1` (which is 2) to `n`, `j` can take on values from 3 to at least 999 if `n` is 1000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and since `n` is between 3 and 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4. 

Additionally, we must ensure that `n` remains greater than 4 to allow for further iterations. 

State: **`n` is between 3 and 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
