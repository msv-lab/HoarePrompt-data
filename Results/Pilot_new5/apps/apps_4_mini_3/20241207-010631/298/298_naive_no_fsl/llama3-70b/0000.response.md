To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic and identify any potential edge cases or missing scenarios.

The problem requires us to find three integer points such that they form a triangle with a specific area of \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The program checks if \( n \times m \% k \) is non-zero, and if so, it prints "NO". This is a correct initial check to ensure that the area can be considered as an integer.

Next, the program uses the function `func_3(n, m)` to compute values \( n1, m1, g \) which seem to be related to the coefficients needed to form the triangle vertices. It checks if \( abs(n1 \times m) \) is greater than or equal to \( g \) to decide whether to print the coordinates or "NO".

Here are the potential issues and considerations:

1. The area must be non-negative and \( \frac{nm}{k} \) must be an integer. The program checks for the integer condition, but there might be cases where \( k \) is too large relative to \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in a value greater than the maximum possible area from the triangle vertices chosen (which can be up to \(\frac{1}{2} n m\)).
  
2. The program outputs the coordinates based on the result of `func_3`. However, it does not explicitly check if the calculated coordinates are valid within the bounds \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \).

3. The values \( n1 \) and \( m1 \) should ideally be calculated in such a way that they ensure that the triangle area condition is met, but the logic in the function `func_3` does not guarantee that \( (0, n1 \cdot m / g) \) and \( (m1 \cdot m / g, 0) \) fall within valid ranges.

### Example of a Failure Case:
Consider the input:
```
n = 1
m = 1
k = 3
```
In this case, \( nm/k = 1/3 \), which is not a valid area for a triangle since it is not an integer. The program will output "NO", which is correct. However, if we increase \( k \) further while keeping \( n \) and \( m \) the same, such as:
```
n = 1
m = 1
k = 5
```
The program will still output "NO" but it misses checking other configurations that might yield valid triangles. There are no checks for those cases leading to unexpected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee valid outputs for all potential edge cases as per the problem statement, especially in determining valid triangle vertices within the given bounds. 

Correctness: **False**
