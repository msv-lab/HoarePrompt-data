To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements and how the code meets those requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**: The program accepts three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) which represent the dimensions of a rectangle and a divisor for calculating the area of a triangle.
2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle that needs to be formed is \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - If the calculated area is not a positive integer, the output should be "NO".
   - If a valid area exists, three integer points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \) must be provided such that:
     - The area of the triangle formed by these points equals the calculated area.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program first calculates the area and checks if it is an integer.
2. If the area is not an integer or if it is zero, it prints "NO".
3. If the area is positive, it prints "YES" and starts generating coordinates:
   - It checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( n \). If true, it outputs three points including the computed coordinates.
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is greater than \( n \), it checks if it is less than or equal to \( m \) for determining different coordinates to print.
   - If both conditions fail, it outputs points based on \( n \) and \( m \).

### Correctness Check:
- The program performs proper checks for the area being an integer and non-zero.
- The output coordinates are generated based on the area condition, ensuring that they are valid integer points within the bounds \( [0, n] \) and \( [0, m] \).
- The area of the triangle formed by the points printed as output indeed corresponds to the calculated area, as the coordinates are chosen methodically based on the conditions set forth.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements set out in the problem description. It correctly handles all specified edge cases, including the checks for valid areas and point generation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
