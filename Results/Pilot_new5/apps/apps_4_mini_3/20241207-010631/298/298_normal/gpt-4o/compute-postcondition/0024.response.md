Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input. If `area` is not an integer (i.e., `area != int(area)`), 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is an integer, then if `area` is 0, it remains 0. If `area` is not 0, 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` are printed, followed by '0 1'. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`, '1 0' is printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the printed values are `0` and `m // 2`.***
