Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. If `area` is 0, then `area` remains 0. Otherwise, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k` and is not equal to 0; 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` are printed, followed by '0 1'. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`, the output is '1 0'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the printed values are `0` and `m // 2`.***
