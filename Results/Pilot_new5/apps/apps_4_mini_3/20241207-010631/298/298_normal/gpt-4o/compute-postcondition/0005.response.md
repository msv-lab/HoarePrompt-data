`area` is assigned the value `int(area)`, which means it is converted to an integer. Given that `area` is already an integer (as per the initial state), its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the other variables remain unaffected as well.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and remains unchanged as an integer.**
