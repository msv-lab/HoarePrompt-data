The code prints the values of `n` and `m // 2`. The value of `m` is divided by 2 using integer division, which means the result is the largest integer less than or equal to `m / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` as an integer and is not equal to 0; the string 'YES' has been printed; '0 0' has been printed; it is true that `2 * area` is greater than `n`; and `2 * area` is greater than `m`; printed values are `n` and `m // 2`.**
