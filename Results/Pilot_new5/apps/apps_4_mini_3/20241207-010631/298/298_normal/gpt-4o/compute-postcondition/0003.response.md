The code executes a print statement which outputs 'NO'. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged as the print statement does not alter any variable values. Therefore, the output state excludes any changes to the variables but acknowledges the print action.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and 'NO' has been printed.**
