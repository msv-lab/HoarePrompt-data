The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (input directly from the user), calculates the area as `n * m / k`, and checks if the area is a non-zero integer. If the area is not an integer or is zero, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a valid positive integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by coordinates based on the condition of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. Specifically, it prints coordinates based on whether `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, equal to `m`, or greater than `m`.
