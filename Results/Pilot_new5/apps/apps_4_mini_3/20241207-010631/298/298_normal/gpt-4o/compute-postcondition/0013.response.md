The code executes a print statement which outputs the string '0 1'. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged since the print operation does not affect their values. Thus, we will keep their states as is. The previous prints do not affect the current state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` as an integer and is not equal to 0; the string 'YES' has been printed; '0 0' has been printed; `2 * area` is printed along with `1`; '0 1' has been printed.**
