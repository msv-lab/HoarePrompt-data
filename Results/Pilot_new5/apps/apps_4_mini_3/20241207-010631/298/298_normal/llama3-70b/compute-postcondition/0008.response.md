The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, and they are constrained to be non-negative (i.e., `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`). The function returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Since `b` is 0, the value of `a` remains unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0.**
