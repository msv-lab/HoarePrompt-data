The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. The values of `x` and `y` are guaranteed to be non-negative integers, and `x * a + y * b` will be an integer as a result of the multiplication and addition operations.
