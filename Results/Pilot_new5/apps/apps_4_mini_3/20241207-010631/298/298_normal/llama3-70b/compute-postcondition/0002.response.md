The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing dimensions related to the problem. The function calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain non-negative integers `x` and `y`. The function returns the values of `x` and `y`, as well as the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, which is an integer. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return a tuple containing non-negative integers `x` and `y`, along with the integer result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, returns a tuple (x, y, result) where x and y are non-negative integers and result is the value of the expression x * a + y * b.**
