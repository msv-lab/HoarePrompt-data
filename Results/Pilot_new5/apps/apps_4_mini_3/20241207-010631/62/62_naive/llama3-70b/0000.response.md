To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown
1. The input consists of two numbers represented in different bases.
2. We need to convert both numbers from their respective bases to a common base (base 10).
3. After conversion, we compare the two numbers and print:
   - '<' if the first number is less than the second,
   - '>' if the first number is greater than the second,
   - '=' if both numbers are equal.

### Analyzing the Code
- The program reads the input correctly.
- It uses a helper function `func_1` to convert the digits from the given base to base 10.
- The comparison of the two converted numbers is done correctly.

### Potential Edge Cases
However, let's consider potential edge cases to ensure every possible scenario is handled:
1. **Leading Zeroes**: Although the problem states there will be no leading zeroes, we must ensure that the program handles cases where it might incorrectly interpret a number due to construction (though it states there will be no leading zeros).
2. **Base Restrictions**: The function assumes inputs will correctly conform to the given limitations (`0 ≤ x_i < b_x` and `0 ≤ y_i < b_y`). Improper inputs could cause misbehavior, but the problem guarantees valid inputs.
3. **Different Lengths**: The program seems to handle differently sized inputs, but the comparison after conversion handles that inherently since it compares the integer values.
4. **Maximum Input Values**: The largest values allowed for each base (like `39` in base `40`) should be handled correctly, and since the digits are processed one at a time, it should work accurately.

### Testing Cases
1. **Minimum Input Values**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     1 2
     0
     1 3
     0
     ```
   - Expected output: `=`
   - The program should return `=` because both are zero.

2. **Different Bases**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 2
     1
     1 3
     0
     ```
   - Expected output: `>`
   - The program should return `>` because 1 (in base 2) is greater than 0 (in base 3).

### Conclusion
After evaluating the code and considering edge cases, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description. It accurately converts the numbers and performs the necessary comparison. Thus, the program is reliable based on the constraints provided, and it behaves as expected for all potential valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
