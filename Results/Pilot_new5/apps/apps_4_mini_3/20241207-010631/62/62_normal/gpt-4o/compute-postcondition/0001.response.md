According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `decimal_value` is 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit. 

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, `decimal_value` is 0**
