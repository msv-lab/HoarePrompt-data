Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the specifications outlined in the problem description. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input consisting of two numbers represented in different bases, as specified. It captures the number of digits and their respective bases accurately.

2. **Functionality**: The `func_1` function takes a list of digits and a base, and it converts the number from that base to its decimal representation. The conversion follows the standard method of calculating the value of a number in a given base by multiplying each digit by its base raised to the power of its position, thus correctly rendering the number into decimal.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers (X and Y) to their decimal equivalents, the program compares these values:
   - It prints '<' if `decimal_x` is less than `decimal_y`, '>' if greater, and '=' if they are equal.
   - This comparison correctly reflects the relationships defined in the problem statement.

4. **Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints outlined in the problem description, such as the limits on the number of digits and the valid ranges for the bases.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly accounts for all edge cases outlined in the problem description, including different digit lengths and bases, as well as ensuring no leading zeros.

In summary, the program fulfills all requirements of the problem description, accurately converting numbers from different bases to decimal and then comparing them, ensuring correctness across all potential input scenarios defined by the problem.
