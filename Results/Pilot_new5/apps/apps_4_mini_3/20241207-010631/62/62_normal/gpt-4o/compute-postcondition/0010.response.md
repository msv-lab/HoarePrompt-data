Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` within the range of 2 to 40. It converts the number represented by these digits in the given base to its decimal representation and returns this value. If `digits` is an empty list, the function returns 0. **
