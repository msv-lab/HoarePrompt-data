#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of the number in base `base`, where each digit is in the range 0 <= digit < base, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal_value` is the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` in base `base`, where `digits` is a list of integers and `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40. If `digits` is empty, `decimal_value` is 0.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` in base `base`, which is represented by `decimal_value`. If `digits` is empty, `decimal_value` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` within the range of 2 to 40. It converts the number represented by these digits in the given base to its decimal representation and returns this value. If `digits` is an empty list, the function returns 0.
