According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 digits, the loop will execute again for the third digit. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 digits, and `digit` is the second digit in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 digits, and `digit` should be updated to the third digit in the list.

State: **`result` is equal to `digit * base + digit`, `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list.**
