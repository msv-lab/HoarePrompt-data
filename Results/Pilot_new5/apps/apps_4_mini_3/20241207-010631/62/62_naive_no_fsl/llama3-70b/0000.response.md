Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits from a specified base to its integer representation. The program compares the two numbers after conversion and outputs the correct relational operator ('<', '>', or '=') based on their values.

I cannot find any example inputs that would cause the program to fail or produce incorrect outputs, as it handles all specified input ranges and constraints effectively. It correctly accounts for the specified bases and digit values, ensuring proper conversion and comparison. Thus, I believe the program is correct.
