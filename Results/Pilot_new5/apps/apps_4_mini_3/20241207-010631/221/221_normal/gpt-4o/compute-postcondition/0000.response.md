Initial State: `s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12, and `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12.

In the provided code snippet, `a` is assigned the value of `b` XOR `x`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `b`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. Therefore, the relationship remains unclear in terms of specific numeric output. 

The values of `s` and `x` are unchanged by this operation, and the only variable impacted is `a`, which is now defined in terms of `b` and `x`. 

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12; `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12; `a` is equal to `b` XOR `x`.**
