The value of `b` is assigned as `s - a`. Given that `s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\) and `a` is 2, the value of `b` will be `s - 2`. The states of the other variables (`x` and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), `a` is 2, and `b` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\) (specifically `s - 2`).

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\); `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\); `a` is 2; `b` is equal to `s - 2` which is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\)**.
