The values of `s` and `x` are assigned based on user input, where both are converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\) and `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\). The exact new values of `s` and `x` will depend on the input provided during execution, but they will remain within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`s` is an input positive integer between 2 and 10^12; `x` is an input non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12.**
