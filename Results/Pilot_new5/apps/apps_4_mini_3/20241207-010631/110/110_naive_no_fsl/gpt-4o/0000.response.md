Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the `coverage` function. Specifically, the calculation in the coverage function does not properly assess the actual coverage of the scoop-net in relation to the positions of the fishes in the pond. 

The current implementation of the `coverage` function attempts to calculate how many of the fishes can be caught based on the scoop's position. However, it does not accurately determine the range of valid positions for the scoop based on the boundaries of the pond and the scoop size. 

To illustrate this, consider the following edge case:
- Input: `1 1 1 1` (a pond of size 1x1 with a scoop of size 1x1 and 1 fish to place).
  
The expected output should be `1.0`, since the only fish can be placed in the single cell, and the scoop will definitely catch it.

However, due to the incorrect logic in the coverage calculation, the program may produce an unexpected result, leading to an incorrect average number of caught fishes.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
