The code calculates `total_positions` as the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. Since `n`, `m`, and `r` are all positive integers, `total_positions` will also be a positive integer derived from these values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(n * m - k)` tuples, `total_coverage` is the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` popped tuples, `cov`, `x`, `y` are the respective values from the last popped tuple, `total_positions` is equal to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(n * m - k)` tuples, `total_coverage` is the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` popped tuples, `cov`, `x`, `y` are the respective values from the last popped tuple, `total_positions` is equal to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**.
