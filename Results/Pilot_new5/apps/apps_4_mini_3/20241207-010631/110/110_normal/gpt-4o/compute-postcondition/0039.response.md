The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond. The parameter `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells of the pond. 

After executing the function body, it returns the ratio of `total_coverage`, which is the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` popped tuples, to `total_positions`, calculated as (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and return the ratio of the negative sum of the last `k` coverages to the total positions available in the pond after accounting for the scoop size. 

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n, m, r, and k, and returns the ratio of the negative sum of the last k coverages to the total positions available in the pond, calculated as (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).**
