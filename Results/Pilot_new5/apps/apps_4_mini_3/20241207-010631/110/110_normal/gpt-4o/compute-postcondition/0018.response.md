According to the code, the loop executes over `y` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. For the loop to execute, the value of `m` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.

At the start of the loop:
- `y` will take values starting from 0 up to `m-1`.
- The initial value of `y` before the first iteration will be set to 0, as `range(m)` starts at 0.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute:
- `y` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m` tuples including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, ..., `(-coverage(1, m-1), 1, m-1)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0**
