You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop, and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells of the pond, with the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to analyze the given loop and the initial state. The loop iterates over the dimensions of the pond defined by `n` and `m`, pushing tuples into the `heap` for each cell in the pond.
    #
    #1. The outer loop runs `n` times (for each row `x` from `0` to `n-1`).
    #2. The inner loop runs `m` times (for each column `y` from `0` to `m-1`).
    #
    #After both loops complete:
    #- The total number of iterations will be `n * m`, meaning the `heap` will contain `n * m` tuples.
    #- Each tuple in the `heap` contains the negative coverage of the corresponding cell in the pond, the row index `x`, and the column index `y`.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `x` in the range from `0` to `n-1` and each `y` in the range from `0` to `m-1`.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(n * m - k)` tuples, `total_coverage` is the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` popped tuples, `cov`, `x`, `y` are the respective values from the last popped tuple.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the ratio of total_coverage, which is the negative sum of the coverages from the last k popped tuples, to total_positions, which is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and calculates the ratio of the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` cells with the highest coverage in a pond grid of dimensions `n` by `m` to the total positions available for placing a scoop of size `r`, which is given by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). This ratio is returned as a float. The function does not handle cases where `k` is greater than the total number of cells (`n * m`), which could lead to issues when trying to pop more elements from the heap than are available.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the scoop-net, where 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, while n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, and r is a positive integer such that 1 <= r <= min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area of the scoop-net defined by the coordinates (x, y) and radius r within the dimensions (n, m) of the pond, calculated using the formula which takes into account the constraints imposed by the edges of the pond.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative integer coordinates `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `r`. It calculates and returns the area of a scoop-net defined by these coordinates and the radius `r`, constrained within a pond of dimensions `n` by `m`. However, the function lacks parameters for `n` and `m`, which should be provided to the function for it to operate correctly. As it stands, the function will raise a NameError when trying to access `n` and `m`, indicating missing context for the calculation.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
