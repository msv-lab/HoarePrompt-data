To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the line:

```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

1. The code is pushing a new tuple into the `heap`. The tuple consists of three elements:
   - `-coverage(x, y)`: This represents the negative value of the result returned by the `coverage` function when called with `x` and `y`.
   - `x`: This is equal to `1` (as per the initial state).
   - `y`: This is also equal to `1` (as per the initial state).

2. The existing `heap` contains `m + 1` tuples before the execution of this line, which includes `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and previously `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.

3. The only values that will change due to this line of code are the contents of the `heap` list, where a new tuple is being added.

After executing the code, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 2` tuples including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `(-coverage(x, y), 1, 1)` and previously `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1.**
