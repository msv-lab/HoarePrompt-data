To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the maximum expected number of caught fishes when placing `k` fishes in a pond of size `n × m`, given a scoop size of `r × r`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` which represent the pond's dimensions, scoop size, and the number of fishes to be placed, respectively. This is correctly aligned with the problem description.

2. **Coverage Calculation**:
   - The function `coverage(x, y)` is intended to calculate how many cells (fishes) would be caught if the scoop was placed at the lower-left corner at position `(x, y)`. It uses a specific formula to ensure that the scoop stays within the bounds of the pond while counting the number of reachable cells. 

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The program utilizes a max-heap (by pushing negative coverage values) to efficiently find the top `k` positions that yield the highest coverage (maximum fishes caught). This step ensures that the fishes are placed in the optimal locations allowing for maximum catch when the scoop is randomly thrown.

4. **Total Coverage**:
   - The program sums the coverage of the top `k` positions from the heap, which represents the maximum number of fishes that can be caught given the scoop's position. It then divides this by the total possible scoop placements, `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

5. **Returning the Expected Value**:
   - Finally, the program returns the expected value of the number of caught fishes as a floating-point number formatted to 10 decimal places, which aligns with the output requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The approach of maximizing the total coverage from the best `k` positions is correct. The method ensures that the fishes are distributed in a way that maximizes the expected catch when the scoop is placed randomly.
- Since all mathematical operations respect the conditions of the problem (with proper bounds checking and average calculations), the program correctly adheres to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program indeed follows the requirements laid out in the problem description and handles edge cases properly, such as ensuring the scoop fits inside the pond and counting distinct cell placements for fishes.

Correctness: **True**
