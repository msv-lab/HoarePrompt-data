Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `heap` contains `(n * m - 3)` tuples, `cov` is a specific value from the popped tuple, `x` is a specific value from the popped tuple, `y` is a specific value from the popped tuple, `total_coverage` is equal to `-2 * cov - cov`, which simplifies to `total_coverage` is equal to `-3 * cov`.**
