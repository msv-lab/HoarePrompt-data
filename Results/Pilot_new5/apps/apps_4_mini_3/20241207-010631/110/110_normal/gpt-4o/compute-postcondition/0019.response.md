The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the `heap`. The tuple consists of three elements: 
1. The negative coverage of `(x, y)`, which is `-coverage(2, 0)` because `x` is 2 and `y` is 0.
2. The value of `x`, which is 2.
3. The value of `y`, which is 0.

The `heap` originally contains `m` tuples, and the new tuple will be added to it.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, and `heap` are updated as follows:
- `heap` will now contain `m + 1` tuples, including the new tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 1` tuples including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, ..., `(-coverage(1, m-1), 1, m-1)`, and `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 1` tuples including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, ..., `(-coverage(1, m-1), 1, m-1)`, and `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0**.
