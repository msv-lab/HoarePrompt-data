The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and calculates the ratio of the negative sum of the coverages from the last `k` cells with the highest coverage in a pond grid of dimensions `n` by `m` to the total positions available for placing a scoop of size `r`, which is given by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). This ratio is returned as a float. The function does not handle cases where `k` is greater than the total number of cells (`n * m`), which could lead to issues when trying to pop more elements from the heap than are available.
