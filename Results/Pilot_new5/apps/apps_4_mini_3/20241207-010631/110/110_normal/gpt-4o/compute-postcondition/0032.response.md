The value of `total_coverage` is modified by subtracting the value of `cov` from it. The variable `total_coverage` was initially `-cov` and is now updated to `-cov - cov`, which simplifies to `-2 * cov`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(n * m - 2)` tuples, `total_coverage` is `-2 * cov`, `cov`, `x`, `y` are assigned values from the popped tuple from `heap`.**
