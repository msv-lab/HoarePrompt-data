The variable `k` is assigned the value `2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and valid as an input positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n\) is greater than \(2\). Therefore, the updated state of the affected variables is `k = 2`, with `n` still holding its previous valid input state.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `k` is 2**
