The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is still equal to 2 and include the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is equal to 2; output is 'NO'**
