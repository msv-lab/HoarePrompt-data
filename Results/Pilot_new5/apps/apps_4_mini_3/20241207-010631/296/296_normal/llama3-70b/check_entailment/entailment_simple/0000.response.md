Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Output for n = 2**: The program correctly outputs "NO" for \( n = 2 \) because there are no valid values of \( b_i \) that satisfy the conditions (1 < \( b_i \) < \( n \)). This part is correct.

2. **Output for n > 2**: When \( n \) is greater than 2, the program prints "YES" and sets \( k = 2 \). It then outputs the fractions '1' with \( n // 2 \) and '1' with \( n \). However, this does not ensure that the fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) satisfy the problem's condition that \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \) for all \( i \).

3. **Incorrect Fraction Values**:
   - When the program outputs '1' and \( n \), it fails to meet the requirement that \( b_i \) should be a divisor of \( n \), as \( n \) itself cannot be used as a denominator (since \( b_i \) must be less than \( n \)).
   - The output '1', \( n // 2 \) does not guarantee that \( n // 2 \) divides \( n \) for all \( n \), particularly for odd values of \( n \).

4. **Sum of Fractions**: The program does not verify whether the sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It merely prints two arbitrary fractions that do not necessarily satisfy this condition.

Due to these issues, the program fails to correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it is incorrect.
