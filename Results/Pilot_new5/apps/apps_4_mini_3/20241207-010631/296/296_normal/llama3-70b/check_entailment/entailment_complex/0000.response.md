Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

1. **Handling `n = 2`:** The program correctly returns "NO" when `n = 2`, which is appropriate according to the problem requirements since there are no valid fractions that can satisfy the conditions provided (i.e., there are no divisors of `n` between `1` and `n`).

2. **Handling `n > 2`:** The program returns "YES" and prints a sequence with two fractions:
   - It prints '1' and `n // 2`
   - It prints '1' and `n`

   However, these fractions do not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:
   - For the fraction `1/n`, `b = n` is not valid because the problem specifies that `b_i` must satisfy `1 < b_i < n`. Here, `b_i = n` is not strictly less than `n`.
   - The fraction `1/(n // 2)` is only valid if `n // 2` divides `n` and if it falls within the range specified (i.e., `1 < n // 2 < n`). The program does not account for the requirement of `1 < b_i < n` properly, especially for even values of `n`.
   - The program does not check if the sum of the fractions actually equals `1 - 1/n`, which is a crucial part of the problem.

In summary, while the program handles the base case for `n = 2` well, it fails to generate a proper sequence of fractions for values of `n > 2`, thus not fulfilling the problem description's conditions.
