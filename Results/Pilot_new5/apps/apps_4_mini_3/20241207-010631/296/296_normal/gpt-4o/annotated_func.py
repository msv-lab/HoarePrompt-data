    if (n <= 2) :

        #The program returns 'NO' since the current value of n is less than or equal to 2.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2. If no divisors are found, `divisors` remains an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO' indicating that no divisors were found in the list `divisors`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2. Additionally, `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning that at least one divisor of `n` exists which is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string formatted as 'YES' followed by the length of the divisors list `k`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and then each tuple (1, d) from the `fractions` list where d is a divisor of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it returns 'NO'. If `n` has divisors, it returns 'YES' along with the count of divisors and their corresponding tuples in the format (1, divisor). The function does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number correctly, as it would still return 'YES' with an empty divisor list if no divisors are found, while it should return 'NO' instead. Additionally, it does not explicitly handle cases for very large values of `n`, which could lead to performance issues in practice.
