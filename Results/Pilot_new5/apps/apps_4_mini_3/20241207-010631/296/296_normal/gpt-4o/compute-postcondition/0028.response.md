The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. 

- If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'.
- If no divisors were found in the list `divisors`, the function returns the string 'NO'.
- If there are divisors found, the function returns a string formatted as 'YES' followed by the length of the divisors list `k`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and then returns each tuple (1, d) from the `fractions` list where d is a divisor of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, and return 'NO' for values less than or equal to 2 or when no divisors are found, or return 'YES' with details about the divisors when they exist. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, returns 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 2, returns 'NO' if no divisors are found, or returns 'YES' with the number of divisors and their corresponding tuples if divisors exist.**
