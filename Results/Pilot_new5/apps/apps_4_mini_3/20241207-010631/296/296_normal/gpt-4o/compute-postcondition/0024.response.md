Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2. Additionally, `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning that at least one divisor of `n` exists which is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`.***
