The value of `n` is a positive integer of at least 4, and `i` is 2. The expression `n // i` calculates the integer division of `n` by `i`. Since `i` is not equal to `n // i`, we can conclude that `n` is not equal to 4 (because if `n` were 4, then `i` would equal `n // i`, which is 2). The value of `divisors` is modified by appending the result of `n // i` to it.

Thus, `divisors` will become `[2, n // 2]`, where `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 4, `divisors` is [2, n // 2], `i` is 2, and `i` is not equal to `n // i`.**
