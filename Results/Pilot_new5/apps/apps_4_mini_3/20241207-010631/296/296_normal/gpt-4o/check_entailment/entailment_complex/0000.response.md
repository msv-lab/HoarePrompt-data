The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Prime Numbers**: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a prime number. According to the problem description, if `n` is prime, there should be no valid fractions since the only divisors would be 1 and `n` itself, which do not satisfy the condition `1 < b_i < n`. However, the program would incorrectly return "YES" as it checks for divisors only up to the square root of `n`, and if there are no divisors found, it would end up returning "YES" with an empty list of fractions, which is not valid.

2. **Condition for Fractions**: The program generates fractions of the form `(1, d)` for each divisor `d` of `n`. However, this does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will equal `1 - 1/n`. The fractions must not only satisfy the form of `1 < b_i < n`, but also the sum must be equal to the target value, which the current implementation does not verify.

3. **Return Value for `n = 2`**: The check for `n <= 2` is in the program, but it should correctly identify that `n = 2` results in "NO" as specified in the problem description. The program currently returns 'NO', which is correct for this specific case, but there are many other cases where it can incorrectly return 'YES'.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program does not ensure that the output format strictly follows the requirement specified in the problem description, especially regarding how the fractions are generated and presented. It assumes that all divisors will lead to a valid output without checking the conditions thoroughly.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem requirements in a general sense, particularly when it comes to prime numbers and ensuring the correct sum of fractions.

Correctness: **False**
