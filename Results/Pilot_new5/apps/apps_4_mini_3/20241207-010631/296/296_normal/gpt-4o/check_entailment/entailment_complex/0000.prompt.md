You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' since the current value of n is less than or equal to 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2.
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2. If no divisors are found, `divisors` remains an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO' indicating that no divisors were found in the list `divisors`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2. Additionally, `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning that at least one divisor of `n` exists which is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string formatted as 'YES' followed by the length of the divisors list `k`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and then each tuple (1, d) from the `fractions` list where d is a divisor of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it returns 'NO'. If `n` has divisors, it returns 'YES' along with the count of divisors and their corresponding tuples in the format (1, divisor). The function does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number correctly, as it would still return 'YES' with an empty divisor list if no divisors are found, while it should return 'NO' instead. Additionally, it does not explicitly handle cases for very large values of `n`, which could lead to performance issues in practice.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
