To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we will break down the requirements:

1. The program should find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
   - \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
   - \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \).
   - The sum of these fractions should equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

2. The input is a positive integer \( n \) where \( 2 \le n \le 10^9 \).

3. The program outputs "YES" if such a sequence exists, otherwise "NO".

4. If "YES", it should output the number of fractions \( k \) and then \( k \) lines of the fractions.

Now, let's evaluate the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
```

### Analysis of the Code

- The code correctly outputs "NO" when \( n = 2 \), which is consistent with the fact that there are no valid denominators \( b_i \) that meet the requirements (since there are no integers \( 1 < b_i < 2 \)).
  
- For any \( n > 2 \), it outputs "YES" and suggests two fractions:
  - \( \frac{1}{n//2} \)
  - \( \frac{1}{n} \)

### Issues with the Code

1. **Denominator Check**:
   - While \( n//2 \) is a valid fraction's denominator for \( n > 2 \), it only checks for \( n \) being even. For odd \( n \), \( n//2 \) does not yield a valid fraction \( \frac{1}{b_i} \) with \( b_i \) being an integer greater than 1. For example, for \( n = 3 \), this would output fractions of \( \frac{1}{1} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \), but \( 1 \) is not a valid denominator as per the requirement \( 1 < b_i < n \).

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The fractions generated do not always satisfy \( \sum \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). For \( n = 4 \), the output is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 \) which does not equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = 0.75 \) but fails overall since \( \frac{1}{4} \) is not in the range of \( 1 < b_i < 4 \).

### Conclusion

Given that the program does not consistently produce valid fractions that meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.
