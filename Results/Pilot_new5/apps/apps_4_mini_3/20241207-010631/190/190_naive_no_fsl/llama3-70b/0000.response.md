To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code step-by-step with a focus on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
1. We have `n` sticks with given positive integer lengths.
2. We can change stick lengths at a cost equal to the absolute difference between the original and new lengths.
3. We need to find a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for `t` (meaning the adjusted lengths should be within 1 unit of `t`) while minimizing the total cost.
4. The output should be the optimal `t` and the minimum cost.

### Code Analysis
1. The program first reads the number of sticks and their lengths into a list called `sticks`.
2. It sorts the `sticks` list.
3. It computes a median-like variable `mid` (the middle element of the sorted list).
4. It initializes `min_cost` with the cost of changing all sticks to match `mid`.
5. The program then checks for optimal `t` values by iterating from `mid - 1` to `1`, and from `mid + 1` to `100`.
6. For each candidate `t`, it calculates the cost of adjusting all sticks to be either `t`, `t+1`, or `t-1`.
7. Finally, it prints the best `t` along with the minimum cost found.

### Potential Issues
1. The program does not explicitly handle the case where `mid` is `1`. In this case, the loop iterating from `mid - 1` to `0` would not execute since it goes to `1`, and hence it would not check `t = 1`. However, consider the input:
   ```
   1
   1
   ```
   The expected output should be `1 0` (no cost and already almost good). The code falls short since `min_t` would still be initialized to `mid` which is `1`, and it would not account for costs correctly in this case.

2. The given constraints allow stick lengths from `1` to `100`, but it initializes `i` going up to `101`. The program does not evaluate what happens if all sticks are already at the maximum length.

3. The condition for "almost good" states that the lengths must be within `1` unit of `t`, meaning `t-1`, `t`, or `t+1` are valid lengths after adjusting. The calculation logic needs to ensure that adjustments are properly aligned to fit this criterion.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly handle edge cases, particularly when the only available stick length is `1`, which could lead to incorrect minimum costs or outputs. Given that there are potential inputs where the program does not yield the correct expected behavior as described, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
