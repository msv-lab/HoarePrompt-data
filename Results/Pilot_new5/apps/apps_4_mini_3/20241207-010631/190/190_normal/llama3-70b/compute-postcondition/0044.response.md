Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= a_i <= 100). It computes the value `t` that minimizes the total cost of adjusting each integer in the list to `t`, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each integer and `t`. The function considers values of `t` from `mid - 1` down to 1 and from `mid + 1` up to 100, where `mid` is the median value of the sorted list. Finally, it prints the optimal value of `t` that results in the minimum cost along with that minimum cost.**
