Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is greater than 1; `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `i`; `i` is equal to `mid - 1`; `min_t` is now equal to `i` which is `mid - 1`.**
