Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is less than or equal to 99; `i` is equal to `mid + 1`; `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `min_cost` and `min_t`.***
