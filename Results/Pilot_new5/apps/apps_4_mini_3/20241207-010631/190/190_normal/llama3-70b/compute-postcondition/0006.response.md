`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` represents the sum of absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `mid`. Since `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, this value will be preserved. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of n integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
