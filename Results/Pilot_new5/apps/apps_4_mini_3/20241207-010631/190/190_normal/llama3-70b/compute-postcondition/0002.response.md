The code `sticks.sort()` sorts the list `sticks` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, but the order of the elements in `sticks` is modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of n integers based on input.**
