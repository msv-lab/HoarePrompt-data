Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is less than or equal to 99; `min_cost` is the minimum computed cost across all values of `i` from `mid + 1` to 100; `min_t` is the value of `i` that resulted in `min_cost`; `t` remains equal to the original value of `mid`; `min_t` is printed along with `min_cost`.**
