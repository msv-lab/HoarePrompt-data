Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the conditions applied to all integers in `a` relative to `t`, and `length` is the last integer in the list `a` processed in the loop. If all lengths are between `t - 1` and `t + 1`, `current_cost` remains 0.**
