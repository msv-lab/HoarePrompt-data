Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the conditions applied to all integers in `a` relative to `t`, `length` is the last integer in the list `a` processed in the loop, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
