Postcondition: ***`min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` is 101, and `length` is the third element in `a`, which contains at least 3 elements. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 100), then `current_cost` is either `300 - 2 * length` (if `length` is less than 100) or `98 - length` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100). If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is either `98` (if `length` is less than 100) or `length - 104` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100), and if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated accordingly.***
