The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its current value. The variables `n`, `a`, and `length` are defined based on the input and the initial conditions, but their values remain unchanged in this operation. The output state includes the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (if available), `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`**.
