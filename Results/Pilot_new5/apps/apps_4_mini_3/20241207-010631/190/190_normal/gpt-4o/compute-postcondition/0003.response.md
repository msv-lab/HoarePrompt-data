The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is float('inf'), and `best_t` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is float('inf'); `best_t` is -1**
