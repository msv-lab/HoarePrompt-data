According to the code, the for loop iterates over each integer in the list `a`. The variable `length` takes on each value from the list `a` sequentially. At the end of the last iteration, `length` corresponds to the current integer from the list `a`, and the loop will execute again if there are more integers in the list.

Given that `n` is the total number of integers in the list `a`, the loop will execute for `length` values from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`. If the last executed `length` is `a[i]`, the next value of `length` for the next iteration will be `a[i+1]`, provided `i+1` is less than `n`.

Since `length` is updated to the next integer in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `length` must be set to the next integer, and `n` must still refer to its input constraint. 

So, if `length` is currently the last integer in the list `a`, which means `i` is `n-1`, there won't be another iteration, hence `length` would not be available. If it is not the last integer, `length` should point to the next integer in `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the next integer in the list `a` where `length` is `a[i+1]`, and `current_cost` remains unchanged.**
