Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is either `200 - length` (if `length` is less than 100) or `-2` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100) when `length < 100`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to 102, `current_cost` is updated to the previous value plus `length - 102`; if `length` is exactly 102, `current_cost` remains unchanged. In all cases, `min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` remains 101, and `length` is the second element in `a`, with `a` containing at least 2 elements.***
