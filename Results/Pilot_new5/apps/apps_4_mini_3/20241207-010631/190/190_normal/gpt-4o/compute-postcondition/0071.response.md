To determine the impact of the code, we first look at the initial state:

- `current_cost` is either `200 - length` (if `length` is less than 100) or `-2` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100).
- `min_cost` retains its updated value.
- `best_t` retains its updated value.
- `t` is `101`.
- `length` is the third element in `a`, and `a` must contain at least 3 elements.

The code we are examining is:
```
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

Now, we analyze the effects:

1. We need to determine the value of `t + 1`, which is `101 + 1 = 102`.
2. Then we consider the term `length - (t + 1)` which simplifies to `length - 102`.
3. The impact on `current_cost` depends on the initial value of `current_cost` based on the value of `length`:
   - If `length < 100`, then `current_cost` starts at `200 - length`.
   - If `length >= 100`, then `current_cost` starts at `-2`.

Now, let's update `current_cost` accordingly:

- If `length < 100`:
  - `current_cost` becomes `(200 - length) + (length - 102) = 200 - 102 = 98`.
  
- If `length >= 100`:
  - `current_cost` becomes `-2 + (length - 102) = length - 104`.

The states of `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the final output state can be specified as follows:

Output State: **`current_cost` is either 98 (if `length` is less than 100) or `length - 104` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100); `min_cost` retains its updated value; `best_t` retains its updated value; `t` is 101; `length` is the third element in `a`, `a` must contain at least 3 elements.**
