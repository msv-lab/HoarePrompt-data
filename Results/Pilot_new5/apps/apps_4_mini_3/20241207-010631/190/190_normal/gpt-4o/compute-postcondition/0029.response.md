According to the code, the loop will iterate over values of `t` from 1 to 100. If the loop has completed its current iteration, this means that `t` has been updated to the next value which is the next integer in the range. At the end of the last iteration, `t` would have reached a value such that if the loop is executed again, the next value of `t` would be this value plus 1.

Given that `t` starts at 1 and goes up to 100, and considering that the loop body is omitted, I need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. If the last iteration was with `t = 100`, the loop would not execute again since `t` would exceed the range limit.

Since the for loop does not allow for a value of `t` greater than 100, and knowing that `current_cost` and `min_cost` are dependent on `t`, the relevant states must reflect that `t` needs to be updated for the next iteration.

Thus, if `t` was 100 at the end of the previous iteration, it cannot execute again. If `t` was 99, it would change to 100, allowing for one last iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the conditions applied to all integers in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated, `best_t` is the best t found, `t` is 100**.
