The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the integer conversion of the input values split by spaces. The value of `n` indicates how many integers will be read into the list `a`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `a` will contain `n` integers, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 100.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.**
