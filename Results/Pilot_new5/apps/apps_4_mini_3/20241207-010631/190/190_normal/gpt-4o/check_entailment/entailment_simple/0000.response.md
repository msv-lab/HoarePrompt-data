To determine the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements Summary:
1. We have `n` sticks with lengths defined by the list `a`.
2. We can change the lengths of these sticks at a cost defined by `|a - b|`.
3. We need to find a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for `t`, meaning each length should satisfy `|a_i - t| â‰¤ 1`.
4. The goal is to minimize the total cost of changing the lengths of the sticks to make them "almost good" for `t`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, which meets the input requirements.
2. **Cost Calculation Loop**: 
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `t`, it calculates the current cost of changing each stick length to be "almost good" for that `t`.
   - The conditions `if length < t - 1` and `elif length > t + 1` are correctly checking the bounds for the stick lengths in relation to `t`:
     - If a stick is less than `t - 1`, it needs to be increased to `t - 1`.
     - If a stick is greater than `t + 1`, it needs to be decreased to `t + 1`.
3. **Minimum Cost Tracking**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t` that yields this minimum cost.
4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the best `t` and the associated minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. It accurately calculates the minimum cost for changing the lengths of the sticks such that they become "almost good" for some `t` between 1 and 100. 

The implementation is efficient for the constraints provided (with `n` up to 1000 and stick lengths between 1 and 100), ensuring it will run within acceptable limits. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
