The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged in value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0.
