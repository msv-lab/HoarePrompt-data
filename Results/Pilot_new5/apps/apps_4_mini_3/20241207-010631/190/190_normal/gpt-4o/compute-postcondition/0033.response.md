To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the operation being performed.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`.
   - `length` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - The current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The operation `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the value of `current_cost`.
   - We know `length < t - 1`, so `t - 1 - length` is a positive integer (since `t - 1` is greater than `length`).

As the operation modifies `current_cost`, we keep track of that variable while leaving other variables unchanged.

3. **Output State**:
The only affected variable is `current_cost`, which has been incremented by a positive value derived from `t - 1 - length`, without changing other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000, a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100, length` is the first element in the list `a`, `length` is less than `t - 1, current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`.**
