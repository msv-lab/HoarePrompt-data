The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now be an input integer that adheres to the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). The list `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
