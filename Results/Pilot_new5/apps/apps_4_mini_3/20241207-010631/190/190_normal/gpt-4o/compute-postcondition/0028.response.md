Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the conditions applied to all integers in `a` relative to `t`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to `t`.***
