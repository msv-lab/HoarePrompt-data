The code assigns the value of `v_2` to the last element of the list `speeds`. Since `speeds` is initialized with `t` zeros and `speeds[0]` is set to `v_1`, the last element (`speeds[-1]`) will now hold the value of `v_2`. The previous values of `t`, `d`, and `v_1` remain unchanged, and `speeds` is updated to reflect the new value at the last index.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1` and `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`.**
