The variables `v_1` and `v_2` are assigned values from user input, which are integers between 1 and 100. The function `map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into separate components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns them to `v_1` and `v_2`. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged. 

Since `v_1` and `v_2` are now set to the specific integers provided through input, their values can vary, but they are still constrained to the range of 1 to 100.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100.**
