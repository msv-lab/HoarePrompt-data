The code `print(total_distance)` outputs the value of `total_distance`, which is defined as the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list. The values of `speeds[0]` and `speeds[-1]` are `v_1` and `v_2`, respectively, but we do not know the values of other elements in `speeds` or whether `speeds` contains more than two elements. Therefore, `total_distance` is equal to the sum of all elements in `speeds`.

The state of the variables `speeds[0]`, `speeds[-1]`, and `total_distance` remains valid, but the action of printing does not change their values.

Output State: **`speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, `total_distance` is the sum of `speeds`, and `total_distance` has been printed.**
