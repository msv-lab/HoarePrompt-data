To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze how the variables change throughout the loop given the initial conditions.

The loop is structured to iterate from `1` to `t - 1` (i.e., `t - 1` iterations). During each iteration, the value of `speeds[i]` is computed based on the previous value `speeds[i - 1]` and the parameters `d`, `v_2`, and `t`.

1. For `i = 1`: 
   - `speeds[1]` is assigned `min(speeds[0] + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
  
2. For `i = 2`:
   - `speeds[2]` is assigned `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d`.
   
3. This continues until `i = t - 1`, where:
   - `speeds[t - 1]` is assigned `min(speeds[t - 2] + d, v_2 + 0 * d)` which simplifies to `min(speeds[t - 2] + d, v_2)`.

After all iterations are completed, the value of `speeds[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `t - 1` will be determined by the relationship established in the loop.

If `t` is exactly `2`, then the loop does not execute, and `speeds[1]` would remain unchanged based on its initial value.

If `t` is more than `2`, then `speeds` will be modified according to the minimum logic applied in each iteration.

**Output State:** 
- If `t` is `2`, then `speeds` will remain as `[v_1, v_2]`.
- If `t` is greater than `2`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` will be calculated based on the defined loop logic, ensuring `speeds[i]` will be bounded by the values influenced by `v_1`, `v_2`, and the increment `d`.

Thus, we can conclude: 
- `speeds[0]` is `v_1`
- `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`
- Each `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i < t` will be determined by the formula in the loop, representing a progressively updated speed value that cannot exceed `v_2`.

Output State: **`t` is between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `v_1` is between 1 and 100, `v_2` is between 1 and 100, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and for each `1 ≤ i < t`, `speeds[i]` is assigned the value `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.**
