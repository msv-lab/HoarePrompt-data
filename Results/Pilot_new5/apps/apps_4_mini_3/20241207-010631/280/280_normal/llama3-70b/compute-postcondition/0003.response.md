The variable `min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum between `v_1` and `v_2`. Since both `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100, `min_speed` will also be an integer between 1 and 100, specifically the smaller of the two values. The values of `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer from user input; `d` is an integer from user input; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`.**
