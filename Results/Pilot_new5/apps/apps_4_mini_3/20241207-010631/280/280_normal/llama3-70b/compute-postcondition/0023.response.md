The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The parameters have the following constraints: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `v_1`, `v_2` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10. The function returns different outputs based on these inputs, but the specific outputs are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` within the specified integer constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d within specified integer constraints.**
