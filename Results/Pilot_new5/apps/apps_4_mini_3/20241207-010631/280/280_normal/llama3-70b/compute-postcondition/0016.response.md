According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `i` is greater than 0. The loop starts with `i` equal to `t - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 2`, and since `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration. Thus, `i` will become `t - 3`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must still be greater than 0, which means `t - 3` must be greater than 0 or `t` must be greater than 3.

State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` remains unchanged**
