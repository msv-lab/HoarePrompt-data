Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is `t - 2`, `max_speed` remains unchanged.**
