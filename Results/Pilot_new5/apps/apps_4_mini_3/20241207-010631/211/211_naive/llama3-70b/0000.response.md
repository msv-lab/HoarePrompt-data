To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
1. We need to split an array into multiple subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero.
2. If it is impossible to do so, we need to print "NO".
3. If it is possible, we print "YES" and provide details about the subarrays.

### Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)
```

### Logic Review
1. The program computes prefix sums of the input array.
2. It checks if the total sum (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero; if so, it outputs "NO".
3. If the total sum is not zero, it prints "YES" and attempts to find subarray boundaries based on the prefix sums.

### Potential Issues
- **Handling Zero Elements**: The code primarily checks for non-zero prefix sums but does not handle the case where individual elements can be zero. For example, if the array contains a single zero (like `[0]`), the program correctly outputs "NO". However, for arrays like `[1, -1, 0]`, the total sum is zero, but it could potentially be split into subarrays like `[1]` and `[-1]`.
- **Subarray Formation Logic**: The loop that prints the boundaries does not currently account for cases where an entire subarray might end up being zero in a different arrangement of non-zero prefixes.

### Example Case to Consider
Consider the input:
```
3
1 -1 0
```
- The total sum of the array is `0`, so the output should be "NO".
- However, if we had an input like:
```
4
1 -1 2 -2
```
- The total sum is also `0`, but it can be split as follows:
  - `[1]` and `[-1, 2, -2]` which also has a valid split.

The logic does not account for cases where the total could be zero but can still be split. Therefore, this program could incorrectly report a "YES" when it shouldn't.

### Final Conclusion
The program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly, particularly regarding the formation of subarrays based on prefix sums. 

Correctness: **False**.
