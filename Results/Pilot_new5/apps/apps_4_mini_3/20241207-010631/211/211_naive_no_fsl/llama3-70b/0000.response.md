Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all subarrays have a non-zero sum.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 3 -6
```

In this situation, the prefix sums computed would be:

- `prefix_sum[1] = 1`
- `prefix_sum[2] = 3`
- `prefix_sum[3] = 6`
- `prefix_sum[4] = 0`
- `prefix_sum[5] = 0`

Here, the sum of the entire array is zero, but the program finds that `prefix_sum[4]` is also zero, leading to incorrect subarray partitions being generated. The program would output "YES" and print subarrays that do not satisfy the requirement of having a non-zero sum. Specifically, it may partition the array in such a way that one of the subarrays sums to zero, violating the requirement.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all resulting subarrays formed from the original array have a non-zero sum for all possible input cases.
