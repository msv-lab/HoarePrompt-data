Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`, for `i` from 0 to `n`, and `A` is a list of `n` integers with `n` between 1 and 100. If the sum of all elements in `A` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is equal to the number of valid `r` values that satisfy the condition, `l` is equal to the last valid `r`, and `r` is equal to `n`.***
