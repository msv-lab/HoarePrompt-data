Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0. If the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is set to 2, `l` remains unchanged at 1, `r` remains unchanged at 1, and the output is 1 1 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
