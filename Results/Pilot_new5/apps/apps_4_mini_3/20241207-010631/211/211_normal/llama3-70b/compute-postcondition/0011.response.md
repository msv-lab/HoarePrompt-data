The code prints 'NO', which means no variables are changed in the current state. The values of `prefix_sum` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is equal to a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`, for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is between 1 and 100, the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0 and 'NO' is printed.**
