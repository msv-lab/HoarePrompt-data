The variable `A` is assigned a new list created by taking input from the user, which is split into strings, then converted into integers. Since `n` is given as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list `A` will contain exactly `n` integers based on the input provided. The existing value of `A` is replaced by the new list created from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of n integers derived from input.**
