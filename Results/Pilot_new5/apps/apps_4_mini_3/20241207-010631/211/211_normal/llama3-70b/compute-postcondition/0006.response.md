The line of code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]` updates the value of `prefix_sum` at index `i + 1` based on the previous value of `prefix_sum` at index `i`, adding the value of `A` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 1, this means we are calculating `prefix_sum[2]` using the value of `prefix_sum[1]` and the element `A[1]`. 

From the initial state, we know that:
- `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + A[0]`
- Therefore, `prefix_sum[2]` will be equal to `(prefix_sum[0] + A[0]) + A[1]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of n integers, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + A[0]`, and `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + A[0] + A[1]`.**
