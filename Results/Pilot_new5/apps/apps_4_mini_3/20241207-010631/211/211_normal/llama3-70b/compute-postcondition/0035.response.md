The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `A`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `A` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is in the range of -1000 to 1000. 

The function output is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the provided information. Therefore, we will describe the parameters and their constraints but will not include a return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a parameter A, which is a list of n integers (each integer in the range of -1000 to 1000).**
