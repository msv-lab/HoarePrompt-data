The code provided prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `n` is an integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1.

1. The value of `i` is 1.
2. The value of `n` is greater than 1.

The expression `i + 2` evaluates to `1 + 2`, which is `3`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `3` followed by the value of `n`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, "YES" has been printed, and '2' has been printed; the output is '3 n'.**
