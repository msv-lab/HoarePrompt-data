The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, printed output is '4 n' where n is the value of n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
