According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.

After the last iteration, `i` was 0. Thus, for the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Additionally, since we need the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than `i`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1**
