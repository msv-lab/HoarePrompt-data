Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, and `i` is 1. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, then "YES" and '2' have been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider.***
