The code prints the integer `2`. The values of the variables do not change, and the state of the program remains consistent with the initial conditions. The output does not affect the variable values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, and `i` is 2. A value `2` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, and the value `2` has been printed.**
