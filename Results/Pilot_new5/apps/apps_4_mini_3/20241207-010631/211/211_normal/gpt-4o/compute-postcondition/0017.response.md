The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string "YES". The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not modify any of these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has printed "YES", but all other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, and "YES" has been printed.**
