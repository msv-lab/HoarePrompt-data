The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the calculation results in `0 + 1 = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `A` (A[0]) is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, and '1 1' has been printed.**
