The code prints '1' followed by the value of `n`. The variables `total_sum` and `A` are not modified by this code, and their states remain valid. The output does not affect any of the variable values but simply generates output based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`, the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0, and the output is '1' followed by the value of `n`.**
