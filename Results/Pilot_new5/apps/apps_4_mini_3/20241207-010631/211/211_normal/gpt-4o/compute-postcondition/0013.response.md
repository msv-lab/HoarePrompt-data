The code executes a print statement that outputs the values of the expressions `i + 2` and `n`. The current value of `i` is `0`, and `n` is an input integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). 

Calculating the result of `i + 2`: 
- Since `i` is `0`, `i + 2` equals `2`.

Thus, the output will be `2` for `i + 2`, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and they remain as follows:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `A` is a list of `n` integers
- `total_sum` is equal to `0`
- `i` is `0`
- The first element of `A` (A[0]) is not `0`
- 'YES' has been printed
- '1 1' has been printed

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `A` (A[0]) is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1 1' has been printed. The output printed is '2 n'.**
