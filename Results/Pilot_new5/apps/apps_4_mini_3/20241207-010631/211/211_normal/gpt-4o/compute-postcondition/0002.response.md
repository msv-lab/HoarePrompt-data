The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `A`. Given that `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 100 and that each integer `a_i` in the list `A` satisfies the condition -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3, `total_sum` will be calculated as the sum of `n` integers, each within that specified range. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3, and `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`.**
