The code snippet `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans` but does not change any variables or their values. The initial state indicates that `ans` is the number of distinct consecutive characters in `s`, and it also states that if `n` is less than or equal to 1, then `ans` is set to 1. Since there's no modification of variables happening in the provided code, only the output of `ans` will take place.

Output State: **`ans` is the number of distinct consecutive characters in `s`, and if `n` is less than or equal to 1, then `ans` is 1.**
