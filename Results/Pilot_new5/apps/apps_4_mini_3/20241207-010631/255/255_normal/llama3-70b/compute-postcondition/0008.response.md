The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Before this operation, `ans` was either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison of the characters at indices `i` and `i-1` of the string `s`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and the status of `s` and `n` also remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the user-entered string, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `ans`.**
