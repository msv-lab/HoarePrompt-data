The program provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string `s` by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters.

### Explanation of the Program:
1. The program defines a function that reads an integer `n` and a string `s`.

2. It initializes a counter `ans` to 1, which is intended to count the number of distinct consecutive characters in `s`.

3. A loop iterates through the string `s`, incrementing `ans` whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. 

4. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Reasoning for Incorrectness:
- The program counts the number of transitions between distinct characters instead of calculating the minimum operations required to delete the entire string by removing contiguous equal characters.
- The problem requires determining how many separate operations are needed to completely remove the string, which may not directly relate to the number of distinct characters or their transitions.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
aaaab
```
The expected output (minimum operations to remove the string) is 2 (removing "aaaa" and then "b"). However, the program would output `2`, corresponding to the transitions between 'a' and 'b', but it does not correctly represent the minimum operations needed to delete the whole string.

In another scenario, the string:
```
7
abababa
```
The expected output is 4 (removing "a", "b", "a", "b", "a"). The program would give an output of 6, counting all transitions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as it focuses on counting transitions rather than properly calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string according to the described rules.

Correctness: **False**
