The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string, which is expected to be of length `n` and consists of lowercase Latin letters. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it reflects the length of `s` and the conditions on `n` (1 <= n <= 500) still hold. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the user's input (1 <= n <= 500); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user's input (1 <= n <= 500); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
