The variable `operations` is assigned the value of `1`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the user's input (1 <= n <= 500); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `operations` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user's input (1 <= n <= 500); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `operations` is 1.**
