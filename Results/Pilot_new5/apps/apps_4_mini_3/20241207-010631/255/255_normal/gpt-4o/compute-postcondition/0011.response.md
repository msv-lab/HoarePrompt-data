`operations` is incremented by 1. The value of `operations` was initially 3, so after the increment, `operations` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged in their states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 4, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 4, `i` is 2**
