To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both closely.

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string. The operations allow deleting contiguous substrings composed of the same character.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program initializes `ans` to 1, which assumes at least one operation is needed.
2. It iterates through the string `s` from the second character to the end.
3. For every character that differs from the previous character, it increments the count (`ans`).

### Issues with the Program:
The program counts transitions between different characters, but it does not correctly account for the operations required to delete contiguous substrings of the same character.

#### Counterexample:
Let's take the string `s = "aaabbb"`:
- For this input, the correct operation count should be **2**: 
  - You can remove all `aaa` in one operation and then all `bbb` in another operation.
- However, the program will count transitions and produce `4`:
  - It sees `aaa` as one block and `bbb` as another, thus producing `ans = 2` at the end after counting transitions.

Another example:
- For `s = "aabbcc"`, the program will return `5` (as there are 5 transitions), but the minimum operations should be `3` (remove `aa`, then `bb`, then `cc`).

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the function does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential cases, particularly when it miscounts the necessary operations based on the transitions of characters rather than the groups of identical characters.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**.
