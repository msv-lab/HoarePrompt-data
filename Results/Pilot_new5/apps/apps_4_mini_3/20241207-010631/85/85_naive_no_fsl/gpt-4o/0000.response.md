Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for all cases regarding the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

1. The logic used to determine `max_9s` only considers the number of trailing zeros in `(n + 1)`, which is incorrect. The maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of two shovel costs is determined by finding pairs `(i, n - i)` where their sum ends with the desired number of nines.
   
2. For example, if `n = 50`, the maximum sum that ends with two trailing nines is 99, resulting from the pair (49, 50). However, the code does not calculate the pairs correctly, particularly for `n` values that might not be close to a multiple of 10.

3. Another issue arises when attempting to verify edge cases. For instance, if `n = 2`, the expected output should be `0` since the only pair (1, 2) sums to `3`, which does not end with any nines.

Thus, the code fails to correctly compute the number of valid pairs, and as such, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements.
