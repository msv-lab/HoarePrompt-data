According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `(n + 1) % 10` must equal 0, which means that `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is either 0 or 1. If `n` is 0, then `(0 + 1) % 10` equals 1 (not a multiple of 10), so the loop cannot execute again. If `n` is 1, then `(1 + 1) % 10` equals 2 (also not a multiple of 10), so the loop also cannot execute again. 

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be 8 (which makes `n + 1` equal to 9). No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` must be 8, `max_9s` is 1**
