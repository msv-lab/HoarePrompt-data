The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division by 10. Since it is stated that `n` must be at least 9, the possible values for `n` could be 9 or greater. After performing `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` will be `n // 10`, which reduces `n` to either `0` or `1`, depending on its initial value. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1; `max_9s` is 1**
