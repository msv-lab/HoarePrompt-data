The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the specified constraints, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no parameters being passed to the function, we cannot determine any specific behavior or output based on `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined in terms of input parameters and return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has no defined return value based on the constraints provided.**
