According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` must evaluate to true for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. 

Calculating `(n + 1) % 10` with `n` being 0 gives us: 
- `(0 + 1) % 10 = 1 % 10`, which equals 1, therefore the condition evaluates to false. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must evaluate to true. This means `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. The smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n + 1` (which is currently 1) is 10. Thus, we can adjust `n` to be 9 (since `9 + 1 = 10`, which is a multiple of 10). 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
