The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. There is no further information provided about the output or the functionality of the function. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value or the specific behavior of the function based solely on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The return value or functionality cannot be determined from the provided information.**
