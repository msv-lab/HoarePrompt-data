The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it is updated by adding 1 to it. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is the next value after incrementing by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
