The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 2. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 1, so after executing `n //= 2`, `n` will now be less than or equal to `n // 2`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged since the code provided does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is now equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is now equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
