The values of `h` and `n` are assigned from the input, which will be converted to integers. The initial conditions specify that `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h. Since the exact input values are not provided, `h` will now hold an input integer value from 1 to 50, and `n` will hold an input integer value from 1 to 2^h.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h**
