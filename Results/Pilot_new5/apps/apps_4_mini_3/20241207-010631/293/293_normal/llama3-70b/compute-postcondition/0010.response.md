The expression `ans += n // 2 - 1` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the value of `n // 2 - 1` to it. The variable `n` must be greater than 2, so `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, the value being added to `ans` will be at least 0 (when `n` is 3) and will change depending on the specific value of `n`. The variable `h` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**
