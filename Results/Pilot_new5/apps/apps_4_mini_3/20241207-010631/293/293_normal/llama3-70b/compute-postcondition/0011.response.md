The variable `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to its current value. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will always yield an integer value of at least 1 (if n is 3) and no more than 25 (if n is 50). The variable `h` remains unchanged as it only provides constraints on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` becomes `ans + n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is `ans + n // 2`**
