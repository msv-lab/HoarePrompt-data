The `print(ans)` statement outputs the current value of `ans`, but does not alter any variable or its state. The value of `n` remains 1, and `ans` retains its previously calculated value based on the iterations concerning whether `n` is even or odd. Since no value is returned, we only state that `ans` has been printed. 

Output State: **`n` is 1, `ans` is the total accumulated from the initial value of `n` based on its even or odd nature during the iterations, and `ans` has been printed.**
