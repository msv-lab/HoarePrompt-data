The integer `n` is halved using the `//` operator which performs integer division. Since the initial condition states that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the new value of `n` will be at least 2. The conditions regarding `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this specific operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `ans` is updated based on the initial value of `n`.**
