The variable `visited_count` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `visited_count` while preserving the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 0**
