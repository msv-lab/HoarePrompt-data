The value of `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`. The previous value of `current_node` is not specified directly, but it is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `direction`, which comes from the second character in the `path`. Therefore, if `current_node` was 1, it becomes `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`, and if it was 2, it becomes `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`. Consequently, `current_node` can either be 3 or 5 depending on its initial value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 2 characters; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is either 3 or 5; `direction` is the second character in `path`.**
