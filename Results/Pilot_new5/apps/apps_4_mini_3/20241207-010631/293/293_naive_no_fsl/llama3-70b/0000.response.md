To determine the correctness of the provided program that simulates Amr's navigation through a binary tree to find the exit, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()`.

The goal is to find how many nodes Amr visits before reaching the exit node in a binary tree of height `h`, where the exit node is designated by `n`.

### Breakdown of the provided code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads two integers `h` and `n`.

2. **Node Counting Logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to zero. This variable is supposed to keep track of the number of nodes visited.
   - The while loop continues until `n` becomes 1 (i.e., until we reach the root).
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` is even, it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans`.
     - If `n` is odd, it adds `n // 2` to `ans`.
     - Then it halves `n` (using integer division).

3. **Final Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

The code intends to calculate the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit. However, the logic used to update `ans` is not in accordance with the game rules outlined in the problem description. 

### Potential Issues:

1. **Incorrect Node Counting:**
   - The way `ans` is incremented does not directly correspond to the paths taken by Amr based on the "LRLRLR..." sequence. The operation `n // 2 - 1` for even `n` and `n // 2` for odd `n` does not correctly reflect the actual number of nodes visited based on how Amr would navigate through the tree.
   
2. **Sample Case Analysis:**
   - For example, take `h = 2` and `n = 3`. The expected output is `5`, as Amr would visit the nodes in the order of visiting the root (1), left child (2), then right child (3), and since 3 is the exit node, he visits 5 nodes: (1, 2, 4, 5, 3). However, the current logic fails to account for the correct movement and node count based on commands 'L' and 'R'.

3. **Inadequate Handling of Leaf Nodes:**
   - The exit logic does not consider if Amr reaches a leaf but is not yet at the exit, which could potentially lead to undercounting or miscounting nodes visited.

### Conclusion:

Given the flaws in the logic of counting nodes visited based on the design of the binary tree and the rules of movement by Amr, the code does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description. 

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
