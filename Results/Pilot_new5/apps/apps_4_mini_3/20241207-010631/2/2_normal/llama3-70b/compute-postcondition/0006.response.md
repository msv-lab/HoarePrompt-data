`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. Since the current value of `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` will now be equal to `digit_sum`, which is 1. The values of `x`, `max_num`, `i`, and `digit_sum` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
