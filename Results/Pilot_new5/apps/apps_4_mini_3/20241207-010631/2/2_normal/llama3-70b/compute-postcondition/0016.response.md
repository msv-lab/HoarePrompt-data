The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The previous value of `max_sum` was 2, and the value of `digit_sum` is 3. Thus, after execution, `max_sum` will be updated to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
