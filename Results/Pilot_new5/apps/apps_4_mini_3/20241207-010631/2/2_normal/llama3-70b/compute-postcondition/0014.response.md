According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the current value of `i`. The loop is designed to iterate from `1` to `x`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. Since `x` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 2. In this case, `x` must remain at least 3 or higher for the loop to continue.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, and `digit_sum` is 2**.
