The variable `i` is assigned the value 1 initially. The code calculates `digit_sum` as the sum of the digits of `i`, which is the integer 1. Therefore, `digit_sum` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
