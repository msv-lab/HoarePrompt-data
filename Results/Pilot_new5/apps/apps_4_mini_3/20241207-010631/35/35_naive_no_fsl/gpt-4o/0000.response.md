To verify the correctness of the program against the given problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the underlying logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Each piece of each cake must be put on some plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate can contain pieces of both cakes.
4. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on the plate (denoted as x).

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers: `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake).
   
2. **Function `func_1(n, a, b)`**: 
   - It initializes a binary search range from `1` to `min(a, b) + 1`. 
   - Within the binary search, it calculates the middle value `mid` and checks if the cakes can be distributed such that each plate has at least `mid` pieces using the helper function `can_distribute(x)`.

3. **Function `can_distribute(x)`**:
   - It checks if the total number of plates can be filled by pieces from the two cakes given the constraint `x`.
   - The logic checks if the total number of complete distributions of both cakes can meet or exceed `n`.

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider edge cases:
- When `n` is exactly equal to `a + b`, the maximum pieces that can be placed on each plate would be either `1` or potentially higher, depending on the distribution.
- If `a` or `b` is `0`, which cannot happen due to the problem constraints (1 â‰¤ a, b), but checking for smaller `n` values may lead to misallocations.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. Input: `5 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The function should distribute as follows: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` which is achievable.

2. Input: `4 7 10`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The function should be able to distribute as `[3, 4]` from the first cake and `[5, 5]` from the second cake, which is achievable.

3. Edge Case Input: `5 5 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Check if the distribution can be `[2, 2, 1, 0, 0]` (this is not valid as per the plate condition, thus it must check correctly to limit). The function should return `2`, but whether it does so needs verification.

### Conclusion:
To sum up, the implementation performs binary search for the maximum possible `x` value. However, it misses out on certain distributions and does not explicitly handle scenarios when the number of required plates exceeds the available pieces from either cake for higher `mid` values.

**Final Verdict**: The correctness fails due to potential misgrouping and not handling certain edge cases appropriately. The program does not guarantee correct results for all cases described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**.
