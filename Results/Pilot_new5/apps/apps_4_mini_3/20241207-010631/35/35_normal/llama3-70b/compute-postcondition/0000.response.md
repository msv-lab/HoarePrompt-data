In the given code, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values from the input. The input is split into three integers which are then mapped to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The preconditions state the ranges for `n`, `a`, and `b`. After executing the code, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values provided through input.

Since the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not defined in the prompt, we can only specify that they are now integers within the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (value from input), `a` is an integer (value from input), `b` is an integer (value from input)**
