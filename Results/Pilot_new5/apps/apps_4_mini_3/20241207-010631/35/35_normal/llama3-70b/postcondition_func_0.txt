The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`) and determines the maximum integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and also meets the condition `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`. The function prints this maximum valid value of `x`. If no valid value is found, it continues decrementing `x` until it reaches an invalid state. There is no explicit handling for cases where `x` could become negative, which could lead to an infinite loop if not properly bounded.
