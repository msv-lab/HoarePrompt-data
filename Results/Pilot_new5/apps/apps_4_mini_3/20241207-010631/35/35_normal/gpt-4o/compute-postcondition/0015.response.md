`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `low` will now be updated to a value that is one greater than the previous value of `mid`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `high`, and `mid`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `high` is greater than `low`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` and `low` is now `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `high` is greater than `low`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `low` is now `mid + 1`.**
