To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the code against the problem description and the provided annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: Three integers: `n` (plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake).
2. **Output**: The maximum number `x` such that all plates can have at least `x` pieces under the constraints:
   - Each piece of each cake is put on some plate.
   - Each plate contains at least one piece of cake.
   - No plate contains pieces from both cakes.

### Code Functionality Overview:
- **Function `func_1(n, a, b)`**: 
  - It uses binary search to determine the maximum minimum number of pieces (`x`) that can be distributed to the plates.
  - It checks if a certain number of pieces `x` can be distributed to the plates using the helper function `can_distribute(x)`.

- **Function `can_distribute(x)`**:
  - It checks if the total number of pieces from both cakes can satisfy the requirement that each of the `n` plates receives at least `x` pieces.

### Key Observations:
1. The binary search is set from `1` to `min(a, b) + 1`, which means it is finding the maximum minimum pieces that can be distributed from both cakes.
2. The function `can_distribute(x)` returns whether `a // x + b // x >= n`, which checks whether we can get enough plates by dividing the available pieces by `x`.

### Edge Cases:
- When `a + b < n`, it is impossible to distribute at least one piece to each plate, but since the problem guarantees `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, we do not have to worry about this case.
- The logic assumes that pieces can be distributed evenly, but it does not check whether `x` can actually be achieved with the given constraints of having separate distribution for each cake.

#### Example Analysis:
- For `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, the output is `1`, which is correct because:
  - You can have 5 plates, and every plate can get at least 1 piece from any of the cakes.
  
- For `n = 4`, `a = 7`, `b = 10`, the output is `3`, which is also correct since:
  - You can distribute like this: 2 plates with 3 pieces from one cake, and 2 plates with 5 pieces from the other.

### Problem Identification:
The issue lies in the fact that the binary search does not consider that pieces from one cake cannot be mixed with pieces from another cake on the same plate. The current logic can misleadingly suggest that we can reach the desired distribution without accounting for how many separate distributions (one for each cake) can actually be made. 

For instance, if `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `n = 5`, the function might suggest that each plate can have at least `3` pieces (which is incorrect if each cake must be kept separate). Thus it could end up returning an invalid result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account properly for the constraints regarding the separation of cake pieces on plates. Consequently, based on the analysis and edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
