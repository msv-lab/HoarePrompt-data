The code initializes an empty list `cycle`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list.**
