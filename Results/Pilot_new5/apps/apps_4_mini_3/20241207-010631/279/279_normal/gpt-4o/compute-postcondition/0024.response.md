The code `cycles.append(cycle)` adds the current `cycle` (a list of indices visited during the loop) to the `cycles` list. The `visited` list remains unchanged, as does the value of `x`, which points to an index already marked as `True`. The `cycles` list will now contain one additional element, which is the `cycle` that was being tracked.

Output State: **`visited` is a list of length `n` with `True` at the indices corresponding to all elements of the cycle detected; `cycles` now contains the `cycle`; `cycle` contains the indices visited during the loop; `x` is the first index that caused the loop to exit.**
