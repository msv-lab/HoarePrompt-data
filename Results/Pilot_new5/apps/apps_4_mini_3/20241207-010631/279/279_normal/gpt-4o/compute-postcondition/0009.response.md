The variable `cycle` is initialized as an empty list. This changes the state of `cycle` from being undefined to being an empty list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, and `cycle` is an empty list.**
