The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since the values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1.**
