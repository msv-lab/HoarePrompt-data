The variable `x` is set to 1, as determined by the expression `x = p[2] - 1`. The code `visited[x] = True` then sets the value at index 1 of the `visited` list to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[2]` is `True`, `visited[1]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` now contains 2, `x` is 1**
