The variable `x` is assigned the value `p[x] - 1`. Since `x` is at least 3, we know that `p[x]` is an integer (as `p` is a list of integers). The value of `x` will therefore change based on the value of `p[x]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `p` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `visited[2]` is True; `visited[1]` is True; `visited[x]` is True for `x >= 3; `cycles` is an empty list; `cycle` now contains 2, 1, and `x`; `x` is now equal to `p[x] - 1`.**
