Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones with length `n`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and counts how many of those cycles do not have any reverse components (where all corresponding values in `b` are 0). It prints `0` if there is exactly one cycle; otherwise, it prints the count of cycles without reverse components if this count is greater than 0, or `1` if there are no such cycles. **
