The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The initial state indicates that `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1`. Since `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, the value of `p[0]` is the first integer from that list. Thus, `x` will also be an integer. The list `cycle` originally contains the value `0`, and after executing the code, `x` will be added to `cycle`.

Therefore, the new state of `cycle` will include the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` has value `True` at index `x`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing the values `0` and `x`, `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1`**.
