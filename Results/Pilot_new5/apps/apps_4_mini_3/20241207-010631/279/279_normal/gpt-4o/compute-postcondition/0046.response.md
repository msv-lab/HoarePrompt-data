The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list with all values set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 2**
