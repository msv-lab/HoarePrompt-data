The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are still valid, with the understanding that `n` must now hold the new integer value provided by the user. The lists `p` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`.**
