The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The value of `ans` will now be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with length `n`; `i` is the incremented value (i + 1) such that `i + 1` is less than `n`; `ans` is increased by 1.**
