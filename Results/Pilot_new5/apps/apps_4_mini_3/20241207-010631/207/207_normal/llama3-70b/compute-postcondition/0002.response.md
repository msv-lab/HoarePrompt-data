The value of `dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros initially, so after this assignment, `dp[0]` will be `1` while the rest of the elements (from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]`) will remain `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `dp` is a list where `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are still zeros.**
