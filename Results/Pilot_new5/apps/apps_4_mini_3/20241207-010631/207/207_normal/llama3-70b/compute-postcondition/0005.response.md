The line of code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the `dp` list at the index `i + a` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. By the initial state, we know that `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are zeros. Since `i` is 0, the addition will occur at index `a`, and we will be adding `dp[0]` (which is 1) to `dp[a]`.

The other variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged; they still hold their respective values from the initial state.

Thus, after executing the code, the value at index `dp[a]` will become 1. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[a] = 1`, `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are still zeros, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`.**
