To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap
1. The frog starts at position 0.
2. It can jump to position \( k + a \) or \( k - b \) from position \( k \).
3. The goal is to compute \( f(x) \), which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach in the interval \([0, x]\).
4. Finally, we need to compute the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \).

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `dp` of size \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0]` set to 1, which indicates that the frog is at position 0.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).
   - It attempts to jump to \( i + a \) and add the value of `dp[i]` to `dp[i + a]`, which is correct if \( i + a \leq m \).
   - It also attempts to jump back to \( i - b \) and adds `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, which is incorrect because it modifies the current position based on a prior position that shouldn't be updated at this point in the iteration.

3. **Final Calculation**: The program computes the sum of the `dp` array, which represents the number of ways to reach each position.

### Issues with the Program
- The main issue arises from the following line:
  ```python
  dp[i] += dp[i - b]
  ```
  This line modifies `dp[i]` based on `dp[i - b]`, which isn't aligned with the requirement to count distinct integers reachable by the frog. The logic should instead focus on accumulating unique reachable positions instead of counting paths.

- The program does not correctly compute \( f(i) \) as defined in the problem description. It incorrectly updates the `dp` array in a way that can lead to incorrect counts of reachable integers.

### Conclusion
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly due to the flawed logic in the dynamic programming update step. 

Thus, the final assessment of correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
