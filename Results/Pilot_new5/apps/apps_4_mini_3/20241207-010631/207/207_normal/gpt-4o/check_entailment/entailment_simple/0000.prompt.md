You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x_old` and `y_old`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x_old` and `y_old`, where `y` is 0 and `x` holds that GCD value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, and b is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 with parameters (m // g), (a // g), and (b // g), all multiplied by g, where g is the output of func_1(a, b) and g is not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1, which is the output of `func_1(a, b)`
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the result of (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m < k, and k = a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of sum_k and sum_m, where sum_k is equal to k times (k + 1) divided by 2, and sum_m is equal to m times (m + 1) divided by 2 minus k times (k - 1) divided by 2.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
