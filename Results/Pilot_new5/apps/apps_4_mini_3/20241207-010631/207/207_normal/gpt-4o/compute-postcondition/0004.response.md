The variable `k` is assigned the value of `a + b - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` are both positive integers within the given ranges, so `k` will also be a positive integer. The states of the other variables, `m` and `g`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
