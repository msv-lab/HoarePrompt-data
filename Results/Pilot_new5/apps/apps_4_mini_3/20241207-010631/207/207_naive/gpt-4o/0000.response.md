To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The frog can jump to position `k + a` or `k - b`. The function `f(x)` calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without jumping outside the interval `[0, x]`. The final output is the sum of `f(i)` for all integers from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

- `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is useful because if `gcd(a, b) != 1`, the count of reachable positions can be scaled down by this factor.
- The main functionality is handled by `func_2`, which distinguishes between cases where the maximum position `m` is less than `a + b - 1` and greater than or equal to that value. It calculates the number of distinct positions reachable based on the value of `m` and the jumps `a` and `b`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input Edge Case:** For the smallest input values, `m = 1, a = 1, b = 1`. The expected output should be calculated. The reachable positions from `0` in this case would be `0` and `1`, thus `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 2`, summing up gives `3`. However, with these inputs, the function might need to be validated to ensure it encompasses all reachable positions accurately.
   
2. **Large m with Small Jumps:** For large `m` values like `m = 10^9`, with small `a` and large `b`, we expect the program to handle this efficiently and accurately.

3. **No Jumps Possible:** Test cases such as `m = 10, a = 10, b = 10` where the frog cannot jump backward would help to validate if `f(x)` results in the correct count of reachable integers.

4. **Jumps Resulting in Repetitions:** Cases where `a` and `b` share common factors and may lead to overlapping reachable integers should also be examined.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and considering edge cases, there is a concern about how the program handles some scenarios, particularly when `m < a + b - 1`. 

**Correctness:** **False**. 

**Reasoning:** There may be cases where the program inaccurately counts the number of reachable integers or fails to account for all possible outcomes in cases where `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, especially since the logic may not correctly handle scenarios of non-reachability or miscounts when jumps overlap or exceed bounds. An explicit test case for a minimal boundary condition would illustrate potential inaccuracies in counting the reachable positions. For instance, `m = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1` or `m = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 10`.
