The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the internal state or global variables which might not be described in this context. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value. As a result, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly defined without additional information regarding its behavior or output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
