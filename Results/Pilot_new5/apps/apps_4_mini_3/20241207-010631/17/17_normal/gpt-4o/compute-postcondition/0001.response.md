`cnt2` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables (`cnt_1`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is a non-negative integer, and `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer**
