The code assigns new values to `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` by taking input values and converting them to integers. The initial state indicates that `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to \(10^9\). The new values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` will depend on the user input. Therefore, the updated output state will reflect the new values of the variables.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned values from user input converted to integers.**
