The code assigns the value of `max_lemons` to the minimum of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since all three variables are input positive integers, we will derive `max_lemons` based on the given values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

- `a` is an input positive integer.
- `b // 2` will be half of the input positive integer `b`.
- `c // 4` will be one-fourth of the input positive integer `c`.

Therefore, `max_lemons` is calculated as the smallest of these three values.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is equal to min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`)**
