The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is computed as `max_lemons * 7`. The value of `max_lemons` is determined by `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are input positive integers, and `total_fruits` is directly dependent on the calculated value of `max_lemons`. 

Since all variables retain their initial conditions and only the `total_fruits` variable will be explicitly calculated, we can state the output.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`, and the value of `total_fruits` is printed.**
