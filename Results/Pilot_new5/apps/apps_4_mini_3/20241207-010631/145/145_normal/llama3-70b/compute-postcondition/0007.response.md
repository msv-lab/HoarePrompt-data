According to the code, the loop iterates over each `digit` in the `ticket` string. The variables that are important here are `ticket`, `digit`, and the loop is guaranteed to execute as long as `ticket` is not empty.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `ticket` is a string of digits with length `n` where `2 <= n <= 100`. This assures us that there is at least one digit present, which allows the loop to execute. The loop will start with the first `digit` being the first character of `ticket`. The `curr_sum` and `segments` variables do not impact the execution of the loop but may be relevant for the loop's body.

Therefore, to enable the loop to execute, we do not need to make any adjustments to the existing states.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0**
