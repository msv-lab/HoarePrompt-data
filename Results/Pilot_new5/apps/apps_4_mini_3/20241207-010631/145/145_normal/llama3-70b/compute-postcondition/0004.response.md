The value of `target_sum` is assigned the value of `total_sum` divided by 2. Since `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` will also be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length n (2 <= n <= 100), each digit is an integer between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length n (2 <= n <= 100), each digit is an integer between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2.**
