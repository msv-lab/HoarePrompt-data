Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `curr_sum` is the previous `curr_sum` plus the integer value of `digit`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` becomes 0, `segments` is increased to 3, and `digit` is the next character in the `ticket` after the last one processed.***
