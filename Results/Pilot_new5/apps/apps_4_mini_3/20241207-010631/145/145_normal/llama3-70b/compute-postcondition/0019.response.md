The value of `curr_sum` is incremented by `digit`, which is the next character in the `ticket` after the last one processed. The variable `curr_sum` changes, while `ticket`, `segments`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `curr_sum` will be the previous value plus the integer value of `digit`. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `curr_sum` is an integer value equal to the previous `curr_sum` plus the integer value of `digit`, `segments` is 2, `digit` is the next character in the `ticket` after the last one processed.**
