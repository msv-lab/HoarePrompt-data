The provided annotated program implements the logic required to determine whether a given ticket (string of digits) can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The analysis of the code against the problem description follows.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the digits of the ticket. It converts the input string of digits into a list of integers, which matches the problem description.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` first calculates the total sum of the digits. If the sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because an odd total sum cannot be divided into two equal integer segments.
   - If the total sum is even, the function calculates the `target_sum` as half of the total sum. It then iterates through the list of digits accumulating a `curr_sum`.
   - Whenever `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it increments the segments count and resets `curr_sum`. This allows tracking how many segments have been found that equal `target_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns `True` if at least two segments with equal sums have been found, which fulfills the requirement outlined in the problem description.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles all required conditions: checking for total sum parity, tracking segments, and ensuring at least two segments are found with the required sum.
   - It adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 9).

Since the program correctly fulfills all the conditions laid out in the problem description for all valid cases, the correctness of the program can be concluded.

Correctness: **True** 

The program meets the problem requirements by accurately determining if the ticket can be segmented into two or more parts with equal sums, adhering to all specified conditions.
