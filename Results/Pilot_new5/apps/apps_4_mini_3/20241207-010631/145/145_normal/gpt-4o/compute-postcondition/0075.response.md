Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100) and a string `ticket` consisting of n digits (characters from '0' to '9'). It attempts to partition the digits of `ticket` into segments such that each segment has the same sum equal to the sum of the first segment of a specified length. If it can form more than one such segment without any remaining digits, it returns 'YES'. If no valid segmentation is found after testing all possible segment lengths, it returns 'NO'.**
