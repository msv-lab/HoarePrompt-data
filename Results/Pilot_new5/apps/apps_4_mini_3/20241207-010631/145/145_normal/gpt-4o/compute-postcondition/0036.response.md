The value of `current_sum` is assigned to be 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was `current_sum + int(ticket[1])`, but since we are now resetting it to 0, we lose that previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 1, `i` is 1**
