The code snippet assigns `0` to `current_sum`. The previous value of `current_sum` was `0 + int(ticket[2])`, but after the assignment, `current_sum` is explicitly set to `0`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `segment_count` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `segment_count` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**.
