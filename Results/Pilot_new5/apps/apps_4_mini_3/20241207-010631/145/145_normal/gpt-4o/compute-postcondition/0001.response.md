The function `segment_sum` accepts three parameters: a string `ticket` consisting of digits, and two integers `start` and `end`. The string `ticket` has a length `n` that satisfies the constraint 2 <= n <= 100, where each character in the string represents a non-negative integer (0 to 9). The integers `start` and `end` are non-negative and satisfy the constraint 0 <= start <= end < n. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. Therefore, the functionality of the function segment_sum is to accept a string of digits and two indices, and return the sum of the digits from the specified range of indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string ticket of digits and two integers start and end, and returns the sum of the digits in ticket from index start to index end, inclusive.**
