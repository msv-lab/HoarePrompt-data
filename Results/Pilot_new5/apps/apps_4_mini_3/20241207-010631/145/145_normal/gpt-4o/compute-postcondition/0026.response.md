The value of `current_sum` is assigned the value of 0. The initial state indicates that `current_sum` was not equal to 0 before the assignment, but now it is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, but the important change is that `current_sum` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
