The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of digits in the ticket where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits that are characters from '0' to '9'. 

After executing the function body:

- In Case 1, the function returns 'YES'.
- In Case 2, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions have been met, with `segment_count` being greater than 1 and `current_sum` equal to 0.
- In Case 3, the function returns 'YES', indicating that a condition has been met, although the specifics of that condition are not detailed in the provided state.
- In Case 4, the function returns 'NO' regardless of the values of `n`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, `current_sum`, `segment_count`, and `i`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket`, and based on specific conditions, it returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluation of those conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a string ticket, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions evaluated within the function.**
