The value of `current_sum` is set to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, which is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `current_sum` while retaining the existing conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`**
