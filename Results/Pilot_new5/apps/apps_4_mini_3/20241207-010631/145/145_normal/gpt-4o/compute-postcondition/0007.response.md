The code assigns `0` to `current_sum`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, and since `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, it remains unchanged. The other variables do not change. Therefore, the output states that `current_sum` is now `0`, while `n`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.**
