`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 0, so the new value will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`**.
