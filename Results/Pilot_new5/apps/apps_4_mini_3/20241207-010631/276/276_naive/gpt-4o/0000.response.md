To determine the correctness of the provided Python program for comparing two numbers in the "golden system," let's analyze the program step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to compare two binary strings that represent numbers in the "golden system."
2. The decimal value of the binary string is computed using the formula involving \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. The program should print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller, and "=" if they are equal.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. It takes two binary strings as input.
2. It computes the decimal value of each string using the `func_1`.
3. It compares the two computed values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol.

#### `func_1` Implementation:
- It initializes a decimal value to 0.
- It iterates over the binary string and for every '1' found, it adds \( q^{(n - i - 1)} \) to the value, where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( i \) is the current index.
- This correctly implements the formula defined in the problem description for converting a binary string to its corresponding decimal value in the golden system.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not account for leading zeros in the strings correctly. For instance, the strings "0001" and "1" should be equal in value, but the current implementation will treat them as different due to their decimal values being \( q^0 = 1 \) and \( q^{3} \), respectively. In this case, it would compare "1" to a computed value that is not equal to 1.
2. **Very Large Inputs**: The program's efficiency needs to be assessed since the string length can go up to 100,000. The calculations involving powers of \( q \) for large strings could lead to performance issues or inaccuracies due to floating-point precision limits. 

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case of leading zeros and potentially has issues in terms of performance and precision with large inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.

### Counterexample:
The inputs "0001" and "1" should yield "=" but the program would incorrectly compute them as different values because it does not strip leading zeros before processing.
