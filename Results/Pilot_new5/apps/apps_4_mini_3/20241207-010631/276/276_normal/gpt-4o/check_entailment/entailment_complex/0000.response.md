Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description due to a critical issue in the handling of input strings. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to take a single string input that represents a binary number in the golden system. However, the annotated program describes the input as a tuple containing two strings, which is misleading. The function is effectively designed to compute the value for only the first string passed to it, ignoring the second string entirely. 

Moreover, the problem description requires a direct comparison of the two numbers represented by the input strings. However, the function is only designed to calculate the value of one string at a time, resulting in the loss of the ability to compare both numbers accurately. 

In essence, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to compare the two input strings as required, since it only processes one input string without considering the second. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements in all cases.
