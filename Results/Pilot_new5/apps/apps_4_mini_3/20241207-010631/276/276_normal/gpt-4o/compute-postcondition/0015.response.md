The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with the length of each string not exceeding 100000. After executing the function body, the program returns a value that is equal to the sum of `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of two binary strings and return a value based on the sum of a specific mathematical constant. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a tuple of two non-empty binary strings, and returns a value equal to the sum of q, where q is approximately 1.618033988749895.**
