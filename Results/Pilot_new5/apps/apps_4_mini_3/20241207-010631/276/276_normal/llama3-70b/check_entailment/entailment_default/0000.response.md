To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and check for potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to compare two numbers written in a "golden system" notation, which uses the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) as its base. The program should determine which of the two numbers has a larger decimal value.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads two strings representing numbers in the golden system and converts them to decimal values using the function `func_1`. This function calculates the decimal value based on the positions of the '1's in the binary-like string representation.

```python
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal
```

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not address the possibility of leading zeros in the input strings. For example:
   - Input: "0001" and "1" should be evaluated as equal, but the string "0001" would still yield a decimal value of \( q^0 = 1 \), and "1" also yields \( q^0 = 1 \), so they are handled correctly as equal. However, it's good practice to ensure such cases are considered.
   
2. **Empty Strings**: The problem description states that each string is non-empty, so we can assume that this edge case is not a concern; however, if we were to change the constraints, the code does not handle empty strings.

3. **Invalid Characters**: Although the problem states the strings consist only of '0's and '1's, the program does not check for invalid characters. If an unexpected input somehow occurs, it would lead to an error in conversion.

### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hint states that the function returns the sum of \( q^i \) for all indices `i` where the corresponding character in `s` is '1'. This matches the implementation, which correctly calculates the decimal value based on the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \).

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the code handles the expected cases according to the problem description effectively, especially considering the specifics of the golden system. The output hints align with the code's functionality. There are no examples that illustrate a failure to meet the requirements of the problem description given the constraints.

However, while the function works correctly, it is somewhat reliant on the assumption that input will always be valid (non-empty strings of '0's and '1's). Therefore, to be absolutely correct according to best practices in software engineering, the code would ideally include validation checks for input.

Nonetheless, since the correctness strictly follows the problem description as all inputs are expected to be valid according to the constraints laid out, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
