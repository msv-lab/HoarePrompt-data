Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two lines of input, each representing a number in the "golden system" (a non-empty string of '0's and '1's). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to convert the given string representation in the golden system into its corresponding decimal value using the formula specified:
   \[
   \text{decimal value} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}
   \]
   where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The program loops through the characters of the string in reverse order, calculating the decimal value correctly by only including terms where the character is '1'. This accurately reflects the conversion from the golden system to a decimal value.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal values of both inputs, the program compares them using standard comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `=`) and prints the appropriate symbol as required by the problem description.

4. **Efficiency**: The program is designed to handle input strings of length up to 100,000 efficiently. The use of a single loop to compute the decimal value ensures that the time complexity remains linear with respect to the length of the string.

Given these points, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description and correctly compares the two numbers in the golden system. Therefore, it is deemed correct.
