Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 2 elements, and `v` is the second element of the list `a`. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
