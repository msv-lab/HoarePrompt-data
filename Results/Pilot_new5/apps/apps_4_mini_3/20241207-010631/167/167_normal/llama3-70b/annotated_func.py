#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `px` is equal to `(a[n - 1] - 1) // y`, `py` is equal to `(a[n - 1] - 1) % y`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the condition that the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is satisfied for all iterations.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition involving absolute differences abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) is satisfied for all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It processes a list `a` of `n` integers, where the integers are constrained between 1 and \(10^9\), and `n` is between 1 and 200,000. The function evaluates consecutive elements in `a` to check if their transformed coordinates (`nx`, `ny`) differ from the previous coordinates (`px`, `py`) by exactly 1 in the Manhattan distance. If at any point this condition is not satisfied, it returns False. If all elements satisfy the condition, it returns True. The function does not seem to utilize the parameters `x` and `y` effectively as the list `a` is not defined within the function or as a parameter, which may indicate an incomplete implementation.
