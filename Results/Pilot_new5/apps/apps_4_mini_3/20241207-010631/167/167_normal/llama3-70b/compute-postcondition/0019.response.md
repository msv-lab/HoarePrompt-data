The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is an integer, and the parameter `y` is also an integer. The function can return different outputs based on certain conditions. Specifically, it can return `False` in three different cases, indicating that certain conditions were not met. In one case, it can return `True`, which indicates that the condition involving absolute differences is satisfied for all iterations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to evaluate the inputs `x` and `y`, returning `False` under specific conditions and `True` if the absolute difference condition is met for all iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are both integers. It returns False in three different cases, and True if certain conditions related to absolute differences are satisfied.**
