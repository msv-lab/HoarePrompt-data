The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the condition that `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, specifically when `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` (where `a > 0`) and `b` (where `b >= 0`), and return the greatest common divisor of these integers when `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of 'a' and 'b' when 'b' is 0.**
