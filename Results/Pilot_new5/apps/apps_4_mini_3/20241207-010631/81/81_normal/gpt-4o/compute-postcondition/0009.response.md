Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `r` is an integer between `l` and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `y` is an integer between `x` and 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `y`, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i`. The current values of `a` and `b` are between `l` and `r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`.***
