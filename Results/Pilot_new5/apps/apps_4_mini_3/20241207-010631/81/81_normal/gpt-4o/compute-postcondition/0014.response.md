Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `r` is an integer between `l` and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `y` is an integer between `x` and 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, and the current values of `a` and `b` are between `l` and `r` with the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` equal to `x`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is 1 and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`. Otherwise, `count` is equal to its previous value plus 2, and `a` is not equal to `b`. The current value of `z` is divisible by `i`, and `i` remains 1 throughout the execution.***
