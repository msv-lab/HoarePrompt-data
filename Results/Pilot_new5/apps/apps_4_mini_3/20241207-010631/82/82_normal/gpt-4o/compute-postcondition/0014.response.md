Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` which is less than the new value of `min_lcm`.**
