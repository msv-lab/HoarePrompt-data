The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
