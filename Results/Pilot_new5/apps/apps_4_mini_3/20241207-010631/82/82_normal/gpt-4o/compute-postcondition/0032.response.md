According to the code, the loop iterates over possible values of `k` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. If the loop is to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be incremented from its current value. Assuming the loop has executed for `k` already, the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at some value, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. Thus, the next iteration will have `k` incremented by 1, and the maximum value for `k` must still satisfy that `k` does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`**.
