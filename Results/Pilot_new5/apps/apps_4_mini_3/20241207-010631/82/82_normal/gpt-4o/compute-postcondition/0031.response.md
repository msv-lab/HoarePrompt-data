Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_k` is the candidate that results in `min_lcm` (either `k` or `diff // k`). If `diff % k != 0`, there is no else part defined, and the state of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remains unchanged.***
