According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. The value of `candidate` will take two different values: first `k` and then `diff // k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. For the loop to execute one more time, we must consider the following:

1. **First Iteration (when candidate is k)**: 
   - `candidate` is currently `k`, which is valid since `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
   
2. **Second Iteration (when candidate is diff // k)**: 
   - We need to ensure that `diff // k` is also a valid candidate, meaning it must be calculated again after `k` is incremented.
   
3. **Adjustment of `k`**:
   - After the loop completes, `k` will continue to increment in subsequent iterations. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `candidate` must be able to take both values. Since `candidate` takes the values in the order they appear in the list, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k` after the loop processes `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be adjusted to reflect the increment of `k` and accommodate the potential calculation of `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `new_a` is calculated as (a + k - 1) // k * k, `new_b` is calculated as (b + k - 1) // k * k, `current_lcm` is equal to func_2(new_a, new_b), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`**
