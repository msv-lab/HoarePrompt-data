According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the condition for the range. The loop iterates for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been incremented by 1 if the condition `diff % k == 0` was satisfied. 

Given the constraints that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, the value of `diff` is calculated as `abs(a - b)`, which is a positive integer. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. If the loop has already executed with `k` incremented by 1, then for the next iteration, `k` needs to be equal to the previous value of `k` plus 1. 

Thus, if `k` was incremented from a value less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, it must now be incremented to the next integer, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must now be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `min_lcm` retains the previous minimum least common multiple value, `min_k` retains its previous candidate value, `current_lcm` retains the last computed least common multiple value.**
