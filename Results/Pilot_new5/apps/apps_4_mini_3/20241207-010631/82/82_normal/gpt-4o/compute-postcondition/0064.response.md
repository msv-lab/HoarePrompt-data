The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is as follows, retaining all preconditions while updating the value of `min_k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (current_lcm is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
