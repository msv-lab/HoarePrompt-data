Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `min_lcm` is updated to the minimum least common multiple found during the loop iterations, `min_k` is updated to the candidate value corresponding to `min_lcm`, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple computed from the final `new_a` and `new_b` values after processing both candidates. Otherwise, no changes are made to `min_lcm`, `min_k`, or `current_lcm`.***
