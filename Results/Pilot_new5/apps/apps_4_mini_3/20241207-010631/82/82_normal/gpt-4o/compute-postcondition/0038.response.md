Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be <= int(math.sqrt(diff)), where `diff` is a positive value derived from abs(a - b); `new_a` is equal to (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `new_b` is equal to (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is equal to func_2(new_a, new_b); `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
