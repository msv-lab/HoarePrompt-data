The code computes the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Given that `a` and `b` are both integers in the range from `1` to `10^9` and are not equal, the output will be a valid positive integer representing the difference.

The variable `diff` is assigned the value `abs(a - b)`, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`**
