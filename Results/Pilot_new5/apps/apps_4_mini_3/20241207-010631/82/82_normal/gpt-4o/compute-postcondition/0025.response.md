The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of the expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is equal to `k`, we can express `new_b` as `(b + k - 1) // k * k`.

Since `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `k` is also within the range, `new_b` will be a multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, and `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`.**
