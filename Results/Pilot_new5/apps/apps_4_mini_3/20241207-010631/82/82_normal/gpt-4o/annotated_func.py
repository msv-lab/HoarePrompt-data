    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, where y is 0 and x is the GCD of x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function will return `x`, which will be equal to the GCD when the loop completes, at which point `y` will be 0. It correctly handles large integers up to \(10^9\) but does not account for cases where `x` or `y` is 0, as the GCD is typically defined for positive integers. Therefore, if either input is zero, undefined behavior may occur based on the mathematical definition of GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of x multiplied by y divided by the value of func_1(x, y), where x and y are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the result of `x` multiplied by `y` divided by the value returned by `func_1(x, y)`. The function does not handle any potential errors from `func_1`, such as a division by zero if `func_1(x, y)` returns 0.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`. If the loop executes, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated from valid candidates, and `min_k` is the candidate that resulted in `min_lcm`. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the candidate that resulted in the minimum least common multiple of new_a and new_b from valid candidates, or 0 if no loop executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns 0 if `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, finds candidates derived from the divisors of this difference, and computes the least common multiple (LCM) of adjusted versions of `a` and `b`. The function returns the candidate that produces the minimum LCM, or 0 if no valid candidates are found.
