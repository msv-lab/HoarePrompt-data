Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9, `a != b`), `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple calculated from pairs of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_k` is the candidate that produced the `min_lcm`, `new_a` is calculated based on the final candidate used in the loop, `new_b` is also based on the final candidate, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple computed by the last values of `new_a` and `new_b`. If the loop did not execute, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initial values.**
