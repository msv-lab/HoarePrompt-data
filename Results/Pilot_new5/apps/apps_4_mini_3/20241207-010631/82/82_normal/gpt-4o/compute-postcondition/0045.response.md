To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first analyze the impact of the assignment statement:

1. `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`.
2. The variables `current_lcm`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `candidate`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them.

Given that `current_lcm` is assigned a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` will now hold that same value.

Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by func_2(new_a, new_b), `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
