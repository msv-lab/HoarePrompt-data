Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `min_lcm` is updated to the minimum least common multiple found during the loop iterations, `min_k` is updated to the candidate value corresponding to `min_lcm`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple computed from the final `new_a` and `new_b` values after processing both candidates.`**
