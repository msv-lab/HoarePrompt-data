According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candidate` values that are being iterated over in the list `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, the `candidate` was one of these values, and for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to take the next value from this list.

Given that we have already processed one value from the list, the next value will be the one that follows in the iteration. Let's denote the current value of `candidate` at the end of the last iteration as either `k` or `diff // k`. After one iteration, the loop will move to the next candidate.

If `candidate` was `k` during the last iteration, then the next candidate will be `diff // k`. If `candidate` was `diff // k`, then there are no more candidates in the list, and the loop will not execute again. 

For the sake of adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we will consider the case where `candidate` was `k`, and the next candidate is `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the value assigned after processing the previous candidate, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged, candidate is `diff // k`**
