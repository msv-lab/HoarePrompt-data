Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `a` and `b` are equal. According to the problem description, when both integers are the same, the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple should be `0`. The code correctly returns `0` in that case. However, for cases where `a` and `b` are different, the logic in `func_3` attempts to minimize the least common multiple but fails to account for all possible values of `k`.

For example, let's consider the inputs `a = 10` and `b = 15`. The absolute difference `diff` is `5`. The code only checks the divisors of `5` (which are `1` and `5`). This means the function computes the least common multiple for `k = 1` and `k = 5` but does not consider `k = 0`, which is a valid candidate that should be checked because `lcm(10 + 0, 15 + 0) = lcm(10, 15) = 30`, and it might be the least common multiple.

Thus, the logic is incomplete and does not check all possible values of `k` including `0`, leading to incorrect results in cases where the minimum `k` yielding the least common multiple is less than the computed candidates. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem requirements in all cases.
