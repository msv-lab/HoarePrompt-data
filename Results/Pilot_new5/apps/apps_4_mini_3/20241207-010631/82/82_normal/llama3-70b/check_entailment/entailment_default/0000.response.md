The provided program aims to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program uses two functions: `func_1`, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, and `func_2`, which calculates the LCM of two integers based on the relationship between LCM and GCD.

### Initial Assessment
The main loop of the program starts at \( k = 0 \) and continuously computes the LCM for increasing values of \( k \), stopping when an LCM value does not decrease anymore. The last \( k \) value that produced a smaller LCM is printed. 

### Edge Cases
1. **Zero Values**: Since both \( a \) and \( b \) are guaranteed to be at least 1 (as per constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \)), there are no zero values to worry about.
2. **Identical Values**: The program should handle cases where \( a = b \) correctly, as the LCM will simply be \( a + k \) for any \( k \).
3. **Different Values**: The program should correctly identify the optimal \( k \) when \( a \) and \( b \) are different.

### Checking the Output Hints
The output hints for `func_1` and `func_2` seem to accurately describe what these functions do:
- `func_1` correctly identifies the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm without the risk of returning zero (since \( a \) and \( b \) are always positive).
- `func_2` correctly computes the LCM based on the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

### Conclusion
After examining both the code and its description, I see that the code aims to fulfill the problem's requirements effectively. Furthermore, the program's logic and structure appear sound since it handles valid inputs as specified in the constraints.

Since I cannot find an instance where the program fails to meet the problem requirements or where the hints are misleading, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
