The provided program aims to determine the maximum possible value of the mex of an array after performing a series of operations on it. The mex (minimum excluded value) is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. It reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array.
2. It then reads the array `arr` and sorts it.
3. The variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
4. It iterates through each number `num` in the sorted array:
   - If `num` equals `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.
   - If `num` exceeds `mex`, it breaks out of the loop since no further numbers can affect the value of `mex`.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

### Potential Issues:

- The algorithm assumes that it will only increment `mex` when it encounters numbers equal to the current `mex`. However, the operations allow for making any number in the array less than or equal to its original value, and it is essential to consider that we can manipulate the numbers strategically to fill all gaps up to a potential maximum `mex`.
- If there are multiple duplicates of a number greater than `mex`, the algorithm might not handle the situation correctly, as it may prematurely break the loop when it encounters the first number greater than `mex`, ignoring the possibility of adjusting other numbers in the array to be `mex`.

### Test Case:

Consider the following input:
```
5
2 2 2 3 4
```
- The expected behavior is that we can decrease some of the `2`s (e.g., to `1`) to have an array like `1, 1, 2, 3, 4`, which would yield a `mex` of `5`.
- However, the current program's logic would skip over the number `1` since it starts with `mex = 1` and encounters `2` immediately. It would increment `mex` to `2`, then to `3`, then break when it encounters `3`, resulting in a `mex` output of `4`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly evaluate all possible operations to derive the maximum `mex`.

Correctness: **False**.
