According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next element in `arr`. Given that `arr` is sorted and `n` represents the number of elements in `arr`, if the loop is to execute one more time, there must be more elements left in `arr` to process.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000,
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers,
- `num` is the next element in `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that we are now processing the next element in the list, which would be the next index after the current `num`. Thus, if `num` is the last element in `arr`, the loop will not execute again.

Assuming that `num` has not reached the end of the list, we must adjust `num` to reflect the next integer in the sorted list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we also need to ensure that `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` after the current one; `mex` is unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration.**
