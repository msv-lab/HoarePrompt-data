To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's evaluate the logic in the `func()` function step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Alyona has an array of positive integers.
2. She can decrease any element of the array to any smaller positive integer.
3. The goal is to determine the maximum possible "mex" of the array after performing any number of operations.
4. The "mex" is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`.
   - It handles input correctly as specified.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - It sorts the array `arr`. This is useful for determining the "mex" in a sequential manner.

3. **Calculating the "mex"**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
   - It iterates through the sorted array:
     - If the current number matches `mex`, it increments `mex`.
     - If the current number is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop, as all subsequent numbers (being sorted) will also be greater.

### Correctness Verification:
- The loop essentially checks for each integer starting from 1 to the maximum possible value of `mex`:
  - If `mex` is present in `arr`, it can be incremented.
  - If `mex` is not present and a larger number is encountered, the loop breaks, ensuring that no number less than `mex` can block it from being the smallest missing positive integer.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum possible "mex" of the given array based on the operations described. It handles all edge cases as the sorted array allows it to efficiently determine missing integers. Additionally, it respects the constraints of the problem regarding the operations Alyona can perform.

Thus, the program performs as intended for all possible inputs defined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
