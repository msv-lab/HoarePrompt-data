The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in place. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the number of elements in `arr`. The values of the elements in `arr` will now be in non-decreasing order, but the specific arrangement depends on the input values. Thus, the output state reflects the sorted nature of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers.**
