The code indicates a break statement. This means that the current loop or conditional statement is exited without altering the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `arr`, `num`, and `mex` remain unchanged as a result of this instruction. Therefore, the Output State is essentially a reflection of the initial state without any modifications.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` (the next integer in the sorted order); `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
