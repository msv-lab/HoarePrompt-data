According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `arr`. The loop will run for each element in `arr`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, we can conclude that `arr` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `num` will represent the first element in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we ensure that `arr` contains at least 1 element, and `num` is set to the first element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the first element in `arr`**.
