According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute for each element in the list `a`, and since `n` is a positive integer, it indicates that `a` will have at least one element. Given that `mex` is initialized to 1, it also does not affect the loop execution directly. 

For the loop to execute, `num` will take the value of the first element in the sorted list `a` during the first iteration. Therefore, `num` should be set to the first element of the list `a`, and `n` confirms that there is at least one element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (where `n` must be at least 1), `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
