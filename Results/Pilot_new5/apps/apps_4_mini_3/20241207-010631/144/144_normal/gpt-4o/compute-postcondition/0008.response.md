According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. The loop will continue iterating as long as there are elements in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and since `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, the next value of `num` for the loop to execute one more time will be the second element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `a` must still contain at least 2 elements, and `num` will be updated to the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`.**
