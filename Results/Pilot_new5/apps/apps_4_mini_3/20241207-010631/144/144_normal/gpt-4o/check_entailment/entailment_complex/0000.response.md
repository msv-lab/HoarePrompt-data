Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here’s an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array and then reads a list of `n` integers. This matches the input specifications given in the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `a`. This is crucial because to determine the maximum possible value of `mex`, the elements need to be processed in increasing order. By sorting the array, we ensure that we can easily track which integers are present and what the next potential `mex` value should be.

3. **Calculating mex**: The program correctly initializes `mex` to 1 and iterates through the sorted list `a`. For each number in `a`, if the number is greater than or equal to the current `mex`, the program increments `mex`. This effectively simulates the best-case scenario for forming the array `b`, where Alyona can reduce any element in `a` to any positive integer less than or equal to itself.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the calculated `mex`, which is the minimum positive integer that does not appear in the modified array `b`.

The logic of increasing `mex` while iterating over the sorted input ensures that we account for every integer that can be represented by the operations allowed (decreasing any element in `a` to any number ≤ itself). 

In conclusion, since the program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description, it is correct.
