Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Limak's initial weight is equal to Bob's initial weight (both are 1). According to the problem description, Limak should become heavier than Bob in one year. The logic correctly identifies that Limak's weight will be tripled (becoming 3) and Bob's weight will be doubled (becoming 2) after one year, which is correct. However, if the weights were initially equal and both greater than 1, the output would be incorrect. 

For example:
- Input: `1 1` should return `1`, which is handled correctly.
- Input: `2 2` would result in Limak weighing 6 and Bob weighing 4 after one year, but this input is not explicitly handled by the logic since both weights should be treated as distinct once the loop condition is checked. 

The edge cases where a and b are equal (for instance, `2 2`) need to be properly considered, leading to inadequate comparisons in the while loop, thus resulting in an incorrect output.
