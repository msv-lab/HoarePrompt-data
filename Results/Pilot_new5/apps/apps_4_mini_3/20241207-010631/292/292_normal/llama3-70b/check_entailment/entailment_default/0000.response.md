To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code and the output hints.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Limak's weight `a` is tripled every year.
- Bob's weight `b` is doubled every year.
- We need to find out how many full years it will take for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```
- Initially, the program takes input for Limak's weight `a` and Bob's weight `b`.
- A loop runs as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight, incrementing `years` and updating their weights.
- Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, the loop terminates, and the number of years is printed.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
- The hints state that the function calculates the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight, which aligns with the code logic.

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. If both weights are equal (e.g., `1 1`), Limak's weight must exceed Bob's weight in one year. The program would correctly compute `3` for Limak and `2` for Bob and return `1` as output, which is correct.
2. The weights are within the range `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, making it easy to evaluate all possible combinations that could occur in this context.

**Conclusion:**
Upon review, the program correctly simulates the weight growth of Limak and Bob according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases outlined in the examples, including situations where Limak starts with equal weight to Bob. 

Thus, the program adheres strictly to the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
