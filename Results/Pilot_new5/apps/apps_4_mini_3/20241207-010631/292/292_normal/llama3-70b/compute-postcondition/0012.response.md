The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. The initial state tells us that `b` is at least `orig_a * 9`, and since the operation does not change `years` or `a`, we can focus on how `b` is affected. 

After doubling, `b` would be at least `2 * (orig_a * 9)`, which means `b` is now greater than or equal to `orig_a * 18`. 

The output state will therefore include the updated value of `b` and confirm that `years` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`years` is now 2, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 27`, `b` is greater than or equal to `orig_a * 18`**.
