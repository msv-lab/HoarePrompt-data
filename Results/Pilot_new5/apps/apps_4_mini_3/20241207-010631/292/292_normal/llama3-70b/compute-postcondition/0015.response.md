The code snippet `print(years)` outputs the value of the variable `years`. Since `years` is already defined as the number of iterations it took for `a` to exceed `b`, and based on the initial state where `a` is greater than `b`, the output will simply reflect the existing value of `years`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is the number of iterations it took for `a` to exceed `b`, and `years` has been printed.**
