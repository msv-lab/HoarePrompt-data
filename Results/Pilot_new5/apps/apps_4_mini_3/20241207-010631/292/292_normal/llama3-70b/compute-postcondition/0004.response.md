The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Given that `b` is an integer from input such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the new value of `b` will remain within the range of \(2 \leq b \leq 20\) after the multiplication. The values of `years` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `years` is 0, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3`, and `b` is now equal to `b * 2` (where \(2 \leq b \leq 20\)).

Output State: **`years` is 0, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3`, and `b` is now equal to `b * 2` (where \(2 \leq b \leq 20\)).**
