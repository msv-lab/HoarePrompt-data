The variable `a` is assigned the value of `a` multiplied by 3. Since `a` is currently equal to `orig_a * 3`, the new value of `a` will be `orig_a * 3 * 3`, or `orig_a * 9`. The other variables `years`, `b`, and `orig_a` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `orig_a` must still hold true.

Output State: **`years` is 1, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 9`, `b` is now equal to `b * 2`, and `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \(\frac{b \times 2}{3}\)**
