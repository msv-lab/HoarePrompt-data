The variable `years` is incremented by 1. The value of `years` is not specified in the initial state, but it is increased by 1. The variable `a` remains an integer between 27 and 120, and `b` remains invalid; therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 27 and 120, `b` remains invalid, and `years` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 27 and 120, `b` remains invalid, `years` is increased by 1**
