Upon analyzing the problem description, the task is to calculate how many years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight given that Limak's weight triples each year while Bob's weight doubles. 

The provided program implements this logic correctly:

```python
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code takes two integers as input (`a` and `b`).
2. It initializes a counter `years` to 0.
3. It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
4. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled, Bob's weight is doubled, and the `years` counter is incremented.
5. Finally, the function prints the total number of years when Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

### Edge Cases:
- The problem allows for weights `a` and `b` between 1 and 10, with `a` being less than or equal to `b`. 
- The edge case where `a` is initially equal to `b` is handled correctly, as the loop will iterate until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

No edge cases seem to be missed, as Limak will always become heavier in a bounded number of steps due to the rates of increase (tripling vs doubling).

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints confirm that the function correctly captures the logic of the problem statement: it calculates how many years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's and then prints this value.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles the edge cases appropriately, the output hints also agree with the program functionality.

Correctness: **True**.
