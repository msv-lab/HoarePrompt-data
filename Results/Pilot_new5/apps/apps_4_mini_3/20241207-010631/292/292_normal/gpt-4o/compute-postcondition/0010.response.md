According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop can continue to execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer between 9 and 90, and `b` is at least `2a` and up to 40. 

For the loop to run one more time, `a` must still be less than or equal to `b`. Given that `b` is at least `2a`, this means that `a` can be up to 40 to ensure that `b` remains valid (as `b` can only go up to 40). 

If `a` is greater than 40, then `b` would not be able to satisfy the condition of being at least `2a` and still being less than or equal to 40, which would prevent the loop from executing again. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the conditions such that `a` must remain less than or equal to 40.

State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and 40; `b` is at least `2a` and up to `40`; `years` is increased by 1**
