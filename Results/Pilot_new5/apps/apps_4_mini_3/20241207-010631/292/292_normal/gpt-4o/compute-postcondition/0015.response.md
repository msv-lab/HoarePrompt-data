The code snippet `print(years)` outputs the value of the variable `years`. The initial state indicates that `years` is at least 3, but it does not change the value of `years`. Therefore, the output will reflect the fact that `years` retains its value of at least 3. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is at least 3, the final value of `a` is greater than 120, and the final value of `b` is less than 80; `years` is printed.**
