Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing Limak's and Bob's weights, respectively. The constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) are guaranteed.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**: The program calculates the weights of Limak and Bob over the years:
   - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   This matches the described behavior in the problem statement where Limak's weight grows threefold and Bob's weight grows twofold every year.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues while Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). This ensures that the program will only stop once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

4. **Year Counter**: The `years` variable is incremented in each iteration of the loop, which counts the number of full years that pass until Limak weighs more than Bob.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob, which is the required output.

The program successfully addresses all aspects of the problem description and will produce the correct output for any given valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
