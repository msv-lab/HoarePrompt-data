The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is initially an integer between 9 and 40, the new value of `a` will be between 27 and 120. The variable `b` remains unchanged but must still satisfy the condition of being at least `2a` and up to `40`. However, since `a` is now greater than 40, this condition cannot be satisfied unless the initial value of `a` was restricted higher than its original range, which it cannot be. Therefore, `b` cannot be a valid integer anymore if we strictly adhere to the modified constraints. The variable `years` was previously increased by 1 but remains unchanged during this calculation. 

Thus, the output state reflects the new conditions on `a` and indicates that `b` is invalid.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 27 and 120; `b` is invalid; `years` is increased by 1**
