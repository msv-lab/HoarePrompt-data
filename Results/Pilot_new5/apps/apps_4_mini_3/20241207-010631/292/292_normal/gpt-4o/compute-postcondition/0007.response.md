The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. Given that `a` is an integer between 3 and 30, after the multiplication, `a` will be between 9 and 90. The variable `b` must still be at least equal to `a` and within the bounds of being between `2a` and 20, inclusive. However, since the new value of `a` could be greater than 20, it is important to check if `b` can still remain valid.

After the operation, `a` will be `3 * a`. The conditions for `b` will also need to be checked, where `b` must remain at least `a` and also within `2a` and 20 if that range still holds after the multiplication.

Given that:
- If `a` is initially in the range [3, 30], then:
  - After multiplying by 3: `a` will be in the range [9, 90]
  - The minimum value for `b` would now be at least 9, and we need to evaluate if it can still be within the range of [2a, 20].

Depending on the value of `a`, the valid range for `b` may change. If `a` becomes greater than 10, `2a` will exceed 20 making `b` invalid under its conditions. 

Therefore, the output state reflecting the changes will be:
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and 90, `b` must be at least equal to `a` and if `a` is greater than 10, then `b` is invalid. If `a` is less than or equal to 10, `b` is within the bounds of being at least `a` and between `2a` and 20, inclusive.**
