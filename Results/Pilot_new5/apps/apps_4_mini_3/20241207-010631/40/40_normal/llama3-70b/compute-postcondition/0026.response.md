The value of `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[1:3]`, its length is 2. Therefore, `max_len` will either remain the same or be updated to a value greater than or equal to 2, depending on its previous value. The conditions of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is now max(max_len, 2), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]**
