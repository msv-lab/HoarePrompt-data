According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is equal to the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute at least once. The loop variable `i` will start from 0 at the beginning of the first iteration. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s` (which is at least 1), `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
