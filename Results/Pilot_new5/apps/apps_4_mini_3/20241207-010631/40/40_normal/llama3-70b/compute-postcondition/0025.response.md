`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending before index `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `substr` will be the characters in `s` at index 1 and index 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]` (the characters at index 1 and index 2 of `s`).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`.**
