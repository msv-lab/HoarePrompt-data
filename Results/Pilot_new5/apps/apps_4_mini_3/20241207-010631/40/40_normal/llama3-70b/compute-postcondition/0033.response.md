According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, meaning the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`**
