According to the code, the execution of the loop is determined by the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, we can deduce that:

- The starting point for `j` is `i + 1`, which is 2.
- The end point for `j` is `n + 1`, which is at least 3 since `n` is greater than 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `j` needs to start at 2, and since `j` is initialized to `n + 1`, it must be adjusted. The for loop will not execute if `j` starts at a value greater than `n + 1`, meaning we need to ensure `j` is set appropriately before the loop begins.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should start at `2` for the loop to run, not at `n + 1`.
- The loop is valid since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
