`max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a character at index 1 of `s`, its length is 1. The value of `max_len` will either stay the same if it is greater than or equal to 1, or it will be updated to 1 if `max_len` was previously less than 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `max_len` is updated to be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `substr` is the character at index 1 of `s`, and the character `substr` is not equal to its reverse.**
