To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the length of the longest substring of a string `s` that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, the output should be `0`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func` reads a string `s`, calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring using nested loops, and prints the length. 

The critical part of the logic involves:
- Iterating over all possible substrings using two nested loops.
- Checking if each substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).
- Updating the maximum length (`max_len`) if a non-palindromic substring is found.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring and prints either this length or `0` if all substrings are palindromic.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Character Strings**: Any single character string (e.g., "a") is a palindrome, so the expected result should be `0`. The program correctly identifies that there are no non-palindromic substrings in this case.
2. **All Characters the Same**: For strings like "aaaaa", every substring is a palindrome. The function should return `0`, which it does correctly.
3. **Non-Palindromic Strings**: Strings like "abc" should return their full length (i.e., `3`), which the program handles correctly.
4. **Substrings**: The code properly checks all possible substrings, ensuring no non-palindromic substrings are missed.

### Potential Issues:
While the program appears to cover the expected cases, there is a subtle performance concern due to the nested loops checking all substrings. However, given the constraints (maximum length of 50), this does not impact correctness, just efficiency.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies the length of the longest non-palindromic substring according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases as specified.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
