According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, starting from `i + 1` (which is 3) up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1, resulting in `j` being 4. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `j` will be 4, the only condition that needs to be stated is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either unchanged or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`.**
