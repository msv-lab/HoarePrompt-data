The length of the string `s` is calculated and assigned to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters, `n` will be a positive integer corresponding to the length of `s`, which is at least 1 and at most 50. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`.**
