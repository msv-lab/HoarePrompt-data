The code assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j` (exclusive) to the variable `substr`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `substr` will contain the character at index 1 of the string `s`. Other variables remain unchanged, and the state of `substr` is dependent on the contents of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `substr` is the character at index 1 of `s`**
