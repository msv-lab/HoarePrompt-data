According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. In the current state at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to 2. Additionally, since `n` is the length of `s`, it will remain the same. The conditions regarding `substr` and its reverse are already met.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first character of `s`**.
