Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False if `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', and the values of `t` and `dir` remain unchanged; if `dir` is not 'West' or 'East', the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` retain their initial state.***
