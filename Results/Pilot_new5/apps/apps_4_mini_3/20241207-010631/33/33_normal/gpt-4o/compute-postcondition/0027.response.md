Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer such that `-t < 0`, and `dir` retains its initial value. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` retain their initial state.***
