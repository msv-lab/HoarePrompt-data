The variable `t` and `dir` are assigned values from the input, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts. The previous values of `n`, `position`, and `valid` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignments of `t` and `dir` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**.
