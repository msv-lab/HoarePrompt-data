The function accepts a positive integer `n` which indicates how many movements to process. For each movement, it takes a positive integer `t` and a direction (`North`, `South`, `East`, or `West`). The function checks if these movements keep the position within the bounds of 0 to 20000. If any movement causes the position to go below 0 or above 20000, or if the final position is not 0, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return a typical value, but rather prints the result based on the validity of the movements.
