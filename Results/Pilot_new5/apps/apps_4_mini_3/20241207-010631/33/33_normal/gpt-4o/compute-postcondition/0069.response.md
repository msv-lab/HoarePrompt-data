The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on a series of inputs provided through the standard input, where the first line indicates a positive integer `n` (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) that specifies the number of subsequent lines. Each of the next `n` lines contains two pieces of information: a positive integer `t_i` (with the constraint 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction string `dir_i`, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided details. Therefore, I will summarize that it processes the input data based on the given constraints but does not return a typical value in the conventional sense.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` indicating the number of subsequent lines of input. Each of those lines contains a positive integer `t_i` and a direction string `dir_i`. The function processes this input according to its internal logic, but does not return a typical value.**
