Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an input integer converted to an actual integer, and `dir` is an input string. If `position - t` is less than 0, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition does not apply as there is no else part.***
