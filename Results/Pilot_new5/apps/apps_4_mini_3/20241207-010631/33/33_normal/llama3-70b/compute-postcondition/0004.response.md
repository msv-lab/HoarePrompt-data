The variable `t` is converted to an integer using `int(t)`. This means that `t` is now assigned the value of `int(t)`, which could change depending on the original type of `t`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input value**
