The value of `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its previous value of 90. Since `curr_lat` is being modified, we will express its new value based on the input value of `t`. The variable `t` retains its value as the integer value of the input, and the variable `dir` remains unchanged since the code does not affect it. 

Thus, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 - t / 111.195`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 - t / 111.195, `t` is the integer value of the input, `dir` is an input value and `dir` is not 'South'**.
