The code checks if `curr_lat` is equal to 90 and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `curr_lat` can be between -90 and 90, inclusive, meaning it can take on any value within that range.

Since `curr_lat` is not necessarily equal to 90, the output could be either 'YES' or 'NO'. However, the specific value of `curr_lat` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected, and the `print` statement does not alter any variable values.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is between -90 and 90, inclusive; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; all directions are valid strings corresponding to 'North' or 'South'; printed value is either 'YES' or 'NO'.**
