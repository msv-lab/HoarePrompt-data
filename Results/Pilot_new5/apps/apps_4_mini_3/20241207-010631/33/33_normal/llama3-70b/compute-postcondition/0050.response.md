Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the current iteration of the loop has been skipped.***
