The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are directly altered, and no values are returned. However, since the program exits, any subsequent code will not execute, and the previous state of the variables remains unchanged.

The Output State reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that the program has exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; current iteration of the loop was skipped; 'NO' is printed; the program has exited.**
