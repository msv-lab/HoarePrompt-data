To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Limak starts at the North Pole (latitude 90).
2. He can only move South if he is at the North Pole and only move North if he is at the South Pole.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (latitude 90).
4. Moves to the West or East should not affect the latitude.
5. The program must print "YES" if the journey conditions are satisfied and "NO" otherwise.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, which is correct as Limak starts at the North Pole.
2. **Processing Directions**:
   - The input is read correctly.
   - For each direction:
     - If moving **North**, it increases `curr_lat`. This is incorrect since moving North from the North Pole is not allowed by the problem description.
     - If moving **South**, it decreases `curr_lat` correctly.
     - **West** and **East** directions are ignored, which is acceptable as they do not affect latitude.
3. **Bounds Checking**:
   - The program checks if `curr_lat` goes below -90 or above 90 at any point, which is valid.
   - If `curr_lat` is exactly -90, it checks if the next move is **North**.
   - If `curr_lat` is exactly 90, it checks if the next move is **South**.
4. **Final Check**: After all moves, it checks if `curr_lat` is 90 to print "YES" or "NO".

### Issues Identified:
- The major flaw is that the program allows Limak to move **North** when he is at the North Pole, which violates the first condition of the problem description. The program does not handle this explicitly and allows a move to **North** even when it is not allowed.
- There is a logical gap in handling the journey's ending condition since the program does not ensure that all parts of the journey correctly adhere to the restrictions on movement.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, the program does not adhere strictly to the requirements set forth in the problem description. Specifically, it allows an invalid move when Limak is at the North Pole.

Correctness: **False**
