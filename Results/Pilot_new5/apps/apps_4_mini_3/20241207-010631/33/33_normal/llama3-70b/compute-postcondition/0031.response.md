The command `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and jump to the next iteration. Given that no variable values are modified by this command, the state of the other variables remains unchanged, and we only note that the program will continue to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the integer value of the input, `dir` is an input value and `dir` is not 'South', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
