The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction string `dir_i` that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". 

The function does not return a specific value as it is not defined in the provided output. However, based on the constraints, the purpose of this function could involve processing the directions and their associated integer values in some manner. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction string dir_i ("North", "South", "West", or "East"). The exact return value or behavior is not specified.**
