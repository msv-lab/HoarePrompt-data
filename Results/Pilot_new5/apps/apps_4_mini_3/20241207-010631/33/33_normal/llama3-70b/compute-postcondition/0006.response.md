`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, so after the operation, `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`. The values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is 'North'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 + `t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is 'North'**.
