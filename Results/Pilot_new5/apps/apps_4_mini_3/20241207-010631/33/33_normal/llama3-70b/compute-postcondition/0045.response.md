The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string input into an integer. The value of `t` before execution was a string, and after the conversion, it is now an integer. The state of `n` and `dir` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string from input, updated based on the split input.**
