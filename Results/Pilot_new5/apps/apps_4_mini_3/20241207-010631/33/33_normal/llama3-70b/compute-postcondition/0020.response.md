The code `exit()` indicates that the program should terminate immediately. No variables are modified or assigned new values, and the program exits without further execution. The conditions surrounding the program state remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is -90; `dir` is not 'North'; 'NO' is printed and the program exits.**
