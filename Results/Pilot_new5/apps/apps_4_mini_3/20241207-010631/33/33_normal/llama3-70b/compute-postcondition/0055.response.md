The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. As a result, no further execution occurs, and the previous state of the variables remains unchanged. The output state will reflect that the program has exited without any modification.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; 'NO' is printed, and the program exits.**
