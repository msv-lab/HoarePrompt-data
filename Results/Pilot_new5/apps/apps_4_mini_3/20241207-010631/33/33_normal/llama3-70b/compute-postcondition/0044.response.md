The variable `t` is assigned a value from `input()`, and `dir` is reassigned to the second part of the split input. The values of `n` and `dir` can change based on the input. The initial state of `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 and `dir` is a string, but the specific values of `t` and `dir` will now depend on user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `t` is now a string (from the input), and `dir` has been updated with a new string value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is a string from input; `dir` is a string from input, updated based on the split input.**
