Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program effectively solves the problem as described. 

Here's why the solution is correct:

1. The program reads an integer `n` which represents the initial game-coin score of Kolya.
2. It uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `a` (number of houses) and `b` (number of cars), while calculating `c`, the number of computers, directly based on the remaining coins after accounting for the cost of houses and cars.
3. The outer loop iterates `a` from 0 to `n // 1234567`, ensuring all possible numbers of houses that can be bought are considered without exceeding `n`.
4. The inner loop iterates `b` from 0 to the remaining coins divided by the cost of a car, again ensuring that the number of cars does not exceed the available coins after buying houses.
5. The value of `c` is calculated as the remaining coins divided by the cost of a computer and is non-negative since the program checks if the remaining money after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars is sufficient to buy `c` computers.
6. The condition checks if the total spent on houses, cars, and computers matches `n`, and if so, it prints "YES" and exits.
7. If no combination is found after testing all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program comprehensively checks for all combinations of purchasing houses, cars, and computers such that their total cost equals `n`. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), the nested loop structure can handle the necessary calculations within a reasonable time frame due to the decreasing number of iterations as `a` increases.

No edge cases or missing logic were identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the specified range. Thus, it works according to the requirements stated in the problem description.
