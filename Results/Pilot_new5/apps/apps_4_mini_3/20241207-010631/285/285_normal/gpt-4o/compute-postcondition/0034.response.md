Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased without exceeding `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program will return 'YES'; otherwise, it will not return 'YES'.**
