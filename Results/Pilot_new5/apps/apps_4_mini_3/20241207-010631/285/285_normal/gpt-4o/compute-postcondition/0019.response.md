According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a` and the maximum limit that is defined by `n // house_cost + 1`. The loop will execute for values of `a` starting from 0 up to `n // house_cost`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 0, and the loop will execute again for the next value of `a`, which will be 1. The loop will continue executing as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // house_cost`.

Given that `n` is at least `1234567`, and we have not specified `house_cost`, it follows that for the loop to execute one more time, `a` should be incremented by 1. The value of `b` may also change, but since it is derived from the variables `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`, we can keep it at its previously defined state.

Thus, after the next iteration starts, `a` will be 1.

State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`**
