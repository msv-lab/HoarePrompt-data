Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `1234567`, `b` is 2, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - 2 * car_cost` which is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES' indicating the conditions are satisfied.***
