The variable `remaining_after_houses` is calculated by taking `n` and subtracting the product of `a` and `house_cost`. The value of `n` is at least `1234567`, and `a` is `0`. Since `a` is `0`, the term `a * house_cost` will also be `0`, which means `remaining_after_houses` will be equal to `n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and the impact of the code is that `remaining_after_houses` is now equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `1234567`, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`**
