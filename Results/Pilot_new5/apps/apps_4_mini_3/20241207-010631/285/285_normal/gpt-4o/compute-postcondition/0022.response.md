To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact on the variables mentioned in the initial state.

1. **Variables Involved**: 
   - `remaining_after_houses`: This variable is non-negative.
   - `b`: This variable is 0.
   - `car_cost`: This variable is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The line of code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` indicates that `remaining_after_cars` will be calculated.
   - Since `b` is 0, the expression `b * car_cost` evaluates to 0, regardless of the value of `car_cost`.
   - Thus, `remaining_after_cars` will equal `remaining_after_houses - 0`, which simplifies to just `remaining_after_houses`.

3. **Conclusion**: 
   - We will not change the value of `remaining_after_houses`.
   - The new variable `remaining_after_cars` is introduced, which will simply hold the same value as `remaining_after_houses`.

### Output State

Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
