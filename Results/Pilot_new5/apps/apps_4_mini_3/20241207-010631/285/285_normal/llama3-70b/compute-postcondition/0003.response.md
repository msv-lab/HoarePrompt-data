The value of `c` is assigned the result of the calculation `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. Given that `a` and `b` are both 0, the equation simplifies to `c = n // 1234`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and `a` and `b` have not affected the calculation, the state of `c` depends solely on the value of `n`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `n // 1234`**
