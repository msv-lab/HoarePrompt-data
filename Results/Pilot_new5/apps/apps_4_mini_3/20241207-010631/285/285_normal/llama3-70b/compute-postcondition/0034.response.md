The code `exit()` leads to an immediate termination of the program. The values of the variables do not change, and we simply end the execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1481479; `a` is 1; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - 1481479) // 1234; and 'YES' has been printed.
