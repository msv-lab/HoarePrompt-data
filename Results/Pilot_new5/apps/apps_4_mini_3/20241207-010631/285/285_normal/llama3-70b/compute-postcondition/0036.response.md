Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1234567; `a` is 1; `b` is in the range from 0 to `(n - 1234567) // 123456`, and `c` is a non-negative integer such that `c = (n - 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234` for each iteration. The program exits if there exists non-negative integers `b` and `c` such that `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`. If no such combinations exist after all possible values of `b` have been checked, the program does not exit.**
