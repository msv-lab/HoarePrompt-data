The `exit()` call terminates the program immediately. As a result, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program exits without any further modifications or outputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited.**
