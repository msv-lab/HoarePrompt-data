The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. As a result, no variables are changed or updated beyond this point, and the program will cease execution without altering the existing values or printing anything else.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2469134`, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 2592590) // 1234`, and 'YES' is printed.**
