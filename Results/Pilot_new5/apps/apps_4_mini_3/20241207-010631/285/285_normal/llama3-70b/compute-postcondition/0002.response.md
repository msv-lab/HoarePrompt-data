To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the state before the loop and the loop's range.

1. The variable `n` is an input positive integer, which is already satisfied by the condition 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.
2. The variable `a` is 0, making the expression `(n - a * 1234567)` equal to `n`.
3. The loop will execute as long as the condition in the `range` function results in a non-negative integer.

The expression for the loop is:
```
range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1)
```
With `a` being 0, the expression simplifies to:
```
range(n // 123456 + 1)
```
4. For the loop to execute, we need `n // 123456` to be at least 0. Since `n` is always at least 1 (the minimum positive integer), `n // 123456` will be 0 if `n` is less than 123456, which would yield a range of 1 (i.e., `range(0 + 1)` which means the loop will run once). The loop will run multiple times if `n` is greater than or equal to 123456. 

Thus, the following states are relevant:
- `n` must be positive, which it already is.
- `a` is 0, so no changes are necessary for `a`.
- Since `n` is an input integer, we should note that depending on the value of `n`, the number of iterations can vary from 1 to a maximum depending on how large `n` is.

To summarize:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is confirmed to be 0.
- `b` will be initialized to the first value in the range of the loop, which is 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0**
