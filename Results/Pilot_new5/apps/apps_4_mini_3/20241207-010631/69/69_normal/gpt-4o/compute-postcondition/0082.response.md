The variable `current_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` is not specified but will change. The other variables `target_pos`, `position_map`, and `i` retain their values post-execution.

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy); `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`; `i` must be less than n - 1; `current_y` is decremented by 1.**
