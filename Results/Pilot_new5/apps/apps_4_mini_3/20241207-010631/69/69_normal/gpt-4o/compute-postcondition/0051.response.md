The variable `current_y` is decremented by 1, changing its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Since `current_y` was initially 0, after execution, it becomes -1.

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations, `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`, `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`, `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, `min_length` is set to float('inf'), `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the operation at index `i` is 'D'.**
