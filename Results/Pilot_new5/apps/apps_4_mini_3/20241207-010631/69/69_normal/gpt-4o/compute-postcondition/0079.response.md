The code updates `position_map` with the key being the tuple `(current_x, current_y)` and the value being `i`. The previous conditions of `target_pos` being updated and potentially affecting `min_length` remain valid. However, `min_length` will not change due to this specific line of code, as it only updates `position_map`. 

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`.**
