The variable `final_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `final_x` was 0, so the new value of `final_x` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, `op` is not equal to 'L', and the current value of `op` is 'R'**
