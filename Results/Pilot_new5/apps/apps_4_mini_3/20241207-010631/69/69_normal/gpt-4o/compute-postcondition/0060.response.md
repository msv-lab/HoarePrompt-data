Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations, `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`, `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`, `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, `min_length` is set to float('inf'), `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and `n` is greater than 0. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', then `current_y` is -1. Otherwise, if the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` is 0. If the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is 1 and `current_y` is 0.***
