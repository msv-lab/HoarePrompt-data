To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze how the program functions against the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

### Problem Review:
1. **Input Specifications**:
   - The program receives an integer `n`, a string of operations consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and the target coordinates `(x, y)`.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - The program needs to compute the minimum length of a subsequence of operations that must be changed so that after executing all operations, the robot ends at the coordinates `(x, y)`. If it is impossible to reach `(x, y)` using `n` operations, the program should return `-1`.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Final Position Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates through the operations and calculates the final position of the robot (`final_x`, `final_y`) based on the operations provided. This matches the requirement of determining where the robot currently ends up after performing all operations.

2. **Calculating `dx` and `dy`**:
   - The program computes `dx` (the difference in the x-coordinate from the target) and `dy` (the difference in the y-coordinate from the target). This is essential for determining how far off the robot's position is from the goal.

3. **Handling No Change Case**:
   - If `dx` and `dy` are both zero, the function returns `0`, indicating no changes are necessary. This is in line with the requirement that if the robot is already at `(x, y)`, the length of the changed subsegment is `0`.

4. **Finding Minimum Change Length**:
   - The program maintains a dictionary `position_map` to track previously reached positions of the robot. It checks if the robot can reach the target position by changing existing operations. 
   - If the target position (after considering the required adjustments) exists in `position_map`, it calculates the length of the subsegment that would need to be changed and updates the minimum length accordingly.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - If `min_length` remains as `float('inf')`, it indicates that the changes cannot allow the robot to reach `(x, y)`, and thus it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length found.

### Edge Cases:
The program correctly handles various scenarios:
- Cases where no changes are needed.
- Cases where it's impossible to reach the target position due to a limitation of operations.
- It efficiently tracks positions with a time complexity of O(n), which is acceptable given the input constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem's requirements by calculating the final position, determining necessary changes to reach the target, and efficiently finding the minimum segment to change. It also utilizes edge case handling correctly.

Therefore, the program meets the specifications set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
