Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + 1 + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, `position_map` includes the updated position `(current_x + 1, current_y)` with value `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.***
