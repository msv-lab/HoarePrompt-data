To determine the output state after the execution of the provided Python code, we analyze the effects of the line of code on the variables involved in the initial state.

**Initial State:**  
*`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy) and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`, where `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1.*

Now, the code snippet given is:
```
target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
```

Analyzing the impact:
- The variable `target_pos` is updated based on the current values of `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy`.
- The values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them directly; it only calculates `target_pos`.
- The values of `dx` and `dy` are used in the calculation but are not modified either.

Since `target_pos` is calculated as `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, it incorporates both the current values and the deltas provided by `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the output state retains all previous information and updates only the `target_pos` variable based on the current inputs.

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`, where `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged.**
