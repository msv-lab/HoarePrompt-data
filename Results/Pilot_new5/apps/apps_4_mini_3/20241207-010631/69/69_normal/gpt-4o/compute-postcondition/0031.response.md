The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `final_x`, we will leave it as a reference. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within the same range, and `final_x` is incremented by 1.**
