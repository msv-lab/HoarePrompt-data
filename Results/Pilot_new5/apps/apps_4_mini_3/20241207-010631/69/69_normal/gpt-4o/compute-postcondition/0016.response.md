Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9. If `op` is 'D', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is -1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0. In all cases, `op` is not equal to 'U' and `op` is not equal to 'D' when in the else part.***
