`dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`. The value of `final_y` represents the net vertical displacement, and the variable `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`; `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`. 

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`; `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`.**
