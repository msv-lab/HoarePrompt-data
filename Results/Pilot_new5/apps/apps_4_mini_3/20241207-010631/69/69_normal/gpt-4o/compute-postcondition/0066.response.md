The `position_map` is updated to include the current position `(current_x, current_y)` with the index `i`. The other variables `final_x`, `final_y`, `target_pos`, `dx`, `dy`, and `min_length` remain unaffected by this line of code. The output will reflect the updated state of the `position_map` only.

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations, `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, `position_map` is updated to include (current_x, current_y) with value `i`, and `min_length` remains unchanged.**
