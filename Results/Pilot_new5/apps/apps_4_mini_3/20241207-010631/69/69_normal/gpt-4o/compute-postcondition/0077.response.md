The value of `min_length` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. The previous state indicates that `target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` based on the current operation at index `i`. The specific value of `position_map[target_pos]` would dictate how `min_length` is calculated, but since its value is not provided, we cannot specify the exact new value for `min_length`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `min_length` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. 

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `min_length` is updated to `min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])`.**
