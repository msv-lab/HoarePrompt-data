The variable `current_x` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `min_length` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are still valid. 

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`; `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`; `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to float('inf'); `current_x` is 0.**
