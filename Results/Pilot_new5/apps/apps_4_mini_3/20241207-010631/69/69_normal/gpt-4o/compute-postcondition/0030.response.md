The variable `final_x` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `final_x`, but since it is not mentioned in the initial conditions, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within the same range, `final_x` is decremented by 1.**
