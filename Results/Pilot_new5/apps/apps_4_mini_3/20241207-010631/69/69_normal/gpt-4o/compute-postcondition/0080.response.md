According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been updated to the value from the previous iteration, and thus we need to consider the increment that will occur at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to `i` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than this updated value of `i`.

State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy); `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`; `i` must be less than n - 1**
