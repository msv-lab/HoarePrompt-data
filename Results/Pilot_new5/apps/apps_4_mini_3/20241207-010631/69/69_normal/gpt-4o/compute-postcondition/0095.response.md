The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 200,000, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from the set {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, and `x` and `y` are integers that can take values within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. 

After executing the function body, if the net change in displacement is zero (both dx and dy are 0), the function returns 0. If a valid position is encountered during the loop, it returns `min_length` if it is not float('inf'); otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that no valid position was found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`, and return 0 if there is no net change in displacement. If there is a valid position, it returns the minimum length; if no valid position is found, it returns -1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, operations, x, and y, and returns 0 if there is no net change in displacement. If a valid position is found, it returns the minimum length; otherwise, it returns -1 if no valid position is encountered.**
