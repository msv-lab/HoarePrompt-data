The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `final_y` is 0, so after the execution, `final_y` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, and the first character of `operations` is 'U'.**
