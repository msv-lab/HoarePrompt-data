Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n` containing at least 1 character, and `op` is the first character of `operations`. If `op` is 'U', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'D', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0.***
