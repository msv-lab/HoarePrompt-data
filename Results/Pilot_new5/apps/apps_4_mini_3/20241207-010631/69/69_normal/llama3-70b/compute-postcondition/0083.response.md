The code contains a print statement which outputs the value of the variable `res`. The variable `res` holds the count of invalid operations in `operations`. The values of `n`, `dy`, `dx`, and `operations` are unaffected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `dy` is equal to max(0, y - uy), `dx` is equal to max(0, x - ux), `res` is equal to the count of invalid operations in `operations`, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing operations 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and `res` has been printed.**
