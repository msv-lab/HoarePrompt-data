To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to examine the conditions and outcomes based on the current state and the loop's logic.

We know that:
- The variable `op` dictates the behavior of the loop and can be one of 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L'.
- Depending on the value of `op`, either `dy` or `dx` may change, or both may remain the same.
- The state variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` are affected based on the conditions provided for each operation.

Since we don't have specifics about the values of `dx`, `dy`, or any particular operation occurring in this iteration, we can only conclude the general conditions necessary for the loop to continue.

1. **For 'U'**: `dy` decreases by 1 if `dy` is greater than 0.
2. **For 'D'**: If `dy` is less than 0, `dy` is set to 0.
3. **For 'R'**: `dx` decreases by 1 if `dx` is greater than 0.
4. **For 'L'**: If `dx` is less than 0, it is updated based on the expression `x - ux + 1`.

To execute one more time, we also need to ensure that:
- If `op` is 'R', `dx` needs to be greater than 0.
- If `op` is 'L', `dx` can be less than 0, which allows it to be updated.

Based on the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust:
- If `op` was 'U' and `dy` was greater than 0, then `dy` becomes `dy - 1`.
- If `op` was 'D' and `dy` was less than 0, then `dy` becomes 0.
- If `op` was 'R' and `dx` was greater than 0, then `dx` becomes `dx - 1`.
- If `op` was 'L' and `dx` was less than 0, then `dx` gets updated to `x - ux + 1`.

Taking these into account, we summarize the adjustments needed for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` and `dy` are updated according to the rules defined above with respect to the last `op`, and other variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
