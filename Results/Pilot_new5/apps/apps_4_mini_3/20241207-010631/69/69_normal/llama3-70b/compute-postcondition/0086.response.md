Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It computes the net movement based on the operations and checks if the final coordinates can be reached from the initial coordinates (x, y). If the required movement in either the x or y direction is negative, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts and prints the number of operations that could not be executed to reach the target coordinates.**
