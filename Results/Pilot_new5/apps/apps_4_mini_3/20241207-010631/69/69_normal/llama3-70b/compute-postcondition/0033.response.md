The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. Since it is not mentioned in the initial state, we don't know its previous value, but it could be any integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `ux` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 3, `op` is the third character of `operations`, and `ux` is decreased by 1.**
