The value of `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the value of `ux`, so we only know that its value has increased by 1. The states of `n` and `operations` are not affected, so we include them in the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 3, `ux` is increased by 1**
