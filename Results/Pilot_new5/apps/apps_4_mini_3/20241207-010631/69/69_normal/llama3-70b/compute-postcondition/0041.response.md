The code `print(-1)` does not modify any variables nor does it affect the state of the program except for producing an output. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged as their values are not altered by the print statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the print statement has been executed, resulting in the output of `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the current value of `dx` is `x - ux`, the current value of `dy` is `y - uy`, and either `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0; value `-1` has been printed.**
