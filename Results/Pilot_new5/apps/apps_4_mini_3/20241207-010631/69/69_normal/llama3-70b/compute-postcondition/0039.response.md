The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `x - ux`, and `dy` is assigned the value of `y - uy`. The values of `ux` and `uy` are based on the net movements determined by the operations string, while `lx` and `ly` remain 0 as stated. The initial values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State incorporates the new values of `dx` and `dy`, while keeping the current state of all other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`.**
