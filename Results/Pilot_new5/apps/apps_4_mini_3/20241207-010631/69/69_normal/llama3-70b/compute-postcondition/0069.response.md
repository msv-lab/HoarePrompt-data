Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 while `dy` remains unchanged, and other variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is increased by 1 and `dy` is updated according to the last `op`, while other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are updated according to the rules defined with respect to the last `op`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
