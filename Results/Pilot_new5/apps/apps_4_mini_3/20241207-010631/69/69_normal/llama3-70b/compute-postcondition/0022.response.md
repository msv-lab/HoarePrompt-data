The variable `uy` is decremented by 1. There are no indications of the previous value of `uy`, so it could be any integer. The other variables, `n` and `operations`, remain unaffected. Thus, the output state will reflect the change to `uy`, while `n` and `operations` retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `op` is the second character of `operations`, and `uy` is decreased by 1.**
