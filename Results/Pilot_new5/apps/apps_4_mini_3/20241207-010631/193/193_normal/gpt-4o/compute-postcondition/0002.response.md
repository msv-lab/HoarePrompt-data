The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `x` and `y` are integers with the relationships 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The output of the function is not provided, so it is unclear what the function returns based on these constraints. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine the specific functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
