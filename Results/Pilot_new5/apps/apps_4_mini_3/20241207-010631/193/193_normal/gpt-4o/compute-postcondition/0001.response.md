Given the initial conditions, `x` and `y` are integers such that \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). The code provided calculates a value based on the difference between `x` and `y`.

The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the following:
- The difference between `x` and `y` is computed as `x - y`.
- The integer division of this difference by 2 gives the first part of the output.
- The modulus operation with 2 gives the remainder, which will be either 0 or 1, and is added to the first part.

This means the output is essentially half of the difference rounded up, which can also be interpreted as the ceiling of the half difference.

Since the specific values for `x` and `y` are not provided, we will maintain that they satisfy the conditions given in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result of the expression is equal to `(x - y + 1) // 2`.**
