The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user through `map(int, input().split())`. The precondition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means `x` and `y` should still satisfy these conditions after assignment. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` after the execution will depend on the user's input. 

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y` without user input, we will express the output state based on the possible values:

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; `x` and `y` have been updated based on user input.**
