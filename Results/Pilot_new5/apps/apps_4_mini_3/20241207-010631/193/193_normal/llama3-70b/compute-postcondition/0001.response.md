The code executes the `print(abs(x - y))` statement, which outputs the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Since `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is guaranteed to be greater than `y`. Therefore, the expression `abs(x - y)` simplifies to `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but the output will reflect the calculated absolute difference.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` and `y` are integers based on user input; output is `x - y`.**
