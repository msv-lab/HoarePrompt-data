The program provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem states that Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into an equilateral triangle of side length \( y \) while ensuring that at every moment each side remains a positive integer and the triangle remains non-degenerate. This process requires careful step-by-step modifications of the triangle's sides, ensuring that the triangle inequalities are maintained.

The program, however, simply computes the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \) using `print(abs(x - y))`. This would imply that the minimum number of seconds required would be equal to the absolute difference in lengths, which is incorrect. The transformation of the sides does not occur linearly or simply as this suggests.

For example, if \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \), the program outputs \( 3 \) (since \( |6 - 3| = 3 \)), which does not account for the fact that the sides must be modified while keeping the triangle non-degenerate. The correct sequence outlined in the problem shows that it actually takes \( 4 \) steps, not \( 3 \).

Therefore, the function does not accurately implement the logic required by the problem description, as it does not consider the constraints of triangle formation during the modification process.

Correctness: **False**
