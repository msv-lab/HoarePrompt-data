The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is designed to operate with two integer variables `x` and `y` that satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value or output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently unclear regarding what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates with integers x and y that meet the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the return value is not specified.**
