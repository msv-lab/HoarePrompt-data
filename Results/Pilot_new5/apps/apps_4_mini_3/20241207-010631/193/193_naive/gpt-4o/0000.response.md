To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to delve into the logic implemented in the function.

The problem specifies that we need to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` through a series of modifications that must ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., having a positive area). 

The proposed function is as follows:

```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Step-by-step evaluation:
- The input consists of two integers `x` and `y` such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
- The code calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle of side length `x` to side length `y` using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{seconds} = \frac{x - y}{2} + (x - y) \% 2
  \]

### Logical Analysis:
1. The term `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many full reductions of 2 can be made until we drop to or below `y`.
2. The term `(x - y) % 2` handles the case when `x` and `y` differ by an odd number, ensuring that if we have one last unit length to reduce after making pairs, we account for that additional second.

### Validation:
- **Example 1:** For input `6 3`, 
  - `x - y = 3`, 
  - Seconds = `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (but we actually need to transform into non-degenerate triangles, which would require more steps).
- **Example 2:** For input `8 5`, 
  - `x - y = 3`,
  - Seconds = `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (again, does not capture the necessary transformations correctly).
- **General Case:** The formula fails to account for the transformations required to maintain the non-degenerate property of the triangle. The triangle sides must remain in equal lengths and cannot drop below certain values until reaching `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem since it doesn't account for the sequence of allowed modifications and the preservation of the non-degenerate triangle condition throughout the transformation. 

Thus, an input such as `(6, 3)` would require 4 seconds (not 2) to achieve the final state through the necessary steps outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
