To analyze the code snippet provided, let's break it down step by step based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, provided `d` is not less than 0.

The code snippet is:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

1. The value of `my` is being assigned a new value calculated from `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. The specific calculation for `my` involves subtracting from `cy` the term `dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

2. The variable `my` has been introduced or updated in this context.

3. The variables `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `d`, `dx`, and `cy` are not altered directly by this assignment; rather, they are used to compute the new value for `my`. 

4. The condition that `d` must not be less than 0 is also valid; if `d` were negative, this expression would be problematic, but since it is assumed to hold for the calculation, we proceed. 

The output state will reflect the newly computed value of `my` while maintaining the preconditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
