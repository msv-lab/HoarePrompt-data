The function accepts two positive integers, N and K, and a list of N tuples (each containing three integers: x_i, y_i, c_i). It reads inputs from the user, constructs the list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The actual operations performed by `func_2` and the final output depend on its implementation, which is not provided.
