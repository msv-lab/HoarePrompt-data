The expression being executed is:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Analyzing the variables involved:

- `cy` is equal to `y1`.
- `dx` is `0`.
- `d2` is `0`.
- `d` is not explicitly defined in the initial conditions, but it remains unchanged.

Substituting these values into the equation leads to a division by zero situation because `d2` is `0`. 

As a result, the calculation for `my` cannot proceed, and it will not be assigned a valid value. 

Since the other variables are unaffected, the output state summarizes all the valid information from the precondition and notes that `my` is not defined due to the division by zero.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `x1`, `cy` is equal to `y1`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0, and `my` is not defined due to division by zero.**
