The variable `mx` is assigned the value of the expression `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2` remain defined according to the initial state, and since `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we can proceed with the calculation using the existing values of these variables. The overall state of the variables that remain unchanged is preserved.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain as defined; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2**.
