Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K` if the loop executes two or more times, and `my` is defined. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains the initial value less than `K`, and `my` is still undefined, which causes an error in the program.**
