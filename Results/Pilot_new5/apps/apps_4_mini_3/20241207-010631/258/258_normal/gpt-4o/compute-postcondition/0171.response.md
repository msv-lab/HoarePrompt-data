The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is inside and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `meats`, `count`, `j`, `N`, and `d` remain unchanged, as no assignments or modifications are made to them.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and must be less than K, `j` is still `i + 2`, `N` is still greater than `i + 2`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`**.
