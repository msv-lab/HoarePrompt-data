The variable `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which means `data` will hold a list of strings that are the result of splitting the input string by whitespace. The initial state of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The specific value of `data` will depend on the user input, which is not predetermined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100; `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input string by whitespace.**
