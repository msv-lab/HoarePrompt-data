To evaluate the given code snippet, we need to update the relevant variables based on the initial state and the effects of executing the code.

1. The variable `my` is assigned a new value calculated from the existing variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 
2. The expression used to calculate `my` is: 
   \[
   my = cy - \frac{dx \cdot \sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}
   \]
3. We know that:
   - `cy` is equal to \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
   - `dx` is equal to \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
   - `d2` is equal to \(dx \cdot dx + dy \cdot dy\)
   - `d` is equal to \((c1 - c2) \cdot T / (c1 \cdot c2)\) and remains negative if \(d < 0\)

The variables `my`, `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` will be affected by the code execution. The other variables remain unchanged.

Finally, we establish the output state reflecting all valid information from the initial state, including the updated value for `my`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and is less than K, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)` and remains negative if `d < 0`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
