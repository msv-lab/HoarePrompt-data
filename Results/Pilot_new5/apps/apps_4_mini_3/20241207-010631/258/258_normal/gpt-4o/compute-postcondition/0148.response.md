The code `continue` does not alter the values of any variables, but it will skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed, proceeding to the next iteration. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, and the current value of `d` is negative (d < 0) while skipping to the next iteration of the loop.
