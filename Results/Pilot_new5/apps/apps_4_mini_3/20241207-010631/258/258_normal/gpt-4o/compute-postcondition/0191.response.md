The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since `c1`, `c2`, and `T` are not explicitly stated, we will express `d` in terms of `c1`, `c2`, and `T`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`.**
