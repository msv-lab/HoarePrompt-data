To determine whether the provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and functionality against the specified problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must determine the optimal time required to have at least K pieces of meat ready for Takahashi to eat, given the coordinates and hardness values of N pieces of meat. The time it takes for each piece to be ready is dependent on where the heat source is placed (represented by coordinates \(X, Y\)) and the hardness of the meat. The goal is to minimize this time.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads the input, which includes the number of pieces of meat \(N\), the required number of pieces \(K\) to be ready, and the list of tuples containing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It then calls `func_2()` to compute the result.

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**: This function implements a binary search algorithm to find the minimum time \(T\). The loop continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than \(1e-7\), ensuring the precision requirement specified in the problem.

3. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**: This function checks whether it's possible to have at least \(K\) pieces of meat ready within time \(T\). It iterates through pairs of pieces of meat to determine potential optimal locations for the heat source. It calculates the distance from the calculated midpoint to each piece of meat and checks if it can cook in time \(T\).

### Correctness Assessment:
- The program uses binary search to narrow down the minimum possible cooking time, which is appropriate for optimization problems.
- The nested loops in `func_1()` correctly check distances and ensure that the conditions for \(K\) pieces of meat being ready are satisfied.
- The final return value is formatted to six decimal places, which aligns with the requirement of having an absolute or relative error of at most \(10^{-6}\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic necessary to solve the problem based on the given description. All components function as intended to meet the requirements of finding the optimal position for the heat source and the associated minimum time.

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem description can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
