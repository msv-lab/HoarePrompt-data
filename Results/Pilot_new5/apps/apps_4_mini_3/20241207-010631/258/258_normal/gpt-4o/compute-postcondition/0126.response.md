The variable `cx` is assigned the value `(x1 + x2) / 2`, which calculates the average of `x1` and `x2`. The values of `meats`, `count`, `j`, `N`, and `d` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include all relevant information while updating only `cx`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
