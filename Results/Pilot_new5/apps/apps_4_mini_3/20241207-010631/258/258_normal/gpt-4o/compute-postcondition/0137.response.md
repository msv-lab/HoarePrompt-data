Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T` and is updated accordingly. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True; otherwise, there is no else part to evaluate.***
