The variable `dy` is assigned the value of (y1 - y2) / 2. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified, but `dy` will result in a value that represents half the difference between `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and must be less than K, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is now equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)` and remains negative if `d < 0, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2.**
