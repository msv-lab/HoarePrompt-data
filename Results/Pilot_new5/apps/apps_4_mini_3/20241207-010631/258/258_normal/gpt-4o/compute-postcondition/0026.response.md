The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided definition. However, it operates on the constraints where `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 60), `K` is a positive integer (1 <= K <= N), and `meats` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) which have specified ranges (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100). 

The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on certain conditions or computations. Unfortunately, the specific output logic and conditions for returning values are not provided in the given description.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 60), a positive integer K (1 <= K <= N), and a list of tuples called meats, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with constraints on their values. The exact return value based on these inputs is not specified.**
