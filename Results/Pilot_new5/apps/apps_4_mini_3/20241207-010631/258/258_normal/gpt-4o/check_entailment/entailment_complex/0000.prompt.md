You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th piece of meat, and c_i is an integer representing the hardness of the i-th piece of meat (1 <= c_i <= 100). K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats). T is a real number representing the time threshold.
def func_1(meats, K, T):

                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K` if the distance condition is satisfied during the iterations; otherwise, `count` is less than `K`. `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are calculated values based on the comparisons within the loop; `mx` and `my` are calculated based on the last valid `d`, `cx`, and `cy` values. If `N` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, leaving `count`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` undefined or at their initial state.
    return False
    #The program returns False because the loop did not execute, leaving count, d, cx, cy, dx, dy, d2, mx, and my undefined or at their initial state, and count is less than K.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of pieces of meat; a positive integer `K`; and a real number `T`. It checks combinations of meat pieces to determine if there exists a midpoint such that the sum of the weights (hardness values) of pieces within a distance `T` from that midpoint is at least `K`. If such a midpoint is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the input list `meats` has one or no elements, the function will also return False immediately, as no pairs can be formed. Additionally, if `K` is greater than the total weight of the pieces, the function will always return False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer within the range 1 to 60, K is an integer within the range 1 to N, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with x_i and y_i in the range -1000 to 1000 and c_i in the range 1 to 100.

        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` is approximately equal to `low`, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to 1e-07; `N` is an integer within the range 1 to 60, `K` is an integer within the range 1 to `N`, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with x_i and y_i in the range -1000 to 1000 and c_i in the range 1 to 100. The values of `low` and `high` converge to a precise interval that cannot be further reduced without exceeding the defined precision.
    return high
    #The program returns the value of 'high', which is approximately equal to 'low', with the difference between 'high' and 'low' being less than or equal to 1e-07, indicating they converge to a precise interval that cannot be further reduced without exceeding the defined precision.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (ranging from 1 to 60), an integer `K` (ranging from 1 to `N`), and a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains three integers representing coordinates and hardness values of meat pieces. It performs a binary search to find a value `high` such that the difference between `high` and a lower bound `low` is less than or equal to 1e-07. The function returns `high`, which indicates a convergence to a precise value based on the conditions evaluated by the unspecified `func_1`. If `func_1` behaves unexpectedly or if `meats` is improperly formatted, the function may not perform as intended.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.

    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples of the form `(x, y, c)`, where each tuple corresponds to the values parsed from `data` at indices 2, 3, 4, ..., 3N-1, 3N, 3N+1, `index` is `2 + 3N`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, N and K, and a list of N tuples (each containing three integers: x_i, y_i, c_i). It reads inputs from the user, constructs the list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The actual operations performed by `func_2` and the final output depend on its implementation, which is not provided.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
