The statement `continue` indicates that the loop in which it resides will skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, no variables are modified or assigned new values during this execution. 

The values of `meats`, `count`, `N`, `k`, `j`, `d`, `c1`, `c2`, and `T` remain unchanged. However, the logic following the `continue` statement is not executed, but the preconditions are still valid.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, with the current value of `d` being less than 0; the loop will skip the rest of the current iteration.**
