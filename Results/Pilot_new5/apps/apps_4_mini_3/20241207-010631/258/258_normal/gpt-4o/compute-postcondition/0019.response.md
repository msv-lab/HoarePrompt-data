The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list containing values, and `index` has previously been increased by 3. The previous values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `index` remain unchanged, but the value of `y` is now determined by the value at position `index + 1` in the `data` list.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 6, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)`, where `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`, `index` is now increased by 3, and `y` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
