The value of `d` is divided by the product of `c1` and `c2`. Since we know that `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, the new value of `d` can be expressed as:

\[ d = \frac{(c1 - c2) * T}{c1 * c2} \]

The states of the other variables are not affected, as the code only modifies the value of `d`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to \((c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)\) if \(d\) is less than 0, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
