The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The variables `x`, `y`, and `c` are assigned specific values extracted from `data`, where `x` is `int(data[6])`, `y` is `int(data[7])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unaffected, and the list `meats` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 5, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is `int(data[7])`, `x` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.**
