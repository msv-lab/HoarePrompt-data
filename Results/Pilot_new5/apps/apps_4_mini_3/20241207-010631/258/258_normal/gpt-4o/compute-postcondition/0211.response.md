Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of pieces of meat; a positive integer `K`; and a real number `T`. It checks combinations of meat pieces to determine if there exists a midpoint such that the sum of the weights (hardness values) of pieces within a distance `T` from that midpoint is at least `K`. If such a midpoint is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the input list `meats` has one or no elements, the function will also return False immediately, as no pairs can be formed. Additionally, if `K` is greater than the total weight of the pieces, the function will always return False.**
