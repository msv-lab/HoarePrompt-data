The variable `cx` is assigned the value of the average of `x1` and `x2`. The previous values of `x1` and `x2` are equal, meaning `cx` will be equal to either one of them. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2.**
