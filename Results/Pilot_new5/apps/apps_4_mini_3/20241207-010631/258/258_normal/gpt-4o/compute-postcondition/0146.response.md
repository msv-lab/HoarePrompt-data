The expression `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` calculates the difference between the product of `c1` and `T` and the product of `c2` and `T`. Since the condition states that `c1 * T < c2 * T`, the result of `d` will be negative.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, and `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, which is negative.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` (which is negative)**.
