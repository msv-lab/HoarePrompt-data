Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[k + 1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]`, and the current value of `c1` multiplied by `T` is less than the current value of `c2` multiplied by `T`.***
