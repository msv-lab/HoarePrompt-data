To determine the output state after executing the given code, we focus on the assignment of the variable `times` from the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since we don't have the specific implementation of `func_2`, we cannot ascertain the exact values returned by it. However, we can summarize the preconditions and the effect of the code.

The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` will be called with `x` as -998 and `y` as -999. The output of this function will determine the values of the variable `times`.

After executing the code, the value of `times` will be assigned the output of the function `func_2`. The other variables remain unchanged as there are no operations affecting them in the provided code snippet.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `times` while maintaining the original constraints for `N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, and `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -999; `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999); `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
