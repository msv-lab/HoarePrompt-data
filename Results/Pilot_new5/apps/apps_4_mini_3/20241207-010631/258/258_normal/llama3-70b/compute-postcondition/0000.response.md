The variable `ans` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `N`, `K`, `x`, or `y`, which remain within their specified ranges. The other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` and `y` are integers within the range -1000 to 1000, and `ans` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` and `y` are integers within the range -1000 to 1000, `ans` is positive infinity**.
