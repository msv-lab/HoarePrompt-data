Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed across all iterations; `times` contains the result of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)` for each `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000.**
