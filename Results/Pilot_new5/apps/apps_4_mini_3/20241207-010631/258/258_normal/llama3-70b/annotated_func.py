#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the two-dimensional plane
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four real numbers, x, y, X, and Y, representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y). There are no edge cases handled in this function, as it will correctly compute the distance for any real number inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of the heat source, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates where the heat source is placed.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from 'meats' with the result of the function 'func_1' applied to the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a heat source, and two real number parameters `X` and `Y`, which are the coordinates where the heat source is placed. It returns a list of values, where each value is the product of a coefficient `c` from `meats` and the result of calling the function `func_1` with the arguments (x, y, X, Y). The behavior of the function depends on the definition of `func_1` and the contents of the `meats` variable. It assumes that `meats` is defined in the scope where this function is called and has a structure that allows for unpacking into `x`, `y`, and `c`. If `meats` is not defined or does not have the expected structure, it will raise an error during execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, x and y are integers within the range -1000 to 1000.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is 1000; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` across all combinations of `x` and `y` from -1000 to 1000; `times` contains the results of `func_2` for each combination of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of the sorted results stored in 'times', which are computed by 'func_2(x, y, x, y)' across all combinations of 'x' and 'y' from -1000 to 1000. The variable 'ans' holds this minimum value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the minimum value from the K-th sorted results computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for all integer combinations of `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000. The function assumes `K` is within a valid range (1 to N) without any checks for its correctness, which could lead to potential errors if `K` exceeds the size of the results returned by `func_2`.
