Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is 1000; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` across all combinations of `x` and `y` from -1000 to 1000; `times` contains the results of `func_2` for each combination of `x` and `y`.**
