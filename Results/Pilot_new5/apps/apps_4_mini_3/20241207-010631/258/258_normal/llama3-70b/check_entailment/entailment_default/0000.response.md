To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the code in conjunction with the output hints.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves determining the optimal placement of a heat source on a two-dimensional plane to grill K pieces of meat, where each piece of meat has specific coordinates and a hardness factor. The time taken for each piece to be ready is proportional to its hardness and the Euclidean distance from the heat source.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Computes the Euclidean distance between two points `(x, y)` and `(X, Y)`.
   - The output hint states that it correctly computes the distance for any real number inputs. This function appears to be correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes the heat source coordinates and calculates the time for each piece of meat to be ready using its hardness and the distance from the heat source.
   - The output hint indicates that it returns a list of times multiplied by hardness but also notes a potential issue if `meats` is not properly defined. However, since `meats` is defined in the scope where `func_2` is called, this seems to be appropriate for the context.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Iterates over a range of integer coordinates for the heat source, computes required grilling times for each piece using `func_2`, sorts those times, and returns the K-th smallest time.
   - The output hint points out an assumption that `K` is within a valid range without checks, which could lead to an IndexError if `K` is larger than the number of pieces of meat or if it is misconfigured.

### Edge Cases
The main edge case that arises is when `K` is set to a value greater than `N`. According to the problem constraints, `K` must be at least 1 and at most `N`. However, if `K` were to exceed `N` (even if inadvertently set in the input), the program would encounter an error when trying to access the K-th element of a list that doesn't have enough elements (especially since it tries to sort and access the K-1 index).

Additionally, if `N` is 1 and `K` is also 1, the program could still work correctly, but this is a case to keep in mind where `K` must be exactly 1.

### Conclusion
Given that there is a lack of validation for the variable `K` within `func_3`, the program fails to handle the case when `K` exceeds `N`. This indicates that there are potential inputs that would cause the program to fail or behave incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not work correctly for all potential cases due to the lack of handling for the scenario where `K` exceeds `N`. An input where `K` is greater than `N` would lead to an IndexError when trying to access the sorted list in `func_3`.
