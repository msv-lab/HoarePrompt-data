The `times` variable is a list that contains a single value, which is the result of the function `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`. The code `times.sort()` sorts this list, which will not change the order since it contains only one element. Therefore, the value of `times` remains unchanged after the sorting operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -1000; `ans` is positive infinity; `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000`.**
