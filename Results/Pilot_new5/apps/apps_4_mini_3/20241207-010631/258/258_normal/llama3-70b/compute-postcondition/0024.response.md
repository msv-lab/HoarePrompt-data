According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop initiates `y` at -1000 and increments it by 1 until it reaches 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` has reached its maximum value of 1000 and can no longer execute since it has exited the loop's defined range.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is -999 before the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented to -998.

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**
