The function does not accept any parameters and returns the minimum value from the K-th sorted results computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for all integer combinations of `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000. The function assumes `K` is within a valid range (1 to N) without any checks for its correctness, which could lead to potential errors if `K` exceeds the size of the results returned by `func_2`.
