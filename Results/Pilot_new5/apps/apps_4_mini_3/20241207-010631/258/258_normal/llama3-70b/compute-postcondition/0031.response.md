To evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we analyze the function call `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

1. The code assigns the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. 
2. The values for `x` and `y` are known, with `x` being -998 and `y` being -1000.
3. The function `func_2` is assumed to return a sorted list with at least `K` elements, which would be used to assign the variable `times`. However, without the specific implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine the actual contents of `times`. 
4. The variable `ans` is not modified directly by the code, but it relies on the value of `times[K - 1]`, which implicitly suggests that the list `times` has at least `K` elements, and thus `ans` will take a new value based on the updated `times`.

Therefore, while we cannot derive the exact content of `times`, we can state that `times` is now the output of the function `func_2` called with `x` and `y`. The other variables `N`, `K`, and `ans` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)` and must have at least K elements, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all iterations.**
