According to the code, the for loop iterates over a range defined by `y` starting from -1000 and going to 1000. The loop will execute as long as `y` remains within this range.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. In the next iteration, `y` will increase by 1. Therefore, it will become -998.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must remain in the range from -1000 to 1000. Since the current value of `y` is -999, in the next iteration, it will be -998, which is still within the valid range.

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**
