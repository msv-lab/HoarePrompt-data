According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). This means that the loop will execute a total of 2001 times, as it includes both endpoints (-1000 and 1000). The values of `N`, `K`, and `ans` are not directly affecting the loop execution since the loop variable `y` is defined by the range provided.

However, `y` will be iterated over, starting from -1000 and ending at 1000. Since the loop's execution does not depend on the values of `N` or `K`, no adjustments to these variables are necessary for this loop to run.

At the start of the loop, `y` will take its first value of -1000. Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `ans` is positive infinity**
