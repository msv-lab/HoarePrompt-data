The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on a range of integer values for `x` and `y`, which are within the range of -1000 to 1000. After executing its internal computations, the function returns the minimum value of the sorted results stored in 'times', which are computed by invoking `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for all combinations of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to determine and return the minimum value from a set of computed results based on the combinations of integers `x` and `y` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the minimum value of the sorted results computed by 'func_2(x, y, x, y)' for all combinations of integers x and y in the range -1000 to 1000.**
