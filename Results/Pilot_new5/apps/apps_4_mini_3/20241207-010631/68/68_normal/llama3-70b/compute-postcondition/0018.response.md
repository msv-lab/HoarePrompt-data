The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on three integer values: `x`, `y`, and `z`, constrained by the conditions that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since there is no detailed behavior or output provided, we cannot specify the return value. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can only state the parameters involved.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters; it operates on three integers x, y, and z, which must be in the range of 0 to 100. The specific output behavior is not defined.**
