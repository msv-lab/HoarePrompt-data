Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `z` is 0, the output '0' is printed, while `x` is equal to `y`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` maintain their relationships such that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, with `x` still equal to `y`.***
