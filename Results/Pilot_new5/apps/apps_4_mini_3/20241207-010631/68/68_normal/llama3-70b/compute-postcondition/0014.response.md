The code `print('?')` does not modify any of the variables or their values. It simply outputs the character `?` to the console. The conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values within the range 0 to 100. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
