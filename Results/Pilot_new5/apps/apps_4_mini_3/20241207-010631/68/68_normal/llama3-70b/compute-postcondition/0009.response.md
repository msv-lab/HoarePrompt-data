The `print('0')` statement outputs the string '0' to the console. Since this is a print statement, it does not alter the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values within the range 0 to 100. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and the current value of `z` is 0. The output '0' has been printed.**
