The code snippet provided simply prints the character '+'. There are no variable assignments or modifications in the code. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. The output state does not include any variable changes but indicates that the character '+' has been printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`); the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z < x`); '+' has been printed.**
