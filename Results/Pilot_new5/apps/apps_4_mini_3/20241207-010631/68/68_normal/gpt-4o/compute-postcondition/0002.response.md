The value of `max_upvotes` is assigned the result of `x + z`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the new value of `max_upvotes` will be the sum of `x` and `z`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
