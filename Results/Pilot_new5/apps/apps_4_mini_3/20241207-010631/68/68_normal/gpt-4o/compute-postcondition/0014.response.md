The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as it is defined without any input arguments. Based on the given constraints that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, the function's output will depend on these values. However, since the output information is missing in the provided details, I will only state the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not provide any output as there is no context for the result.**
