The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
