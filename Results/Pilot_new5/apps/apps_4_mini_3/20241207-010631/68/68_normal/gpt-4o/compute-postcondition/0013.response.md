Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values between 0 and 100. If `max_upvotes` (which equals `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which equals `y`), the output is '-'. Otherwise, if `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, and if `max_downvotes` (which equals `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which equals `x`), then the output is '+'. If neither of these conditions is met, the output is '?' with no change to the variable values.***
