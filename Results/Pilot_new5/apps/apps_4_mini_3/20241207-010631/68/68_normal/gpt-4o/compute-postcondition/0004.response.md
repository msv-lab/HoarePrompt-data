In the given code, `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. 

Prior to the execution of this line, we have:
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values within the range [0, 100].
- `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.
- `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.
- `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

The value of `max_downvotes` is now calculated as `y + z`. Since `y` is already known as one of the inputs and `z` is another input, the value of `max_downvotes` will be the sum of these two values.

Thus, the output state after executing the code will reflect the updated value for `max_downvotes` while preserving the values for the other variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
