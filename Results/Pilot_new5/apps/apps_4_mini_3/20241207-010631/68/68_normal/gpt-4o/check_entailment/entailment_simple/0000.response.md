To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program logic in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` representing:
   - `x`: number of guaranteed upvotes.
   - `y`: number of guaranteed downvotes.
   - `z`: number of uncertain votes, which can either be upvotes or downvotes.

2. We need to determine:
   - If upvotes are greater than downvotes, print "+".
   - If downvotes are greater than upvotes, print "-".
   - If upvotes equal downvotes, print "0".
   - If the presence of uncertain votes (`z`) makes the outcome uncertain, print "?".

### Program Logic:
The program calculates:
- `min_upvotes = x`: The minimum possible upvotes is the guaranteed upvotes.
- `max_upvotes = x + z`: The maximum possible upvotes includes all uncertain votes as upvotes.
- `min_downvotes = y`: The minimum possible downvotes is the guaranteed downvotes.
- `max_downvotes = y + z`: The maximum possible downvotes includes all uncertain votes as downvotes.

The program then evaluates:
- If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`. This means that even in the best-case scenario for upvotes (all uncertain votes are upvotes), there are still fewer upvotes than guaranteed downvotes.
- If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`. This means that even in the worst-case scenario for downvotes (all uncertain votes are downvotes), there are still more upvotes than guaranteed downvotes.
- If neither condition is true, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty in the result.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program handles the case where all uncertain votes could tip the balance either way, thus correctly identifying when the result is uncertain (`'?'`).
- It correctly concludes when one side is definitively dominant (`'+'` or `'-'`) based on the extremes of possible vote outcomes allowed by `z`.

### Edge Cases:
1. When `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the output is `?`, which is correct since the outcome could be either `+` or `-`.
2. When `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`, the output is `-`, which is correct as upvotes are less than downvotes.
3. When `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the output is `+`, which is correct as upvotes exceed downvotes.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows all conditions specified in the problem description and handles all possible edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
