Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn based on the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program considers completing tasks and the corresponding points earned.

1. The `dp` array is structured to store the maximum number of subtasks solved for a given time, but it does not account for the additional point earned for completely solving a task. The program attempts to sum the points from the `dp` array at the end, but it only counts how many tasks can be fully solved (which is not effectively implemented).

2. There's a logical flaw in how the program determines when tasks are completed and how it aggregates points. The condition `if dp[i][M] == i` is intended to count the extra points for completing tasks, but it appears to incorrectly check against `i` instead of considering whether a task was fully solved.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```

The expected output should be `6`, which corresponds to completing all subtasks for one task (4 points) and solving 2 additional subtasks from the remaining tasks (2 points). However, if we simply utilize the `dp` array as implemented, it may not correctly account for this scoring mechanism, leading to a potential miscalculation of the points.

Thus, the program fails to correctly implement the logic for maximizing points according to the problem statement, confirming that it is incorrect.
