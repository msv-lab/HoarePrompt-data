The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variable `j` is 2, so `dp[i][j]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i][1]`. The state of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial conditions, but we specify that `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`, `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][1]`.**
