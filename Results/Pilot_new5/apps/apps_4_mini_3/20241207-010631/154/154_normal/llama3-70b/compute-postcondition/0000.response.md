The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned from the input, which consists of three integers. The specific values depend on the user input but the ranges are already defined: `n` is between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is between 1 and 45 inclusive, and `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9. Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2·10^9 inclusive, and `t` is not defined.**
