Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 3, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `new_value`, where `new_value` is the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
