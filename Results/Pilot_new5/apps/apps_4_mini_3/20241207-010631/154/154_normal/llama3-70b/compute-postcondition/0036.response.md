The line of code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value from the `dp` array at index `[i][j - 1]` to the position `[i][j]`. The variable `j` is given to be 1 initially, so `j - 1` will be 0. The assignment implies that `dp[i][1]` will take the value of `dp[i][0]`.

The initial state specifies that `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` must be at least 1 greater than its current value, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, and `j` is 1. None of these values directly change with the code, but we need to note that the value of `dp[i][1]` will now equal `dp[i][0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` must be at least 1 greater than current `k`, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][1]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` must be at least 1 greater than current `k`, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][1]` is equal to `dp[i][0]**
