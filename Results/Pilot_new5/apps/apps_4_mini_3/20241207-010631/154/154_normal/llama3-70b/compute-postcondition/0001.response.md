The variable `t` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values that are split by whitespace. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged, while `t` now holds a list of integers, the quantity and specific values of which depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state remains valid only for `n`, `k`, and `M`, while defining `t` as a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9 inclusive, `t` is a list of integers created from user input.**
