Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 45), `k` (an integer between 1 and 45), and `M` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9), as well as a list `t` containing `k` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000. It calculates the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items such that their total weight does not exceed `M`, and it prints the sum of the maximum items along with the count of configurations where the total weight equals `M`. The function does not handle cases where `M` is smaller than the smallest item in `t` explicitly, which may result in 0 items being selected.**
