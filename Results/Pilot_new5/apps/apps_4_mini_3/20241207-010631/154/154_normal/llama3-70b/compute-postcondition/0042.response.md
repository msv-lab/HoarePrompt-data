The expression `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i][j]`. It evaluates to the maximum of its current value `dp[i][j]` and the value `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is between 1 and 45
- `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`
- `M` is at least 2
- `t` is a sorted list of integers
- `j` is 2
- `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`

The value of `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the computation involving the values of `dp[i][j]`, `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`, and the increment by 1. 

Since `dp[i][1]` is already known and the specific values of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` depend on the state of the list `t` and the value of `j`, we cannot specify exact new values without knowing those.

However, we know:
- `dp[i][j]` will either remain the same or increase by at least 1, depending on the calculation of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`, `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 2, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`**.
