The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means that the current value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`, effectively carrying over the value from the previous column in the same row of the `dp` table.

The preconditions regarding `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` are unaffected by this assignment, while the state of `dp[i][j]` changes based on the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 3, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
