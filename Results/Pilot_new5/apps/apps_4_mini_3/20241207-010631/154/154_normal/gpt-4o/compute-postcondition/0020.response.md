Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1; `k` is within 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is 0; `time_used` is greater than `M`; `points` is 0; `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`; `subtasks_solved` is 0; `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`; and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0 if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`. Otherwise, the program does not change any of the variables.***
