The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: an integer representing the number of complete tasks, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45.
- `k`: an integer representing the number of subtasks, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 45.
- `M`: a non-negative integer representing some measure, where 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9.
- `t`: a list of `k` integers, where each integer t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask.

After executing the function body, it calculates the highest points based on the completed tasks and subtasks solved, where the points are calculated as `points = n * (k + 1)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list of integers `t`, and return the highest points calculated based on the number of complete tasks and subtasks solved. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the highest points calculated based on the number of complete tasks, where points are equal to n * (k + 1).**
