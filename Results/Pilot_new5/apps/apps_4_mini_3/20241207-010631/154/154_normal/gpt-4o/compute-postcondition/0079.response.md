The value of `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the minimum between the current value of `subtasks_solved` and the expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. Given that `n` is at least 2 and `k` is at least 1, the right side of the minimum function will be non-negative. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after all possible subtasks have been solved, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` remains as stated, `complete_tasks` remains as stated, `subtasks_solved` is updated to be `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`**.
