The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Given that `complete_tasks` is still 0 (as per the initial state), the value of `points` will also be 0, as any number multiplied by 0 is 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, and `points` is 0.**
