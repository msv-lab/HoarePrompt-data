In the provided code snippet, `time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 1 and `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, we can directly substitute those values. The other variables remain unchanged.

The previously mentioned variables are:
- `complete_tasks` is 1
- `total_time_per_task` is `sum(t)`

Thus, `time_used` becomes `1 * sum(t)`, which simplifies to `sum(t)`.

The output state reflects the updated `time_used` while retaining all other variables as they were.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
