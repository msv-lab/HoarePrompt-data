In the provided code snippet, `time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. The variable `complete_tasks` is equal to 2, and `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`. Therefore, `time_used` will be updated to `2 * sum(t)`.

The other variables remain unchanged in this execution. The values of `total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time`, and other variables are still valid after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `2 * sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0**.
