The variable `max_points` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. The variables `points` is equal to `k + 1`, and `subtasks_solved` is 0, so `points + subtasks_solved` equals `k + 1 + 0`, which is `k + 1`. 

Since `max_points` is either its previous value or `k + 1`, we cannot determine an exact new value for `max_points` without knowing its initial value. However, we can express the output state in terms of the variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
