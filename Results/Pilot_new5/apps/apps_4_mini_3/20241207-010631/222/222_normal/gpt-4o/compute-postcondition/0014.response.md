The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that 0 <= k <= 1000. The output of the function is not provided, so there is no further specification on the return value based on the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and a parameter k, which is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).**
