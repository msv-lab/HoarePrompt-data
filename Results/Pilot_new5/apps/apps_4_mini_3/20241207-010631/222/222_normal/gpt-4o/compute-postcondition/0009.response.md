The code `positions.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `positions`. Initially, `positions` is `[1, i]`, where `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`. After executing the code, `positions` will now contain three elements: `1`, `i`, and the new value, which is also `i`. 

Therefore, the updated state of `positions` will reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`, `positions` is [1, `i`, `i`], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3**.
