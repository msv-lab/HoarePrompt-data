The code initializes an empty list named `positions`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, and specifies that `positions` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list**.
