To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately implements the requirements specified.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:

1. **Input Processing**: 
   - The function reads two integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers turned from each side during one action) which is aligned with the problem description.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Actions (`l`)**:
   - The formula used in the program to calculate `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. 
   - This formula correctly computes the minimum number of actions needed to turn all skewers:
     - Each action turns over `2k + 1` skewers (k from each side plus the skewer itself).
     - Therefore, dividing the total number of skewers `n` by `2k + 1` gives the number of complete actions needed.
     - The formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` effectively computes the ceiling of the division without using floating-point arithmetic.

3. **Generating the Indices of Turned Skewers**:
   - The loop `for i in range(l): res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` generates the indices of the skewers that Miroslav should turn over:
     - It starts at `1` (the first skewer) and increments by `2k + 1` each time, which ensures that the next skewer turned is spaced adequately to cover all skewers without overlapping already turned ones.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of actions (`l`) followed by the indices of the skewers that need turning, which is as required by the problem statement.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **When `k = 0`**: Each action only turns over the skewer itself, meaning `l` will be `n` (since we need one action for each skewer). The generated indices will simply be all integers from `1` to `n`.
- **When `n = 1`**: The program should correctly output `1` as the number of actions required, and the output should also list `1` as the skewer turned.
- **General Cases**: For larger values of `n` and `k`, the logic remains consistent, ensuring that all skewers are turned over with the minimum number of actions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles edge cases appropriately, ensuring that all skewers are turned over with a minimum number of actions, based on the inputs provided. Therefore, it meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
