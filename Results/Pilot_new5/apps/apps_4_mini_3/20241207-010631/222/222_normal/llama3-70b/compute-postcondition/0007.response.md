According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to iterate again. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000) such that `n + k >= 2`, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2, `res` is [1, k * 2 + 2]**
