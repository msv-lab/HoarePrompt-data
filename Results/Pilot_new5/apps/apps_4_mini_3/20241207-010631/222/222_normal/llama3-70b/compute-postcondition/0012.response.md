The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of skewers, and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000) representing the number of skewers turned from each side during one action. The function returns a value based on these inputs. 

The specific output behavior is not provided, so I will describe the functionality based on the constraints given. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the values of `n` and `k` that are defined by the constraints and return a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates based on the constraints of a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer k (0 <= k <= 1000), returning a result based on these inputs.**
