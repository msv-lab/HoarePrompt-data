To analyze the impact of the provided code on the initial state, we will determine how `res` is modified based on the values of `i`, `k`, and the constraints given for `n` and `k`.

- The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` will add a new value to the list `res`.
- We know that `i` is initialized to 1.
- `k` is a non-negative integer, so `k * 2` will also be non-negative, thus `(k * 2 + 1)` will always be at least `1`.
- Consequently, `i * (k * 2 + 1)` will be equal to `k * 2 + 1` since `i` is `1`.
- Therefore, the expression simplifies to `k * 2 + 1 + 1`, which is `k * 2 + 2`.
- The modified `res` list will now include this new calculated value.

The previously valid values of the preconditions remain unchanged:

- `n` is still an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000).
- `k` is still a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000) such that `n + k >= 2`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `l` must still be greater than 1.
- `res` now becomes `[1, k * 2 + 2]`.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000) such that `n + k >= 2`, `i` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1, `res` is [1, k * 2 + 2]**.
