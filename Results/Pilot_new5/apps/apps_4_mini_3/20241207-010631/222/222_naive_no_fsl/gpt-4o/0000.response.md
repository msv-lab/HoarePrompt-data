To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have `n` skewers, and when we turn over a skewer at position `i`, it also turns over `k` skewers on either side of `i`.
   - The goal is to turn over all skewers using the minimum number of actions.

2. **Input and Output Requirements**: 
   - The first line of input consists of two integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers turned from each side).
   - The output should be the minimum number of actions needed and the specific skewer positions that were turned over.

3. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1(n, k)`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `positions` to store the skewer positions to be turned over.
   - The program uses a while loop to append skewer positions to `positions`. It starts at position `1` and increments `i` by `2 * k + 1` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it prints the number of positions and the list of positions.

4. **Testing the Logic**:
   - The logic for choosing turning positions is as follows: starting from position `1`, it jumps to `1 + (2*k + 1)`, effectively skipping over the skewers that will be turned by the previous action. 
   - For example, with `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the first position turned is `1`, which turns skewers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` (turning `1` turns over `1` through `5`), and the second will be `6`, which turns `6, 7`.
   - This approach could lead to situations where some skewers remain unturned.

5. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`. The expected output is `1` (turning skewer `1`), but the program outputs `1` and `1`, which is correct.
   - Now consider `n = 5` and `k = 1`. The output can be `1 4`, but turning `0` would not work since `2` would remain unturned. The program's logic allows for the possibility of missing skewers when `k < n/2`.

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - Based on the analysis, the program fails to guarantee that all skewers will be turned over in every scenario, particularly when `k` is less than `n/2`. Thus, it is possible for some skewers to remain in their initial state.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not always turn over all skewers, especially in cases where `k` is relatively small compared to `n`. For instance, with `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the skewer `3` can remain unturned if the selected positions are not optimal.
