The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input`, where the input consists of space-separated integers that are mapped to the respective variables. Since `n` and `m` are even integers in the range [2, 10^9], and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m, the specific values after the assignment will depend on the input provided. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9], `m` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9], `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m.**
