Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is equal to either `n - full_rows` or an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is equal to either `2 + remaining_steps` or `m - remaining_steps` depending on the parity of `full_rows`. The values of `row` and `col` have been printed.**
