The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. Both `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times m\). The function returns a value based on the relationship and constraints of these parameters. However, the specific return value based on the conditions has not been detailed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two even integers `n` and `m`, along with a non-negative integer `k`, while ensuring that `k` is within the specified bounds related to `n` and `m`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (even integers ≥ 2) and k (a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m).**
