To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the impact of the code snippet on the provided initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq k < n \cdot m - (n - 1) \).
- `full_rows` is an odd integer.
- `row` is equal to \( n - full_rows \), which is an odd integer.

The code snippet provided is:
```
col = m - remaining_steps
```

In this code, the variable `col` is assigned the value of `m - remaining_steps`. However, the variable `remaining_steps` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot derive a specific value for `col`. We only know that `col` will depend on the undefined value of `remaining_steps`.

Since the values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, and `row`) remain unchanged, the output state reflects the assignment made to `col` while noting that `remaining_steps` is an undefined variable. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is an odd integer, `row` is an odd integer equal to n - full_rows, `col` is equal to m - remaining_steps.**
