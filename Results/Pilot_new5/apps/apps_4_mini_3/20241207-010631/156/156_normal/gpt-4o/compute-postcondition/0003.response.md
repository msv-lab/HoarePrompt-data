The impact of the code on the program is that `k` is decremented by `n - 1`. The initial state states that `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the value of `k` after the operation will still satisfy the condition `0 <= k < n * m` but will be reduced by `n - 1`. The specific new value for `k` can be expressed as `k - (n - 1)`.

Since `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `n - 1` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1. Thus, `k` will be reduced by at least 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1)**
