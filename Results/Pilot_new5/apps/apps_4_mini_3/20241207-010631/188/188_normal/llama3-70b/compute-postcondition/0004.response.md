According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop condition allows `i` to iterate from 0 up to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, the loop can execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 1 (it is at least 2), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` contains the input integer**
