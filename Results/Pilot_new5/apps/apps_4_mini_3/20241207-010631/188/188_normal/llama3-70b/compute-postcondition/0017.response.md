The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. It is given that `d` must either already contain the key `i` with value 1 or have added the key `i` with value 1. Therefore, if `i` was already in `d`, its value would increase from 1 to 2. If `i` was added with value 1, then it would now be 2 as well. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `d[i]` is now 2 while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next element from the list `a`, `d` contains key `i` with value 2.**
