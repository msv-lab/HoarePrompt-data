The variable `a` will contain the result of `a.append(int(input()))`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code, and `i` is also not affected. The list `a`, which was initially empty, now holds one additional integer, which is the input provided by the user.

Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 and `i` is 0, the output state will reflect that `a` now contains the newly appended integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` contains the input integer**
