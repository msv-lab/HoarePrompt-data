The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, `c` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
