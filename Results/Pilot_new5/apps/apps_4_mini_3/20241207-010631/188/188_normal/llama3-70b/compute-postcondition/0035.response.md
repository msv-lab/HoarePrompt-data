Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, and `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d` with `d[i]` equal to `n // 2`. If `c` is equal to 0, then `c` is set to 1 and `a1` is equal to `i`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `a2` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
