Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is the first key in `d` for which `d[a1]` equals `n // 2` if such a key exists; otherwise, `a1` remains -1. `a2` is the second key in `d` for which `d[a2]` equals `n // 2` if such a key exists; otherwise, `a2` remains -1. If no keys in `d` have a value of `n // 2`, then both `a1` and `a2` remain -1.**
