The statement `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is not a key in dictionary `d` before this operation, it will be created with the value `1`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the value taken from the list `a`, and now `d` contains the key `i` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the value taken from `a`, `d` contains key `i` with value `1`.**
