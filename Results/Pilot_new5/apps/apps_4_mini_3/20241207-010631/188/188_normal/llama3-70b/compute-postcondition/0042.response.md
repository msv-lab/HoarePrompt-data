Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, and `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`. If `c` is equal to 0, then `a1` is set to the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
