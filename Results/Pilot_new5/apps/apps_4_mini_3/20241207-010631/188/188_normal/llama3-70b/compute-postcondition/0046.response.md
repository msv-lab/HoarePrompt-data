The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown, so the output state reflects the change in `c`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, `c` is incremented by 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is unchanged**
