Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, and `c` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is set to `i`, while `a2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0, then `a1` remains unchanged, `a2` is set to `i`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
