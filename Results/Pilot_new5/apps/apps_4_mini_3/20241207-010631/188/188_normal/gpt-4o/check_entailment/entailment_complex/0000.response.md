Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it only checks if there are two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n // 2` times to determine if the game is fair. This is a very restrictive condition and does not cover all the necessary scenarios. 

In particular, it fails in the following cases:

1. If there are two distinct integers where one appears `n // 2` times and the other appears more than `n // 2` times, the game could still be made fair by choosing the correct integers. The current implementation would return 'NO' in such cases, even though a fair game may be possible.

2. The program does not handle cases where there are more than two distinct integers. If there are multiple integers, any two of them could form a fair game as long as they each appear enough times to split the cards equally.

3. The check for the length of `unique_numbers` being less than 2 is correct, but the subsequent logic does not allow for valid distributions of cards beyond the strict condition of exactly equal counts of the two most frequent integers.

For example, consider the following case:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  1
  1
  2
  2
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  YES
  1 2
  ```
- Actual Output from the program:
  ```
  YES
  1 1
  ```
In this scenario, the program would incorrectly identify the same number multiple times as valid, which does not satisfy the requirement for distinct integers.

Overall, the program does not accurately capture the conditions under which the game is fair according to the problem description. Thus, it cannot be considered correct.
