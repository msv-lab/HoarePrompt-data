The variable `unique_numbers` is assigned the value of the sorted keys of the `count` object, which represents the unique integers from the `cards` list, sorted based on their frequency in ascending order. The `n` value remains unchanged as it only defines the range for the `cards` list and does not affect the sorting operation. The `count` object still represents the frequency of each integer in `cards`, but now we have the sorted unique integers.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in ascending order.**
