Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in ascending order. The length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. The count of the most frequent integer (`unique_numbers[-1]`) is equal to `n // 2`, and the count of the second most frequent integer (`unique_numbers[-2]`) is also equal to `n // 2.***
