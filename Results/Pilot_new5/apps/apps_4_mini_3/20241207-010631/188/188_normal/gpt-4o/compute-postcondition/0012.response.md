Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in ascending order; the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. If the count of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer both equal `n // 2`, then 'YES' is printed along with the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
