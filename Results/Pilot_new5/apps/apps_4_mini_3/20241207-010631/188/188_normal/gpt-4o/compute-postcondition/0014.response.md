The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer in the range [2, 100]. Additionally, it accepts `n` subsequent integers, denoted as `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, each of which is in the range [1, 100]. 

The function does not explicitly return any output in the provided context. Therefore, to summarize the functionality based on the constraints provided:

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n in the range [2, 100] and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in the range [1, 100].**
