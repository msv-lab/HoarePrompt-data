The provided program attempts to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose two distinct integers such that they can split the n cards evenly between them. Letâ€™s analyze the logic step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (which is guaranteed to be even) and then reads `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each unique integer on the cards.

3. **Check Unique Numbers**: The program then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If not, it prints "NO" since they need to choose two distinct integers.

4. **Checking Fairness**: If there are at least two unique numbers, it checks if the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times. If they do, it prints "YES" followed by those two numbers. If not, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation:
- The program checks for **at least two distinct numbers**: This meets the requirement of the problem description that Petya and Vasya must choose distinct integers.
- The program checks the frequencies of the two most common numbers to ensure they can each take half of the cards. This is crucial because for the game to be fair, they need to be able to split all `n` cards equally, which is also required by the problem description.
- However, there is a logical flaw: the program only checks the two most frequent numbers and assumes that these are the only candidates for making the game fair. There might be other combinations of distinct numbers that could also satisfy the conditions (e.g., if there are three distinct numbers, one could have `n // 2` cards of any two of those distinct numbers).

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for scenarios where there could be other valid pairs of distinct integers aside from the two most frequent ones. Therefore, it can potentially miss valid outputs or incorrectly assert that a game can't be fair when it actually can be.

**Correctness: False**
