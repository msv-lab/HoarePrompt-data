Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether Petya and Vasya can have a fair game. Specifically, the logic that checks for having exactly two distinct integers with each appearing exactly `n/2` times is flawed. 

The following example illustrates a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1
1
2
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
1 2
```

**Actual Behavior of the Program:**
- The program will create a dictionary `d` that counts the occurrences of each number. For this input, `d` would be `{1: 2, 2: 2}`.
- The program then looks for two distinct numbers that each occur exactly `n/2` times (which is 2 in this case).
- It will find `1` and `2`, and it will print "YES" and "1 2". However, it will actually work for this case.

But letâ€™s consider another example:

**Input:**
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Behavior of the Program:**
- The program counts occurrences and finds that `1`, `2`, and `3` each appear twice. 
- However, it does not realize that there is no possibility for Petya and Vasya to choose distinct integers and still distribute all cards evenly.

In a broader sense, the logic should ensure that:
1. There are exactly two distinct integers in total.
2. Each integer must appear exactly `n/2` times.

Thus, the program incorrectly assumes that two numbers can be chosen even when there are more than two distinct numbers present that share the same count. 

This means the logic is not robust enough to handle all potential edge cases as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is not correct for all inputs.
