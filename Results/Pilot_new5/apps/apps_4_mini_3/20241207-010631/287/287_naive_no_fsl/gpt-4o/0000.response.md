Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly calculates the number of distinct weights of splits for a given integer `n`. Instead of finding the weights of splits, it counts the number of divisors of `n`. 

For example:

- For `n = 7`, the expected output is `4`, since the weights of the splits are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`. However, the program counts the divisors of `7`, which are `1` and `7`, giving an output of `2`.

- For `n = 8`, the expected output is `5`, but the program would again count the divisors of `8`, resulting in an output of `4`.

This shows that the program does not fulfill the requirement to count distinct weights of splits; thus, it is incorrect.
