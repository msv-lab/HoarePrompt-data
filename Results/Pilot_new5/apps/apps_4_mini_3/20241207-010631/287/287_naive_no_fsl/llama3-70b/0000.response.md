Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \). Instead, it appears to be calculating the number of divisors of \( n \), which is unrelated to the problem description.

To illustrate the incorrectness, let's consider the input \( n = 8 \):
- According to the problem description, the valid splits of \( 8 \) include:
  - Weight 1: [8]
  - Weight 2: [4, 4]
  - Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
  - Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
  - Weight 5: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This gives a total of 5 different weights for the splits of \( 8 \).

However, the program counts the number of divisors of \( 8 \), which are \( 1, 2, 4, 8 \), thus returning \( 4 \) which is incorrect according to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, since the program fails to satisfy the problem description for the input \( n = 8 \), it is incorrect.
