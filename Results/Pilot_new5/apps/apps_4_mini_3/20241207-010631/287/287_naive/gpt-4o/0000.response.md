To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of different weights of splits of a number `n`.
- A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`.
- The weight of a split is the count of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

### Given Program:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The function `func_1(num)` calculates the number of divisors of `num` and seems to be counting these divisors. 
2. In the context of the problem, the number of different weights of splits of `n` is not directly related to the number of divisors of `n`. The weight concept relates to how many times the largest number appears in possible splits of `n`, not the divisors of `n`.
3. The logic used to find the divisors (counting pairs of divisors) does not address how to find the actual weights of splits.
4. Therefore, the function does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

### Example of Failure:
For `n = 7`, the expected output of different weights is `4`, but the function counts divisors instead. This means it does not capture the essence of the problem, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program, the function will not return the correct number of different weights for splits. 

Correctness: **False**.
