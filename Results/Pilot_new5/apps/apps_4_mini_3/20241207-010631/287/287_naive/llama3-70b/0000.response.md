To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. 

### Program Analysis:
The given program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

- The program counts the divisors of \( n \) and assigns a value to `res` based on the divisor count.
- For each divisor \( i \):
  - It increments `res` by 2 for each divisor found (counting both \( i \) and \( n/i \)).
  - If \( i \) is the square root of \( n \), it decreases `res` by 1 (to avoid double counting).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Interpretation**: The interpretation of splits is not being addressed correctly. The provided implementation seems to equate weights with the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not aligned with the definition of splits and their weights.
   
2. **Missing Logic**: The program does not clearly compute the different weights of splits based on the problem description. For example, for \( n = 8 \), the correct distinct weights of splits should be determined by examining the possible splits:
   - Weights of splits for \( 8 \) are: 
     - Weight 1: [8]
     - Weight 2: [4, 4]
     - Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
     - Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
     - Weight 5: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
     - Weight 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   - This results in distinct weights {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which counts to 5.

3. **Wrong Output**: The program does not account for the actual valid splits and their respective weights, thus producing incorrect outputs for many values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. It fails to compute and return the distinct weights of the splits of \( n \) correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure:
For \( n = 8 \), the program outputs `6` (as it counts the divisors incorrectly) instead of the correct number of distinct weights, which is `5`.
