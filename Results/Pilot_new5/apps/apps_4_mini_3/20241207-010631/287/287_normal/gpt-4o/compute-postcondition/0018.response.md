The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 5, so after the execution of `count += 1`, the new value of `count` becomes 6. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 9; `count` is 6; `i` is 3.

Output State: **`num` must be at least 9; `count` is 6; `i` is 3**
