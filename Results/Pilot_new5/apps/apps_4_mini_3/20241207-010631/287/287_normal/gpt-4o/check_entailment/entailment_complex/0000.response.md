Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, which involves counting the various ways `n` can be expressed as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers. Specifically, the program should be identifying weights based on the occurrences of the largest element in each valid split.

However, the function `func_1` instead counts the total number of divisors of the integer `num`. This is unrelated to the problem of finding split weights. 

For example, for `n = 8`, the valid splits include `[8]`, `[5, 3]`, `[4, 4]`, `[4, 2, 2]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, etc. The weights correspond to how many times the largest number appears in these splits. The program does not provide that information; it simply counts divisors.

Therefore, the program fails to solve the problem as required, as it does not compute the weights of the splits correctly.
