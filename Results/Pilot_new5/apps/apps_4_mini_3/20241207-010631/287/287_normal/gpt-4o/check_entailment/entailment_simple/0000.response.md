Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \), where a weight is defined as the number of elements in a split that are equal to the first element. 

However, the implemented function `func_1(num)` calculates the total number of divisors of the integer \( num \). This is unrelated to the task of determining the different weights of splits for the integer \( n \), which is a completely different problem. 

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following:

1. For the input \( n = 7 \), the splits and their respective weights are:
   - Weight 1: \([7]\)
   - Weight 2: \([3, 3, 1]\)
   - Weight 3: \([2, 2, 2, 1]\)
   - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
   Thus, the different weights of splits are 1, 2, 3, and 7. This gives a total of 4 different weights.

2. The program, however, would return the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (the divisors being 1 and 7).

Hence, the function does not solve the problem as required and provides results that are not aligned with the problem's expectations.
