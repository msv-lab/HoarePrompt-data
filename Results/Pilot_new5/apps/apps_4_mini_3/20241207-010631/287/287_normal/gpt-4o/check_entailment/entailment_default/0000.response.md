The problem description requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a number \( n \). However, the provided Python program calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) instead. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - A split of \( n \) is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum to \( n \).
   - The weight of a split is determined by the count of the first element in that split.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(num)` counts the number of divisors of `num` rather than calculating the weights of splits. This is a fundamental deviation from the problem requirements.

3. **Output Hints Analysis**:
   - The output hints describe the function as counting the total number of divisors of `num`, which aligns with what the function is doing but does not align with the problem description. The hints clarify that the function accurately counts divisors but do not address the requirement of calculating weights of splits.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not implement the logic to find the weights of splits as required by the problem description, it fails to fulfill the fundamental requirement. There are no conditions, edge cases, or examples where the program correctly implements the requested functionality.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not follow the problem description as it calculates the number of divisors instead of the different weights of splits for the number \( n \).
