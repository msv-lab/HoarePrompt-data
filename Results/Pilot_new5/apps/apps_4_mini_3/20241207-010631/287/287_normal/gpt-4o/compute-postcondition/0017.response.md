The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `count` is increased to 4 if `num` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), it indicates that the initial value of `count` could have been 3 (if `num` is divisible by `i`) or lower (if not). After executing the line `count += 1`, the value of `count` will now be at least 4 or increased from whatever its previous value was. 

Since `num` is at least 9 and `i` is 3, we can conclude that `num` is indeed divisible by `i`. Therefore, `count` would start from 4 and will be incremented to 5. 

The states of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` must be at least 9; `count` is 5; `i` is 3**
