The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` becomes 2. The other variables, `num` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is not equal to `num // i`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `num // i`.**
