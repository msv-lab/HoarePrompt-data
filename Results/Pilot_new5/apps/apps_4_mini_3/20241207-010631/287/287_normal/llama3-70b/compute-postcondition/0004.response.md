`res` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after the operation, `res` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is divisible by `i`.**
