To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the range in the for loop, which is defined as `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`. 

1. The variable `n` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. This ensures that `n` is at least 1.
2. The expression `int(n ** 0.5)` calculates the integer square root of `n`. Therefore, if `n` is at least 1, `int(n ** 0.5)` will also be at least 1. Consequently, `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` will be at least 2.
3. The starting point of the range is 1. This means `i` will take values starting from 1 up to `int(n ** 0.5)` inclusive.

Given that `n` is positive and within the specified range, and since `n` is set beforehand, the loop will execute at least once because the range will start at 1 and will include at least one integer (1) if `n` is within the specified limits.

Since `res` is initialized to `0`, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Thus, the adjusted states need to confirm that:
- `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, which it already is.
- The initial value of `i` must be set to 1 as it is the first value that will be used in the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
