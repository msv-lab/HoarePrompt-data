According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates `n` times, and each iteration is represented by the variable `_`, which is always incremented by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, which indicates the loop has just started its first iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 1 before the next iteration, meaning `_` is now 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain unchanged and still be greater than `_`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute for a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `_` is 1, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string**
