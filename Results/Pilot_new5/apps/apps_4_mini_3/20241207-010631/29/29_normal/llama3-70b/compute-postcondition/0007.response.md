The `files` variable, which contains a tuple of `(name, int(type_))`, is updated by appending a new tuple to it. The `name` is an input string and `type_` is an input string that gets converted to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation modifies it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains one additional tuple `(name, int(type_))` where `name` is an input string and `type_` is converted to an integer.**
