The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. The `name` variable is a string obtained from input, and `type_` is converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, which does not change with this operation, and `files` will now include the new tuple. The previous values of `files` are not specified, but it can be assumed that it contained at least one tuple before this operation.

The output state reflects that `files` now contains an additional tuple, and it will describe the current state of `files` after the addition. The variable `n` remains unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) greater than 1; `files` contains one additional tuple `(name, int(type_))`**.
