The code sorts the list `files` based on the second element of each tuple (the `type_` integer) in descending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `files` is modified to reflect the sorting based on file types.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (the `type_` integer).**
