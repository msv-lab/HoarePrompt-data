The code initializes `files` as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is an empty list.**
