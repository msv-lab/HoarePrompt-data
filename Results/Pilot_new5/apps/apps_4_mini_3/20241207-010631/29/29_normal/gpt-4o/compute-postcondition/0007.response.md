The code `regulars.append(name)` adds the variable `name` to the list `regulars`. The previous state of `regulars` was an empty list, and after this operation, it will contain at least one item (the value of `name`). The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, and the condition that `type_` is not equal to '1' is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` contains `name`, and `type_` is not equal to '1'.**
