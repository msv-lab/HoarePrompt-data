The value of `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which is a positive integer since `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, `examples[i]` is now `str(2 * n + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `moves` has a new entry `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` appended to it, and `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`.**
