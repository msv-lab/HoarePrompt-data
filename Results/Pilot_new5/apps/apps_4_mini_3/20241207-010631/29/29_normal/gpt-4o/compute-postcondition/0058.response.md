To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop:

1. The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The loop also continues if `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1.
- It is stated that `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, which means `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Additionally, it is mentioned that `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, we need to ensure that these conditions hold true for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `temp_counter` was equal to `2 * n`, it cannot increment anymore without exceeding.
2. If `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, then it can't continue either.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, we can adjust the state of `temp_counter` in such a way that it is less than `2 * n` and ensure that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`.

Assuming the minimal adjustment is needed:
- We only need to specify that `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n` and that `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` must be less than 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`**
