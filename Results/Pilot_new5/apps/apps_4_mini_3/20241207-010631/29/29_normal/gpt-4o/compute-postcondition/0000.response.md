The code initializes `examples` as an empty list. The variable `n` retains its previous value as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the list `files` is still defined as containing tuples of filenames and their types, which have not been changed by the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and lowercase English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (a string "1" for example tests and "0" for regular tests), `examples` is an empty list.**
