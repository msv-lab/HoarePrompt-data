The code snippet initializes an empty list `moves`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` contains the names of all files where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', and `moves` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` contains the names of all files where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list.**
