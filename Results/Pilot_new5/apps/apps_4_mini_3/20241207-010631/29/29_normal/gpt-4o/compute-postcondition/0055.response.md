The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. After the operation, `temp_counter` will be one greater than its previous value, but the exact previous value is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, while still being in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.**
