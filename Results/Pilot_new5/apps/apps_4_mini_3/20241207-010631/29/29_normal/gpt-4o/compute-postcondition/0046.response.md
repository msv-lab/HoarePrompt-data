The code appends a formatted string to the list `moves`, incorporating the value of `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is derived from the expression `2 * n + k`, where `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is the number of successful increments.

Since the code does not change the values of `n` or `k`, we maintain their previous definitions. The list `moves` is updated by adding a new entry.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + k`, where `k` is the number of successful increments and `moves` now includes an entry `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`.**
