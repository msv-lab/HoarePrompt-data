The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is between `n + 1` and `2 * n`, which means it can take on values from `n + 1` to `2 * n`. Therefore, after the increment, `temp_counter` will now be between `n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
