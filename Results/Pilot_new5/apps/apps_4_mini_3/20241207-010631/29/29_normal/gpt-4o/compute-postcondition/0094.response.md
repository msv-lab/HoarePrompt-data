Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}', `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `2 * n + i + 1`; the loop executed as long as `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set`, indicating that `temp_counter` reached `2 * n + 1` without finding any corresponding string in `files_set` at or after that point.**
