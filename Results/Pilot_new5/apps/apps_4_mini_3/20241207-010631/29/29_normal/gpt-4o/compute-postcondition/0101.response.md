Postcondition: ***`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, and if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` is updated to include 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + i + 1}', while `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`.***
