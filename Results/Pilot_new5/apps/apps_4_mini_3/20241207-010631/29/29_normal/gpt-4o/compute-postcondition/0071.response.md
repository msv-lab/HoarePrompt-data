Postcondition: ***`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` is a list of all move operations performed, `temp_counter` is the next available number after the maximum processed index, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.***
