To analyze the output state of the program after the while loop has executed, we consider the information provided in the initial state and the state changes described after the loop executes multiple times.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to str(i + 1).

From the provided output states after loop execution:

1. **After 1 iteration**: 
   - `temp_counter` becomes `n + 2`.
   - `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

2. **After 2 iterations**: 
   - `temp_counter` must contain `str(n + 2)`.
   - `temp_counter` increases by 1 again.

3. **After 3 iterations**: 
   - `temp_counter` must now be less than or equal to `2 * n` and must contain `str(temp_counter)`.
   - `temp_counter` keeps updating to `temp_counter + 1`.

Now, let's summarize what is true after the loop has executed:

- The loop continues to execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `temp_counter` converted to a string exists in `files_set`.
- Assuming the loop executed until `temp_counter` reached the value where it can no longer satisfy the while condition, we can conclude that:
  - When the loop terminates, `temp_counter` must be equal to `2 * n + 1` (the first value that fails the condition).
  - The values of the `files_set` must include all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).**
