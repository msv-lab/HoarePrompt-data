The variable `moves` is modified by appending a new string formatted as `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`. The value of `temp_counter` is used directly in this operation. The precondition states that `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, and that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Since no value of `temp_counter` is specified, we keep its range. Additionally, the variable `moves` is updated to include the new movement instruction but remains unspecified in the output state.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `moves` includes the string `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
