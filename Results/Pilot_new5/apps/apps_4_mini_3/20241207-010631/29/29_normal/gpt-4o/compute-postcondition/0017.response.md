The `regulars` list is updated by appending the `name` variable, which is derived from the strings in the `files` list of tuples. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer with a possible range from 1 to 100,000, `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, and `name` is the first part of the string in the `file` after splitting.

Since only the `regulars` list is impacted by this code line (with the specific value of `name` being appended), the output state will maintain all previous details while specifically indicating that `name` has been added to `regulars`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the string in `file` after splitting, and `regulars` now includes `name`.**
