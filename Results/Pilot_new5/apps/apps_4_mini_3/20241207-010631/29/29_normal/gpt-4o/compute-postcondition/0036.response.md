The code appends a new entry to the `moves` list with the format `move {examples[i]} {i + 1}`. The value of `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`, and since the condition holds true, we can infer that `i + 1` will be an integer that is 1 greater than the index `i`. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Let's analyze the new entry being appended:
- The value `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`.
- The value for `i + 1` is simply the next integer after `i`.

The `moves` list will now include a new entry based on these values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, and `moves` now includes a new entry `move str(2 * n + 1) {i + 1}`.**
