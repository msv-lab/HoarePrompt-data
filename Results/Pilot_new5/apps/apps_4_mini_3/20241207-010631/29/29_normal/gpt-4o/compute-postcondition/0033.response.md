The value of `temp_counter` is increased by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` was `2 * n + 1`, so after the increment, it becomes `2 * n + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `moves` has a new entry `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` appended to it, and `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`**.
