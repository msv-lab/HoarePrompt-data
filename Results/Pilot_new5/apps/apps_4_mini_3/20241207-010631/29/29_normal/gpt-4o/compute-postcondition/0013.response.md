Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `files` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is adjusted to include `name`, and `regulars` is adjusted according to the type. Otherwise, `examples` is adjusted according to the type, and `regulars` now includes `name`.***
