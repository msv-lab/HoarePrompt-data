Postcondition: ***`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is still 0, the current value of `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. Therefore, `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)` and `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`.***
