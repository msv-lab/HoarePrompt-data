The operation `examples.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the `examples` list. Other variables remain unchanged. The state of the variables is as follows: `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` continues to be a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `examples` now contains the `name` value, `regulars` remains an empty list, and `type_` remains '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that contains at least 1 tuple, `examples` contains `name`, `regulars` is an empty list, and `type_` is '1'.**
