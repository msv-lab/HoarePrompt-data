The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was initially `n + 1`, after the increment it becomes `n + 2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
