The loop continues to execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is found in `files_set`. Since `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, the loop will iterate starting from `temp_counter`'s original value until it reaches `n + 1` (if `temp_counter` started at or below that) or until it hits a value that is no longer in `files_set`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- The `temp_counter` will be equal to `2 * n + 1` because it increments until it exceeds the upper limit of `2 * n`.
- The string representation of `temp_counter` will no longer be in `files_set`, thus stopping the loop.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` is a list of all move operations performed, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is still 0, `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.**
