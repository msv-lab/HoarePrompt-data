Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the string in `file` after splitting, and `type_` is the second part of the string in `file` after splitting. If `type_` is '1', `examples` now includes `name` appended to its previous contents. Otherwise, `regulars` now includes `name`.***
