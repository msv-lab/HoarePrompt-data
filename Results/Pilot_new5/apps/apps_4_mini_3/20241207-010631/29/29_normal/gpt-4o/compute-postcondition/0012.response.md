The `regulars` list will have the `name` appended to it. The initial state indicates that `files` contains at least one tuple, which allows `name` to be defined as the first part of the split string from that tuple. Since no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect the updated `regulars` list with `name` included. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 more tuple, `name` is the first part of the split string from the tuple in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the split string from the tuple in `files`, `examples` is adjusted according to the type, `regulars` now includes `name`.**
