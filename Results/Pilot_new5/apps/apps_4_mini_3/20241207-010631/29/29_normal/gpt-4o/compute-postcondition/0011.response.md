The variable `name` is assigned the first part of the split string from the tuple in `files`. By appending `name` to the `examples` list, we are adding a new element to that list. The values of `n`, `files`, `type_`, `examples`, and `regulars` remain unchanged, except for the `examples` list, which now includes the value of `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 more tuple, `name` is the first part of the split string from the tuple in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the split string from the tuple in `files`, `examples` is adjusted to include `name`, and `regulars` is adjusted according to the type.**
