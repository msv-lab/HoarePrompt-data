In the provided code, `ans.append(n)` adds the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. The value of `n` is 2, so the list `ans` will now contain the additional value 2.

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `n` is 2, `ans` is a list containing 1 and 2.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is 2, `ans` is a list containing 1 and 2**
