According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute one more time regardless of the program state. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to the state for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1**
