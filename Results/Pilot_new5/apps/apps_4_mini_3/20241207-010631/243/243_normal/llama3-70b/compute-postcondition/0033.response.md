In the provided code, the line `ans.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is 3, it will append 3 to the list which currently contains the numbers 1 and 2.

After executing the code, the updated state of the variables will be:
- `count` remains 0,
- `n` is still 3,
- `ans` is now the list containing 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is 3, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3**.
