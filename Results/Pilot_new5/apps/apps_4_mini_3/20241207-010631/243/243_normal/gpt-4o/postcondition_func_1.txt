The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, as determined by the auxiliary function `func_1`. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list. The code effectively finds the range of integers yielding the specified number of trailing zeroes but relies on `func_1`, whose specific implementation and behavior are not provided, which could affect the results.
