The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1; func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1; func_1(left)` must equal `m.**
