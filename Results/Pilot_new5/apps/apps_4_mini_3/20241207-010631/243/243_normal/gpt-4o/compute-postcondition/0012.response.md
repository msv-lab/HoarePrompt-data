The code assigns an empty list to the variable `result`. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.**
