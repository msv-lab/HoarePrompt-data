To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. 

1. The variable `left` is initialized to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.
2. The function `func_1(left)` must return exactly `m` for the loop to execute.
3. The current state shows that `zeroes` (the return value of `func_1(mid)`) is less than or equal to `m`, but this does not provide direct information about `func_1(left)`.
4. Since `left` is initialized based on `m`, the return value of `func_1(left)` needs to be adjusted to equal `m` for the loop to run.

Considering that `func_1(left)` currently does not guarantee to equal `m`, we need to ensure that the function `func_1(left)` returns exactly `m`. This can be achieved by modifying `left` or altering the conditions under which `func_1` operates.

Thus, the necessary adjustment to ensure the loop can execute at least once is:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` must be adjusted so that func_1(left) == m.**
