The code assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `right`. Given that `mid` was previously calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, the new value of `right` will be `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`. The rest of the state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1.**
