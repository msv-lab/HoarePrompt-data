The variable `zeroes` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1(mid)`. The value of `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, and `mid` remain unchanged, but `zeroes` will hold whatever is returned by the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.**
