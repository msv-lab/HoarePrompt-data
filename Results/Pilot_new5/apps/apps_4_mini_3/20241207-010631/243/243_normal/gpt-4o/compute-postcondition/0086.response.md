Output State: **The program returns the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, which are the values that satisfy the conditions related to `func_1` and the search space defined by `low` and `high`. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If no match was found, `result` would be an empty list.**
