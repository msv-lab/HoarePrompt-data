According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left` and the result of `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute, it must hold that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 

Right before the loop, we have the following states:
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000)
- `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`
- `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `left` is equal to `mid`

For the loop to execute one time:
- We need `func_1(left)` to return `m`. Since we know `left` is equal to `mid`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`.
- This means that the function `func_1` must be designed such that it can return `m` when called with the current value of `left`.

Since we do not have specific information about the behavior of `func_1`, we must ensure that the state of `left` or the parameters affecting `func_1(left)` can lead to the condition being true. 

To guarantee that `func_1(left) == m`, we will specify that `func_1(left)` must evaluate to `m`, which is the target for the loop's condition.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`, and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`**
