According to the code, the `while` loop can continue executing as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Since we need the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` for the next iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `left` must be adjusted. If `left` is decreased by any amount (such as `left = mid - 2`), `func_1(left)` may no longer equal `m`. Therefore, we cannot decrease `left`. Since `left` is currently equal to `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` continues to equal `m`.

We also need to consider that `low` must remain less than or equal to `high`. We don't have any information indicating that `low` or `high` needs adjustment in this scenario since we are focusing on `left` and `func_1(left)`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`.**
