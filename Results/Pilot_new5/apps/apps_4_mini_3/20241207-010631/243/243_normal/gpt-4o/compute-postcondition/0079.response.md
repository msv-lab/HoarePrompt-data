The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The value of `right` was previously such that `func_1(right) == m`, so after the increment, `right` becomes the next integer greater than the previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + 1`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + 1**.
