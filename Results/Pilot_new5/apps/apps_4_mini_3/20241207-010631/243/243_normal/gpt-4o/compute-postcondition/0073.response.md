The code assigns a new value to the variable `right`, specifically `mid + 1`. The previous values indicate that `left` was adjusted such that `func_1(left + 1)` equals `m`, and that `func_1(left)` is less than `m`. However, the specific values of `mid` and `right` are not directly mentioned in the initial state, so we can only express `right` in terms of `mid`.

The value of `left` is not directly affected by the operation, and we maintain the existing conditions about its relationship with `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` while keeping the valid preconditions about `left`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` is equal to `mid + 1.**
