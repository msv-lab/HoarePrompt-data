Output State: **`right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + k` for some positive integer k where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, and `func_1(left)` is less than `m`. If `func_1(right)` was initially equal to `m`, it will now be greater than `m` after the loop has executed.**
