To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to continue executing, we need `func_1(left)` to still equal `m` in the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `left` has been decremented by 1, which means its current value is `left - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we require `func_1(left - 1) == m`. Given that `left` must be such that `func_1(left + 1)` equals `m`, we infer that `left` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the function remains equal to `m` after the decrement.

Thus, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` still equals `m` after the decrement. Specifically, we need `left` to be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m` without `left` being decremented too much.

State: **`left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`**
