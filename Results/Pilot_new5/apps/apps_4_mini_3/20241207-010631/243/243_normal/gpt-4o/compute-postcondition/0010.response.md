The code assigns the value of `mid - 1` to `high`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. Since `high` is initially equal to `5 * (m + 1)`, after the assignment, `high` will be updated to `mid - 1`, which is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `high` while keeping the other variable states unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and is greater than or equal to `m`; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
