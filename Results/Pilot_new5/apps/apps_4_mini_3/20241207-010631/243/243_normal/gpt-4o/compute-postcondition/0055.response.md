The variable `result` is assigned a list that contains a range of integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. The value of `left` is `mid - k`, and `right` is `mid + n`, where `n` is at least 1. Thus, `right` will be greater than `left + 1`, resulting in a non-empty list for `result`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `right` is equal to `mid + n`, `result` is a list containing values from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (inclusive).**
