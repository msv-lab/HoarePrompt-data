To calculate the value of `mid`, we first need to consider the variables `low`, `high`, and `m`. 

1. `low` is given as 0.
2. `high` is given as equal to `5 * (m + 1)`. So, we can express `high` as `5 * (m + 1)`.

The `mid` is calculated as:
```
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

Now substituting the current values:
- `low = 0`
- `high = 5 * (m + 1)`

Calculating `mid`:
```
mid = (0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2
mid = (5 * (m + 1)) // 2
```

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, including `result`, which stays as an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2**
