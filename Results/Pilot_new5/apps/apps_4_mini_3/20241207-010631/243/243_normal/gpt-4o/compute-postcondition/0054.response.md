Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + n` where `n` is the number of times the loop executed, which must be at least 1.**
