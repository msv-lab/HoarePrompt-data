The initial state specifies that `left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, and `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + the number of times the loop executed. 

The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`.

1. The range starts from `left + 1`.
2. The end of the range is `right`, which is the original value of `right` plus the number of times the loop executed.
3. The `result` variable will now hold a list of integers, which is a new value that was not previously defined.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + the number of times the loop executed, and `result` is now a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
