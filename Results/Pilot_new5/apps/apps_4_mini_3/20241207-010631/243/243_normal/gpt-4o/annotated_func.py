    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` is the last position where `func_1(left) < m` and `right` is the first position where `func_1(right) > m`. The values of `low` and `high` reflect the final bounds of the search space, with `mid` being the last computed midpoint resulting from the last iteration of the loop. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If the loop did not find a match, `result` would remain an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, which are the values that satisfy the conditions related to `func_1` and the search space defined by `low` and `high`. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If no match was found, `result` would be an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, as determined by the auxiliary function `func_1`. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list. The code effectively finds the range of integers yielding the specified number of trailing zeroes but relies on `func_1`, whose specific implementation and behavior are not provided, which could affect the results.
