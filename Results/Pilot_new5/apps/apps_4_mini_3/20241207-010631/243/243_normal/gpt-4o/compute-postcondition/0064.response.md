The code initializes `result` as an empty list. This does not change any of the previously defined variables but introduces a new variable `result` which now holds an empty list. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
