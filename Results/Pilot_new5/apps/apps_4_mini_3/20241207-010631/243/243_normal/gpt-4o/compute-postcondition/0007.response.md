The code assigns `low` the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `mid` will be a positive integer. The new value of `low` becomes `mid + 1`, which is also a positive integer. The values of `high`, `result`, `zeroes`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and is less than `m`.**
