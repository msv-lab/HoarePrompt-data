According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. Since the state already indicates that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, no adjustments are needed for the `right` variable. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, there are no modifications required to ensure the loop can execute once more. 

State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 3.**
