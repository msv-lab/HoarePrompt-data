Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` remains an empty list, and `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 with `zeroes` being the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 - 1 while `low` remains 0, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, and `result` remains an empty list. If `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `low` stays at 0, `high` equals 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, and `result` contains integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `right` being updated by the number of times the loop executed.***
