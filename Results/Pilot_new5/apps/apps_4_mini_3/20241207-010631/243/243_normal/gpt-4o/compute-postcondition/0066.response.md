According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and the return value of `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

Right before the loop, the state indicates that `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. However, this information does not indicate what `func_1(left)` returns. 

To ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, we do not have enough constraints on `left` or `func_1`. The only adjustment we can make to ensure the loop executes is to ensure that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Therefore, we need to state that `func_1(left)` must return `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2; func_1(left) must equal m**
