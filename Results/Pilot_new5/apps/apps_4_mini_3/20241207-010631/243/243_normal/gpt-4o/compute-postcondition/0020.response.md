To analyze the output state after the loop executes, we need to consider how the loop works and the conditions that must be true for it to execute multiple times.

### Initial State:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.
- `left` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop structure is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    left -= 1
```

This means that for the loop to execute:
1. `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`, allowing the loop to continue.
2. Each iteration decreases the value of `left` by 1.

### Output State after Loop Execution:
- After the loop has finished executing, it will stop when `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.
- The final value of `left` would be decreased until `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`.

1. **After 1 Execution**: It is guaranteed that `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` and `left` is now `left - 1`.
2. **After 2 Executions**: It is guaranteed that `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` during the first iteration and must have been equal to `m` again prior to decrementing `left` the second time.
3. **After 3 Executions**: Similar to above, `func_1(left)` must have returned `m` twice consecutively before `left` was decremented again.

Ultimately, the loop continues decrementing `left` until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

### Final Output State:
- If `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m` after the last successful iteration, we cannot determine the exact final value of `left` without a concrete example of how `func_1` behaves. However, we know:
  - The value of `left` will be `left_initial - k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed successfully.
  - `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed is:

Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.**
