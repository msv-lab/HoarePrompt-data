Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; if `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged, and `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. Otherwise, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` equals `m`, `right` satisfies `func_1(right) == m + k` for some positive integer `k`, `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, and `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, resulting in `result` being a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and the most internal loop is exited.***
