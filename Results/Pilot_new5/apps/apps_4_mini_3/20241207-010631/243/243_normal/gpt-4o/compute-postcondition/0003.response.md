According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1). Given that `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000), `high` will always be greater than or equal to 5 * 2, which is 10. Thus, `low` (0) is indeed less than or equal to `high`, so the loop can execute.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, as the current values satisfy the loop's condition.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list**
