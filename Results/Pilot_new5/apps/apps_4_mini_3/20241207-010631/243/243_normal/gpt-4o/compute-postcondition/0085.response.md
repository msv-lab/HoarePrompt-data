Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` is the last position where `func_1(left) < m` and `right` is the first position where `func_1(right) > m`. The values of `low` and `high` reflect the final bounds of the search space, with `mid` being the last computed midpoint resulting from the last iteration of the loop. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If the loop did not find a match, `result` would remain an empty list.**
