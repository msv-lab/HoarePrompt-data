To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its functionality against the problem description.

The problem requires finding all positive integers `n` for which the factorial `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined primarily by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`, since there are generally more factors of 2 than 5.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `m`.
2. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function computes the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` using the formula that counts the factors of 5. It is correctly implemented.
3. **Function `func_2(m)`**: This function aims to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes:
   - It performs a binary search to locate a midpoint `mid`.
   - If the number of trailing zeroes from `func_1(mid)` is less than `m`, it adjusts the lower bound; if greater, it adjusts the upper bound.
   - Upon finding an exact match, it expands left and right from `mid` to find all integers that also yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - The results are stored in a list and returned.

### Edge Cases
To validate the program, we must consider edge cases:
- For the maximum input, `m = 100,000`, the logic should correctly identify potential ranges of `n`.
- When `m` is such that no `n` can yield exactly `m` zeroes, the program should return `0` correctly.

### Test Cases
1. **Input `1`**: 
   - Expected output: `5\n5 6 7 8 9` (the program returns this correctly).
2. **Input `5`**: 
   - Expected output: `0` (the program returns this correctly).
3. **Input `0`**: 
   - This case is interesting since there are no positive integers `n` for which `n!` has exactly `0` trailing zeroes. The program does not handle `m = 0`, which should theoretically return `0`, but input constraints specify `m` starts from `1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where `m` is `0`, which is outside the given constraints of `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`. However, since the problem description specifies only positive integers starting from `1`, we focus on inputs in that range.

Since the program correctly handles the intended range of inputs and produces the expected results for the test cases provided based on the problem statement, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly computes the number of integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes for the valid input range.
