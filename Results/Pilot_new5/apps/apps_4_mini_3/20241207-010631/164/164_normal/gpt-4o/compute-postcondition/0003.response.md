The code assigns the value of `T_pos` to be the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `line`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `G_pos` remain unchanged, but `T_pos` will be updated based on the content of `line`. The value of `T_pos` will depend on the specific input string `line`, which is user-defined, and thus can vary.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`; `line` is a user-defined string input; `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`.**
