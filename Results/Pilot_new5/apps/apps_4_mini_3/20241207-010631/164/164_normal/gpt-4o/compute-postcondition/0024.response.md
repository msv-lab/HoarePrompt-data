Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `G_pos`. If the character at `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
