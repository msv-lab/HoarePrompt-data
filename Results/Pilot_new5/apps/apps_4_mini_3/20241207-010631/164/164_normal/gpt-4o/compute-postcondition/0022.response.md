According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with a step of `k`. For the loop to execute again, the current value of `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are: `n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos + k`. Since `pos` is `T_pos + k`, it is currently outside the range for the loop to run again.

To execute one more time, we need to adjust the `pos` to the next iteration starting from `G_pos`. Thus, the new value of `pos` should be equal to `G_pos` because it will be the next position that can be evaluated in the loop.

The conditions remain as they are, but we ensure that `pos` is reset to a value that allows the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `G_pos`.**
