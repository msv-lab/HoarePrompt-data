The given program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the inputs `n`, `k`, and `line`. It uses the `index` method to find the positions of 'G' and 'T', which is required as per the problem statement.

2. **Position Comparison**:
   - The program compares the positions of 'G' and 'T' and ensures that `G_pos` is always less than or equal to `T_pos`. This allows for a consistent direction of jump checks from the grasshopper to the insect.

3. **Jump Logic**: 
   - The `for` loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`. This correctly models the grasshopper's ability to jump to positions that are exactly `k` cells away, as specified in the problem.

4. **Obstacle Handling**:
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the current position (`pos`) is an obstacle ('#'). If it encounters an obstacle, it breaks out of the loop. This behavior respects the conditions given in the problem where the grasshopper cannot jump into an occupied cell.

5. **Reachability Check**:
   - After checking the range, if `pos` matches `T_pos`, it sets `reachable` to `True`. This satisfies the requirement to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect and 'NO' otherwise, which aligns with the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program accounts for all edge cases, such as:
- Obstacles directly between 'G' and 'T'.
- Different values of `k` that determine jump length.
- The general constraints around the input sizes and characters.

Since it accurately models the problem requirements and handles all cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
