In this case, `G_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of the character 'G' in the string `line`. The value of `n` is not directly affected, but `line` must contain the character 'G' for the index to be valid. 

Since the values of `n` and `k` are not directly involved in this operation, their constraints remain unchanged. However, we can specify that `G_pos` will hold a valid index based on the presence of 'G' in `line`. 

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`; `line` is a user-defined string input; `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`.**
