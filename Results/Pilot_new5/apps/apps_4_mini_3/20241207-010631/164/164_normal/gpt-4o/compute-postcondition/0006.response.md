Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` is updated to the previous value of `G_pos`, resulting in the current value of `G_pos` being less than the current value of `T_pos`.***
