The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`. Additionally, the function accepts a string of length `n` that consists of exactly one 'G' (representing the grasshopper's start position), one 'T' (representing the insect's position), empty cells represented by '.', and obstacles represented by '#'.

The output of the function is determined by the positions of 'G' and 'T' in the input string. The specific return values are not provided, but the function likely evaluates the ability of the grasshopper to reach the insect based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), `k` (an integer between 1 and n-1), and a string of length `n` that contains one 'G', one 'T', '.' for empty cells, and '#' for obstacles. It returns a result based on the grasshopper's ability to reach the insect.**
