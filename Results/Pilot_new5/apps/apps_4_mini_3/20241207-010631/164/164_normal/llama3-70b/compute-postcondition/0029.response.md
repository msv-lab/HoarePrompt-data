Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, which is not -1, and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, which is not -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` are not '#', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an integer `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` equals '#', then 'NO' is printed.***
