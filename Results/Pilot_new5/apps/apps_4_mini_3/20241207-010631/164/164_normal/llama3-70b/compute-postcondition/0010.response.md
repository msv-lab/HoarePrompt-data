Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is set to 0 and `t` remains -1. Otherwise, `g` remains -1, `t` is set to 0 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', and if it is not 'T', the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `g`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
