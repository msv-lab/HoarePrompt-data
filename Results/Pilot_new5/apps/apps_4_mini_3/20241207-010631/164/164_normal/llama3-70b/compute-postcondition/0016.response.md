To determine the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop, we must consider the range defined by `n` and the current value of `i`.

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which indicates it will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `n` in order for the loop to execute again.
3. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the beginning of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` accordingly.
4. The loop's condition specifies that `t` can only be updated if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'. 

Given that `n` is between 2 and 100, and `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, we know that:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- The next value of `i` must still be less than `n` to continue executing.

Assuming `i` is currently valid and within the range for the loop to execute again:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is either 0 or -1, `t` is updated to `n-1`, character at index `i` must be 'T', `i` is incremented to `i+1`.** 

Since we don't know the exact previous values of `i` and the character at that index in `s`, we need to generalize:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is either 0 or -1, `t` is updated to `n-1`, character at index `i` must be 'T', `i` is between 0 and `n-1`.**
