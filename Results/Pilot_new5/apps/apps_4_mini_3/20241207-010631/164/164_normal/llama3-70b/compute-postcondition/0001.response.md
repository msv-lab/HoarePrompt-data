The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes an input from the user. Other variables remain unaffected. The variable `k` is described as being an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), while `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The specific value for `s` is not known as it depends on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string.**
