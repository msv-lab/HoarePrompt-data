Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is either 0 or -1, `t` is updated to `n-1`, and character at index `i` must be 'T', `i` is between 0 and `n-1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to `i`; otherwise, `t` remains as `n - 1`.***
