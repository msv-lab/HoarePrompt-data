Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, which is not -1, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, which is not -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an integer `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` equals '#' for any `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`.***
