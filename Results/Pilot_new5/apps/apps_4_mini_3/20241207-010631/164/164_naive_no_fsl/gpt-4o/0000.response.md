Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

### Issue:
1. The code only checks the path from the grasshopper's initial position (G) to the target position (T) when G is to the left of T. However, it does not account for the situation where G is to the right of T. In that case, the program checks only to the right of G, which could lead to incorrect results, especially when G is positioned after T.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5 2
G#T..
```
In this case:
- `G` is at index 0
- `T` is at index 2
- The grasshopper can jump over the `#` at index 1 and reach T at index 2.

The program would produce "NO" because it would check for reachable positions and stop at the `#`. The correct answer should be "YES" because the grasshopper can jump over the obstacle.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases correctly when G is to the left and there are obstacles. 

Since the logic does not cover all cases correctly and fails for the example provided, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
