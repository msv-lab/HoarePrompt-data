The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Since `count_zeros` was initially 0, its new value becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, `digit` is '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, `digit` is '0'**.
