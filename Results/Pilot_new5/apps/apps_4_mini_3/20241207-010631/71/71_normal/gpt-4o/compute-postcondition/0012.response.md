Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `count_zeros` is updated to 1 if `digit` is '0' or remains 0 if `digit` is not '0', and `to_remove` is updated to 0 if `digit` is '0' or to 1 if `digit` is not '0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
