The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, however, the previous value of `count_zeros` is not specified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `count_zeros` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n` (from the end), `count_zeros` has been incremented by 1.**
