The variable `count_zeros` is initialized to 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0.**
