The value of `w` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `w` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n_original / 10`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, and `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is `n_original / 10`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `w` is increased by 1**
