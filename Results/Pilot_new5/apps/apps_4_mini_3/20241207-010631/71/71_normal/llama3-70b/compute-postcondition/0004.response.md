The value of `n` is modified by performing integer division by 10. Since `n` must not be a multiple of 10, the new value of `n` will be the original value of `n` divided by 10, discarding any remainder. The variable `w` is also mentioned to be increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, we can only denote that `w` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n` divided by 10; `w` is increased by 1**
