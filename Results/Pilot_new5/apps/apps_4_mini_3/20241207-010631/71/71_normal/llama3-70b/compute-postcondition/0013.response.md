The function `func` accepts parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 9. After executing the function body, the function will return a value based on the calculations or conditions applied to `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000) and a positive integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 9). It returns a value based on the processing of these parameters.**
