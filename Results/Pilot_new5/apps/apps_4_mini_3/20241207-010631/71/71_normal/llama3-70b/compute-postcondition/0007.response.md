The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division (`//`) of `n` by `10`. Given that `n` is initially `n_original / 10` and `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `n` will be reduced to `n_original / 10 // 10`, which simplifies to `n_original / 100`. The value of `w` has already been increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `w` is increased by 1**.
