The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `w` is unknown, we cannot specify its new value, but we know that it is now `w + 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still must not be a multiple of `10`. 

Output State: **`n` must not be a multiple of `10`; `w` is increased by 1**.
