#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), s is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i represents the volume of the i-th keg (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `high` is less than `min(v)`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12). If the loop executed, the original `low` was less than `min(v)`, and if the loop executed at least once, it indicates that the final value of `low` is the maximum value for which the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than `s`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is less than `min(v)`. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, then `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `low` is the maximum value for which the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than or equal to `s`, `high` is equal to `low`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, and `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total volume), along with a list `v` of integers representing the volume of each keg. It calculates the maximum volume `low` such that the sum of the minimum of `low` and each keg volume is equal to `s`. If no such volume exists, it prints `-1`. If it exists, it prints the calculated value of `low`. This function performs a binary search to find `low` and handles edge cases where `s` is not achievable with the given keg volumes.
