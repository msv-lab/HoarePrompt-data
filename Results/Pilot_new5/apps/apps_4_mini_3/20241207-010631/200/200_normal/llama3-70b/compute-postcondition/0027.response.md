Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, `high` is less than `min(v)`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`. If the loop executed, the final value of `low` is the maximum value for which the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than or equal to `s`.`***
