The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of kegs, and `s`, which is a positive integer representing the total volume required. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `v`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` represents the volume of the i-th keg. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to achieve exactly the total volume `s` using the volumes from the kegs in the list `v`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer for the number of kegs), s (a positive integer for the total volume), and v (a list of n integers representing keg volumes), and returns a boolean indicating if the total volume s can be achieved with the kegs.**
