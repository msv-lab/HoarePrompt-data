The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. The count of integers `n` remains unchanged, and `s` is still an input positive integer. The specific order of integers in `v` has changed to a sorted order, but the exact contents of `v` are not specified.

Output State: **`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `n` is the count of integers from input, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12)**
