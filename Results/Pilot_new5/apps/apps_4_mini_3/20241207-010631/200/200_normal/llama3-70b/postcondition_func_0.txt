The function accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total volume), along with a list `v` of integers representing the volume of each keg. It calculates the maximum volume `low` such that the sum of the minimum of `low` and each keg volume is equal to `s`. If no such volume exists, it prints `-1`. If it exists, it prints the calculated value of `low`. This function performs a binary search to find `low` and handles edge cases where `s` is not achievable with the given keg volumes.
