Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers greater than 0, `n` is the count of integers from input, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `low` is 0, `high` is `min(v)`, `mid` is `(0 + min(v) + 1) // 2`, and `total`, which is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`, is less than `s`.***
