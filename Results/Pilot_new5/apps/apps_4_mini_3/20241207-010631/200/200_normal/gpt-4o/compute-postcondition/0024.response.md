The `break` statement is used to exit the closest enclosing loop prematurely. In this case, it indicates that the execution will stop the loop at the point where this statement is encountered without making any changes to the values of the variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `i` is equal to `n` and we break out of the most internal loop.**
