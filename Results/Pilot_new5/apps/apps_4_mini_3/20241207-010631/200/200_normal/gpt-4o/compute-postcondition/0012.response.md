Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 1000], `s` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 10^12], `v` is a list of integers equal to the input values representing the volumes of the kegs, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`, and `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is 0, and `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume` (i.e., `volumes[i] > volumes[0])`.***
