Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is less than its previous value, indicating that not enough kvass was collected from the available kegs; `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed, which can be at most `n`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed.***
