The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. However, since there are no variables being modified or updated, and the `continue` statement does not directly affect the values of any variables, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `i` is equal to `n` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
