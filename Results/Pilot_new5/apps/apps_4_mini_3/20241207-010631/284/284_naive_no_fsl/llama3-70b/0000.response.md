Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it first attempts to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number through the `func_1` function, but it attempts to print `m` without a proper condition check for all possible values of `m`. 

The loop iterates through values of `m` starting from 1 up to 1000, but the function `func_1` is called after the loop's declaration which means that the input `n` is accepted before the check begins. However, the flow of checking and printing `m` does not guarantee that it will always find a non-prime value for `n * m + 1`. 

For example, if we take `n = 1`, the program would check:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime, but it doesn't print because it did not break out before the loop ends)

It does not guarantee finding a valid `m` for all inputs, especially for smaller values of `n`, and it may end up not printing anything if it continues to find only prime results.

Additionally, the logic of finding a non-prime number for every n is not well handled in this implementation, as it can skip non-prime outputs if it reaches a prime before finding a valid `m`.

Thus, the program does not ensure that it will output a valid counterexample for every integer `n` within the range specified, making it incorrect.
