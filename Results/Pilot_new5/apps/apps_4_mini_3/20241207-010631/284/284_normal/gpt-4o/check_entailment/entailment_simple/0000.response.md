To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and how the program operates.

### Problem Description Recap:

1. The program must find a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
2. The output must satisfy the condition that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
3. It is guaranteed that a suitable `m` exists for the given `n`.

### Program Analysis:

- The program begins by taking an integer input `n`.
- It iterates over values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
- For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if the result is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements a primality test to determine if a number `x` is prime:
  - It first checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1 (returns `False`).
  - It checks if `x` is 2 or 3 (returns `True`).
  - It checks for even numbers and multiples of 3 (returns `False`).
  - For larger numbers, it uses a loop to check divisibility by potential factors, returning `False` if any are found, and `True` if none are found.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The program correctly identifies when `n * m + 1` is not a prime number by using the `func_1`. When it finds such an `m`, it prints that value and stops further computation.
- Given that the problem guarantees the existence of an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, the program will always find and output a suitable `m` within the specified range.

### Conclusion:

The program adheres to the problem description requirements and effectively finds a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis. Thus, it is correct in its implementation.

Correctness: **True**
