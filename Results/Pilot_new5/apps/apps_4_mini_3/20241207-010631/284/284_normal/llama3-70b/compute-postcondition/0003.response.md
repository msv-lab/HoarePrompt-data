According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting point is 2, and the ending point is determined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `num` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 1 (as the square root of 2 is approximately 1.41, and the integer part is 1). Therefore, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be at least 2, which means the loop will execute if `num` is 2 or greater.

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will need to start at 2. Thus, the state adjustments required are:

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000 and num is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
