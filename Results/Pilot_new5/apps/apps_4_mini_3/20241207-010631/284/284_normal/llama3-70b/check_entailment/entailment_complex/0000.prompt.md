You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
def func_1(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because the current value of 'num' is less than 2, which is inconsistent with it being a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ 'num' ≤ 1000
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000, and num is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, and `num` is prime if the loop executes without returning, otherwise `num` is not prime if the loop returns False due to divisibility by an `i`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the positive integer 'num' is prime as no divisibility was found within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range 1 to 1000. It returns False if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for factors from 2 to the square root of `num`. If any factor divides `num` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If no factors are found, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. The function does not handle cases where `num` is less than 1 as specified in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
