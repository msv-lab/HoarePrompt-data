According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `num`. If `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. The upper limit for `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Since `num` is an odd positive integer such that 9 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, we need to find the integer part of the square root of `num`. For example, if `num` is at its maximum of 1000, `int(num ** 0.5)` would be 31, and if `num` is at its minimum of 9, it would be 3.

However, since `i` is currently 3 and the next value for `i` in the loop will be 4, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

State: **`num` is an odd positive integer such that 9 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 4**
