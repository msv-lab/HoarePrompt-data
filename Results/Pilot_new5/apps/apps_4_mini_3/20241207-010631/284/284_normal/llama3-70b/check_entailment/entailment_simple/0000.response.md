To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to scrutinize the logic of the program against the requirements outlined.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must find a positive integer `m` such that for a given integer `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.
2. The value of `m` should be in the range from 1 to 1000.
3. It is guaranteed that such an `m` exists for any given `n` in the range of 1 to 1000.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads an integer `n` from input.
- It then iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
- For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is prime using the `func_1` function.
- The `func_1` function determines if a number is prime:
  - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct since primes are defined as natural numbers greater than 1.
  - For numbers 2 or greater, it checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 to the square root of the number. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

### Evaluating Correctness:
1. The program will correctly find a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime because:
   - The iteration goes from 1 to 1000, ensuring it checks all valid `m` values.
   - The function `func_1` accurately determines primality.

2. Given that the problem guarantees the existence of such an `m`, the program will eventually break out of the loop once it finds a non-prime result and print the value of `m`.

3. Since the program checks each possible `m` and stops at the first non-prime outcome, it adheres strictly to the requirement of finding at least one valid `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all requirements stated in the problem description. It effectively finds and outputs a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime.

Correctness: **True**
