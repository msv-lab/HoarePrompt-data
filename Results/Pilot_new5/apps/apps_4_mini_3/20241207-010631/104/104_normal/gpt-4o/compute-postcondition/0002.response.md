The variable `max_erase` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `max_erase` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `max_erase` is 0.**
