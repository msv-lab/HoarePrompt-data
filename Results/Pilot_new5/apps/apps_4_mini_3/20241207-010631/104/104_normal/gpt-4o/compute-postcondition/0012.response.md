Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a list `a` containing `n` strictly increasing integers (where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000). It calculates the maximum gap between consecutive integers in `a` minus one and prints this value. If `n` is 1, the function will output 0 since there are no gaps to compute. **
