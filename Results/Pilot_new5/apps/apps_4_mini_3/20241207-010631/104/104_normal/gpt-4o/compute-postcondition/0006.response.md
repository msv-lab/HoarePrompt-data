To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the provided code in the context of the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] \leq 1000\)
- `max_erase` is \(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)\)

The code:
```
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `max_erase` is updated by taking the maximum of the current `max_erase` value and \(a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1\).
2. Here, `i` is 2, so we will access elements in the list `a` at indices 2 and 1.
3. The expression \(a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1\) evaluates to \(a[2] - a[1] - 1\).
4. Since `max_erase` was previously defined as \(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)\), its potential value will depend on the values in the list `a`.

Output State:
- We retain all information about `n`, `i`, and `a` since they remain unchanged.
- We update `max_erase` to be the maximum of its previous value and \(a[2] - a[1] - 1\).

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is max(max_erase, a[2] - a[1] - 1)**.
