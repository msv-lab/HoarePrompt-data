Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 0. If the condition that all elements from `a[i]` to `a[j]` are sequentially increasing (i.e., each element differs by exactly one from its predecessor) holds true, the state remains unchanged.***
