The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of the previous value of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, we can calculate `j - i - 1`:

`j - i - 1` = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1.

The new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum of its previous value and 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is max(previous `max_erase`, 1)**.
