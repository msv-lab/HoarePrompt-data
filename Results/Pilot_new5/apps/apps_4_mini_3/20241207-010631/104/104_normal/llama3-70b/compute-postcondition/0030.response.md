The expression `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` calculates the maximum value between the current value of `max_erase` and the expression `j - i - 1`. The variables `i` and `j` have specific values: `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `j - i - 1` equates to `3 - 2 - 1`, which results in `0`. 

The value of `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `0`. However, since the initial value of `max_erase` remains unchanged in this specific example, we cannot deduce its value from the provided information.

Thus, the output state reflects the current values of the variables, with `max_erase` potentially updated if it was less than `0`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `max_erase` is max(previous `max_erase`, 0)**.
