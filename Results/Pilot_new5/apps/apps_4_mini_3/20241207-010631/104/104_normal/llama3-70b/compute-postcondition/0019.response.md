Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 0, `j` is 2, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true, then `max_erase` remains unchanged or is updated accordingly.***
