To analyze the impact of the given code, we observe the following:

- The variable `max_erase` is updated based on the formula `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`.
- The value of `j` is 3 and the value of `i` is 1, so the expression `j - i - 1` evaluates to `3 - 1 - 1`, which results in `1`.
- The previous value of `max_erase` can be either updated or remain unchanged based on its comparison with `1`.

Since `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `1`, the new value of `max_erase` will be either its current value or `1`, whichever is greater. 

Now let's summarize the output state:

- The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution.
- The specific outcome for `max_erase` is that it will either retain its original value if it is greater than or equal to `1` or be set to `1` if it is less than `1`.

Given the potential conditions of `max_erase`, we can summarize the output state accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1.**
