According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the starting value for `j` will be `2 + 1 = 3`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because the upper limit of the range is `n + 1`. If `n` is 3, the range would be `range(3, 4)`, which contains only the value 3 for `j`. If `n` is greater than 3, the loop will have more iterations. 

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, it can be any integer from 3 to 100. 

At the start of the loop:
- `j` will start at 3.
- The condition `1 <= n <= 100` and `n > 2` is already satisfied.

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `j` must be initialized at 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `max_erase` remains unchanged**.
