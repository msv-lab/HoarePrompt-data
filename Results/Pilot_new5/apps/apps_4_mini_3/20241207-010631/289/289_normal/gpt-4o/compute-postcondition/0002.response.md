The code snippet prints the value of `max_games`, but does not modify any variables or affect their values. The initial state of the variables remains valid, and since no specific value is assigned to `max_games`, it retains its integer status within the defined range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^18; `max_games` is an integer such that 1 <= `max_games` <= 59 and the value of `max_games` has been printed.**
