The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is constrained such that `n` is an integer with a range of 2 to 10^18. The output produced by the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function without knowing what it returns based on the value of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters; it operates under the constraint that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18, but its return value is undefined in the provided information.**
