The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is implied that `n`, which is an integer and represents the number of players participating in the tournament, is already defined within the function's context or through some external means. The functionality of the function is not explicitly described in the provided output, so we cannot determine what it returns. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only conclude the constraints regarding `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates with an integer n representing the number of players in the tournament, constrained such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
