The function accepts no parameters but reads an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the number of players. It computes and prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` by calculating the bit length of `n` and subtracting one, effectively outputting the exponent of the largest power of 2 that fits within `n`. However, it does not return any value.
