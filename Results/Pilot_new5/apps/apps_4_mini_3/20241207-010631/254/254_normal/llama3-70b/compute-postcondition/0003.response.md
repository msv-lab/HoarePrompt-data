The operation involves swapping the values of `a` and `b` and calculating `a % b`. The variable `b` must be greater than 0, ensuring no division by zero occurs during the modulus operation. After the execution, `a` takes the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the result of `a % b`. 

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- Let `a` be some integer `x`
- Let `b` be some integer `y` where `y > 0`
- Let `c` be some integer `z`

After executing the code `a, b = b, a % b`, we have:
- `a` becomes `y` (the previous value of `b`)
- `b` becomes `x % y`

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `a` and `b`, while `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b` (previously `y`), `b` is equal to `a % b` (previously `x % y`), `c` is an integer.**
