According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is an integer representing a time interval, and since it is stated that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500, `b` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed as long as `b` is already greater than 0. 

State: **a is an integer, b must be greater than 0, c is an integer**
