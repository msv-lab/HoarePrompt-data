The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing time intervals of garlands, and they satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of these values when `b` is equal to 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b when b is 0.**
