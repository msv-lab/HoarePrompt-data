The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the expression `a, b = b, a % b`. Since `a` is equal to `b` (which is `y`), the first assignment makes `a` take the value of `b`, and the second assignment calculates `b` as `a % b`. Given that `b` must be non-zero, this ensures `b` will be updated to a valid integer. 

Since `a` is initially equal to `b`, `a % b` will always result in `0`, because any number modulo itself is zero. Therefore, after the execution, `a` will hold the previous value of `b` and `b` will become `0`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b` (previously `y`), `b` is 0, `c` is an integer**.
