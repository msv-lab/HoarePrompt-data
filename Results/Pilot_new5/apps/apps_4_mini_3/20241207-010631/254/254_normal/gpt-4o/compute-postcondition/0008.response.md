The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers ranging from 1 to 1500. However, specific output conditions based on these parameters have not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully articulated without knowing the return values or conditions related to `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
