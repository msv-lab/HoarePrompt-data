The function accepts three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` from the user input, each within the range of 1 to 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three integers and prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1 (indicating that the numbers are coprime), and 'NO' if the GCD is greater than 1. The function does not return any value.
