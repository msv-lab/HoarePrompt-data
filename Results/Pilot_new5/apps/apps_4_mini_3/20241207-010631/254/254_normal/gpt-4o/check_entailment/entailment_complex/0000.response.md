Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements set out in the problem description. 

The problem asks for a way to ensure that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum of the three chosen start times, \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). This means that the lit seconds of the garlands must cover all integers from that maximum onward.

The program attempts to determine this by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \). However, simply checking if the GCD is 1 (indicating that the three integers are coprime) does not guarantee that every integer second after the maximum \( x_i \) will be covered. 

For instance, consider the input \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
- The GCD of these values is 1, which means they are coprime according to the program's logic. However, if we switch on the garlands at any combination of times, there will always be seconds when no garland is lit. Specifically, for \( k_1 = 4 \) and \( k_2 = 2 \), every second will not be covered because the second garland lights up every second, but the first garland will not light on seconds 1, 2, or 3. 

Thus, the logic of simply checking the GCD does not cover the requirement of ensuring that every second is lit. The program fails to consider the specific intervals of the garlands adequately and, therefore, does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
