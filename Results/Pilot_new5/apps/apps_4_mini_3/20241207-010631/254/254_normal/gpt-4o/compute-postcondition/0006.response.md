The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply displays a message. The conditions regarding `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k_3`; and `gcd_all` is greater than 1. The value 'NO' has been printed.**
