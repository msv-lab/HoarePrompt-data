To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code:

1. The program computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.
2. It then checks whether this LCM is divisible by each of the intervals. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the chosen times. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a crucial flaw in the logic of this program related to the conditions for determining if it is possible to keep at least one garland lit at every second.

### Issues Identified:
- The program relies solely on the LCM being divisible by each of the intervals. This is not sufficient to ensure that there will always be a lit garland during each second after the maximum switch-on time. 
- The intervals `k1`, `k2`, `k3` can be such that there are gaps in the lit times that cannot be covered by any choice of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. For example, if `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, then even though the LCM might be divisible by all of them, there will still be seconds where no garland is lit.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`. The program would compute the LCM and find that it is divisible by all three intervals, leading it to incorrectly output "YES". However, if we choose any `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` that are based on this calculation, there will indeed be seconds when no garland is lit.

### Conclusion:
Since the program can produce incorrect outputs based on the flawed assumption that divisibility by LCM guarantees coverage for each second, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
