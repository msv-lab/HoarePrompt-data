Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if there exists a way to choose moments to turn on the garlands such that every second after the maximum of the chosen moments at least one garland is lit. However, the logic implemented in the program is flawed.

The use of the least common multiple (LCM) in the condition `lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` does not correctly capture the requirement from the problem description. Specifically, the problem does not require that the LCM of the intervals be divisible by all three intervals for there to always be at least one garland lit. It is possible for the garlands to be lit at different times such that their combined coverage still ensures that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the chosen moments.

An example where the code would fail is when the input is `1 1 2`. The program would calculate the LCM as `2`, which meets the criteria (as `2 % 1 == 0` and `2 % 2 == 0`). However, it is indeed possible to turn on the garlands at `x_1 = 1`, `x_2 = 1`, and `x_3 = 1`, resulting in coverage at every second after second 1 as follows:
- Garland 1: lit at seconds `1, 3, 5, ...`
- Garland 2: lit at seconds `1, 3, 5, ...`
- Garland 3: lit at seconds `2, 4, 6, ...`

Thus, there is indeed a point after the maximum time where at least one garland is lit, but the program would output "YES" incorrectly for certain combinations.

In conclusion, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem and misses cases where there should be valid configurations that the existing checks do not cover. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
