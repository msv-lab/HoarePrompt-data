The variable `x` is assigned a new value that is a list of integers, which are obtained by taking an input of space-separated integers and converting them into a list of integers using the `map` and `list` functions. The value of `n` and `y` remain unchanged, but the content of `x` now directly depends on the user's input.

The initial state indicates that `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, but after the execution of the code, `x` is specifically defined as the list obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers taken from input; `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000).**
