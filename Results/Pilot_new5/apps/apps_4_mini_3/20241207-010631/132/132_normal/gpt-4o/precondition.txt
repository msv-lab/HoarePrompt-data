n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), x is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile during the first visit (0 <= x[i] <= 1000 for each i), and y is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile during the second visit (0 <= y[i] <= 1000 for each i). The lengths of x and y are both equal to n.
