The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'Yes'. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`; the sum of the integers in `y` (total_y) is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in `x` (total_x), and the output 'Yes' is produced.

Output State: **`y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`; the sum of the integers in `y` (total_y) is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in `x` (total_x); 'Yes' has been printed.**
