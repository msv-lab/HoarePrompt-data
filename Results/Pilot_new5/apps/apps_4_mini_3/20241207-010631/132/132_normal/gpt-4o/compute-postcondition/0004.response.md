The variable `total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `y`. The length of `y` is `n`, and since each integer in `y` is between 0 and 1000, `total_y` will be a non-negative integer representing the sum of those integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`.

Output State: **`y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`.**
