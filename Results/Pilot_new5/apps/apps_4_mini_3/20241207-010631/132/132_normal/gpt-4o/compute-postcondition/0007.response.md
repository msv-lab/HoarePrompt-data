Postcondition: ***`y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`. The sum of the integers in `y` (total_y) is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in `x` (total_x).***
