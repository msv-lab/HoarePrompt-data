The value of `x` is reassigned to `x % 360`. The value of `x` is an integer within the range of -10^18 to 10^18. The modulo operation will yield a value between 0 and 359, inclusive, because any integer can be represented within the range of 0 to 359 when taking modulo 360. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `x` is now in the range [0, 359].**
