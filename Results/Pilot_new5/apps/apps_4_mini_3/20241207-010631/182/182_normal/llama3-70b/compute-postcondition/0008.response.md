Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `x`, representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. It normalizes `x` to the range [0, 359] by taking `x % 360`. If the normalized angle is 0, it prints 0. If the angle is not 0, it calculates and prints the quadrant of the angle based on its value, returning 1 for angles between 1-89, 2 for angles between 90-179, 3 for angles between 180-269, and 0 for angles between 270-359. Edge cases include large negative and positive values of `x`, which are effectively wrapped to the corresponding angle within the 0-359 range.**
