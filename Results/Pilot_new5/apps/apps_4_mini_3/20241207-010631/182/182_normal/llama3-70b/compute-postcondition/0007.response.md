The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates with a variable `x` that is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where `x` falls within the range of -10^18 to 10^18. Positive values of `x` indicate clockwise rotation, and negative values indicate counter-clockwise rotation. Based on the value of `x`, the function will perform an operation related to the camera's orientation or rotation. However, the specific return value is not provided in the description. 

Functionality: **The function uses an integer x representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, indicating rotation direction (clockwise for positive values and counter-clockwise for negative values).**
