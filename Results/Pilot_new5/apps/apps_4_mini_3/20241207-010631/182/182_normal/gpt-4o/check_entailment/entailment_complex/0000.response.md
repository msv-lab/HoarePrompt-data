The provided Python program attempts to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to correct the rotation of an image taken by a camera, based on the problem description. However, upon analysis, it does not fulfill all the requirements set out in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Normalization**: The program normalizes the input angle `x` using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This is appropriate as it brings the angle within the range of 0 to 359 degrees.

2. **Calculating Turns**: The line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` aims to calculate the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. However, this calculation does not correctly account for the problem statement's requirement to minimize deviation from vertical.

3. **Deviations from Vertical**: The core requirement is to determine the minimum deviation from vertical after the necessary rotations. The program simply computes turns without evaluating the resultant angle's deviation from vertical (the absolute difference from 0 degrees, or 360 degrees).

4. **Handling Negative Angles**: The normalization process does handle negative angles, but the calculation `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` does not yield the correct result for all cases, specifically when negative angles lead to a situation needing multiple turns to minimize the deviation.

5. **Examples**: 
   - The first example with an input of `60` should yield `1` 90-degree clockwise turn, which the program calculates correctly.
   - The second example with an input of `-60` should yield `3` turns, and while the program might produce this output, it does so without proper calculation of deviations from vertical, relying instead on a derived formula that might not account for all cases.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to minimize the angle deviation from vertical but rather computes the number of turns based on a flawed formula. The core aspect of evaluating which turns yield the minimal deviation is missing.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
