The value of `turns` is calculated using the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. The variable `normalized_angle` is already defined as `x % 360`, which means it will yield a value in the range [0, 359]. Therefore, the expression for `turns` can be simplified based on `normalized_angle`.

Given that `normalized_angle` will always be between 0 and 359, we can analyze the calculation of `turns`:

1. `360 - normalized_angle` will yield a value in the range [1, 360].
2. Dividing that by 90 with integer division `//` will yield one of the possible results: 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `normalized_angle`.
3. Finally, applying `% 4` does not affect the result since the integer division would already limit it to the range of 0 to 3.

Therefore, `turns` will be calculated as:

- `turns = (360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4`

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360` in the range [0, 359]; `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.**
