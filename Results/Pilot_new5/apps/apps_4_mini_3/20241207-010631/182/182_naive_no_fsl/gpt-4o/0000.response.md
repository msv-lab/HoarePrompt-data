To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential input cases.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The program must take an angle as input (which can be negative or positive).
2. It must calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize deviation from vertical.
3. The output should be a single integer representing those turns.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code reads an integer `x`, computes the normalized angle by performing `x % 360`, and calculates how many 90-degree clockwise turns are required using the formula:
```python
turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
```

### Key Scenarios to Consider:
1. **Positive Angles:** 
   - For an input of `60`, the normalized angle is `60`. The calculation would give:
     - `turns = (360 - 60) // 90 % 4` which results in `3` turns. This is correct as per the examples provided.

2. **Negative Angles:**
   - For an input of `-60`, the normalized angle would be `300`:
     - `turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4` gives `0` turns. This is incorrect according to the example provided, where it should output `3` turns.

3. **Full Rotations:**
   - For `360`, the normalized angle would be `0` leading to `0` turns as well, which is correct.
   - For `-360`, the normalized angle would also be `0` leading to `0` turns, which is again correct.
   
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For an input of `450` (which is 90 degrees clockwise), the normalized angle would be `90`. This would lead to `3` turns, which is correct.
   - For `-450`, the normalized angle would be `270`, leading to `1` turn, which aligns with the expected behavior.
   - For `720`, the normalized angle would be `0`, leading to `0` turns, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle negative angles correctly when they are not exactly multiples of 90 degrees. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates how many 90-degree turns are needed when facing angles between `-90` and `0`. 

Given that the program does not satisfy all the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly the negative angle cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The specific failing case is when the input is `-60`, where the expected output is `3` but the program outputs `0`.
