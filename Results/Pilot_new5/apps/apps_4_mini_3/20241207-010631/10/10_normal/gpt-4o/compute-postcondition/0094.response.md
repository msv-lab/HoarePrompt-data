The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the program state directly. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the increment operations that have already taken place prior to the `continue` statement.

Given the initial state, the following changes have already been made:
- `bottom_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.
- `top_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.
- `right_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.
- `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.
- `j` has been incremented by 2.
- `d` remains greater than `j + 2`.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` have been assigned values from `sofas[j]` based on the condition that `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.

No new changes occur as a result of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 2`, `d` is greater than `j + 2`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[j]` if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.**
