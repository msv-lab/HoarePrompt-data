The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change any variable values, but it affects the flow of control within a loop. Therefore, the output state will retain all existing values of the variables while indicating that the current iteration is being skipped.

Output State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `d` must be greater than `j + 1` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
