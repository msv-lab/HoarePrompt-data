Postcondition: ***`y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, and `y2_j` are the respective values of `y1` and `y2` before the execution of the if statement. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` are both incremented by 1, and `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The variables `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their respective values from `sofas[0]` throughout the process.***
