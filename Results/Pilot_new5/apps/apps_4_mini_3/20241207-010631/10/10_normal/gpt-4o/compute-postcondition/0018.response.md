According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. Since `d` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute at least once, `d` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `d - 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `d` should be greater than 0, and before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
