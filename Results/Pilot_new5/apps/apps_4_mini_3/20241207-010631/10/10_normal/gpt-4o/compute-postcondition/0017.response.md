The variable `bottom_count` is assigned a new list containing `d` integers, all initialized to 0. The initial state of `d` was a non-negative integer, which determines the length of the list `bottom_count`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of the form (x1, y1, x2, y2), `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0, `right_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0, `top_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0.**
