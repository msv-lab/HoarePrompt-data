Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. If both `y1` and `y2` are less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `right_count[0]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
