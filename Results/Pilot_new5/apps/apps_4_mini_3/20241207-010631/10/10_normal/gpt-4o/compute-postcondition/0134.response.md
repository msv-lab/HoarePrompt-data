Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`. Otherwise, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; `i` and `j` are unchanged; `d` is still greater than `j + 1`; and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged, provided that `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. If `x1` is less than or equal to `x2_j` or `x2` is less than or equal to `x2_j`, the counts remain unchanged.***
