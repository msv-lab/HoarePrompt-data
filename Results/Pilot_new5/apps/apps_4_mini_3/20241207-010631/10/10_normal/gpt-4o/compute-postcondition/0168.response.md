Functionality: ** The function reads the number of sofas and the dimensions of a storehouse, then collects the coordinates of each sofa into a list. It counts how many sofas are located to the left, right, above, and below each sofa. Finally, it searches for the first sofa that matches specific criteria regarding the counts of neighboring sofas and prints its 1-based index. If no such sofa is found, it prints -1. The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on user input for its execution. **
