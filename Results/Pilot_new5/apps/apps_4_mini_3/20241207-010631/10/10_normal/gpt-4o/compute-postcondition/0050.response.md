The `continue` statement is encountered, which causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and control to move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `j` is updated to `j + 1`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` also maintain the values from `sofas[0]`. 

Since there are no changes to the values of the variables except for `j`, the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`y1` is `y1`, `y2` is `y2`, `y1_j` is `y1_j`, `y2_j` is `y2_j`, `d` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `x1`, `y1` is `y1`, `x2` is `x2`, `y2` is `y2`, and the loop continues.**
