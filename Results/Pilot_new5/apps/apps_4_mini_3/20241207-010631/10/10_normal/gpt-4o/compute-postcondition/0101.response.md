Output State: **If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]`, and `right_count[i]` are each incremented by 1, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 2, `d` is greater than `j + 2`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[j]` where `i` is equal to `j`, with the conditions that `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.**
