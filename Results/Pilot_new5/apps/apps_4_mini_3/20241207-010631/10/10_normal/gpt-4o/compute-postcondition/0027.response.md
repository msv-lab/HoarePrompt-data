Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, and `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`. If the condition is not met, the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `right_count[0]` remain unchanged.***
