The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is equal to `d`, the value of `target_sofa` becomes `d + 1`. The other variables `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, `target_sofa` is `d + 1`, `i` is `d`.

Output State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, `target_sofa` is `d + 1`, `i` is `d`**
