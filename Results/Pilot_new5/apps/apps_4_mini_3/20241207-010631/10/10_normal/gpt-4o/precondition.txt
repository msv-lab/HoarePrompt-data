d is a positive integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), each of the next d lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m), and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) with constraints (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).
