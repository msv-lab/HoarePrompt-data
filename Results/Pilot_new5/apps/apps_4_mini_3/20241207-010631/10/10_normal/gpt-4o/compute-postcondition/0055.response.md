The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j`, `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `x2_j`, and `right_count[i]` remain unchanged from their previous values, and `j` was already incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j` maintain their respective values; `d` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`; if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1; `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j` maintain their respective values; `d` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`; if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1; `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
