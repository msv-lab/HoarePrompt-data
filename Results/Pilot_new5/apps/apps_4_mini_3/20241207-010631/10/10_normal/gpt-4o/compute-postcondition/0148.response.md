Postcondition: ***If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `i`, `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. If `y1` is not less than `y1_j` or `y2` is not less than `y1_j`, then all counts and other variables remain in their original state.***
