Postcondition: ***If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, and if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` are both incremented by 1. The variables `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their respective values from `sofas[0]`.***
