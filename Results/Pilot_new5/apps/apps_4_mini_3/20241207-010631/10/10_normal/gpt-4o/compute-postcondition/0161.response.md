According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `d-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `d`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `d`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `d`, and `d` must remain unchanged. 

State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, `target_sofa` is set to `d + 1`, `i` is `d`**
