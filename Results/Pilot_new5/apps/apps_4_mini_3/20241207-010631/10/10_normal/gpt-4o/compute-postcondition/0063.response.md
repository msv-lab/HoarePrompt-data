The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are now assigned the values from `sofas[i]`. The value of `i` is equal to `d`, which is greater than 0. Therefore, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will take on the values from the `sofas` array at index `d`. The other variables, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `d`, `j` is equal to `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[d]`, and `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged.**
