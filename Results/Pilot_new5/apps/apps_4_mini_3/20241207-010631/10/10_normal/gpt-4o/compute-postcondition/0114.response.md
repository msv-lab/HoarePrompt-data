The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The other variables `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged. The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[j]`, and it is ensured that `x1` and `x2` are both less than `x1_j`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `right_count[i]` has been increased by 1 while the other counts remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; `x1`, `x2` are both less than `x1_j`.**
