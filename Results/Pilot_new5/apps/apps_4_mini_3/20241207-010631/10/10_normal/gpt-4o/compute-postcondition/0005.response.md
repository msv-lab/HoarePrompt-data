The code appends a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the list `sofas`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The only change is the addition of a new tuple to the `sofas` list.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is now a list containing the tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers.**
