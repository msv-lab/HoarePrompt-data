The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
