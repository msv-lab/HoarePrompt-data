The variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user. The `map(int, input().strip().split())` function will read a line of input, split it into separate strings, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, convert those strings to integers, and then unpack them into the four variables.

Since `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are not defined in the initial state, they will be assigned new values which are input integers. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of the form (x1, y1, x2, y2), where each tuple corresponds to the input integers provided during each iteration of the loop; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers.**
