Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged. If both `x1` and `x2` are greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, while `right_count[i]` remains unchanged. If both `x1` and `x2` are less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.***
