The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and counts remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; `i` and `j` are unchanged; `d` must still be greater than `j + 1`; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.**
