The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count[i]` is equal to the count of sofas to the right of `sofas[i]`, `left_count[i]` is equal to the count of sofas to the left of `sofas[i]`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to the count of sofas below `sofas[i]`, `top_count[i]` is equal to the count of sofas above `sofas[i]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `sofas` is a list of at least `d` sofas, `d` is greater than 0, `target_sofa` is set to 1, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
