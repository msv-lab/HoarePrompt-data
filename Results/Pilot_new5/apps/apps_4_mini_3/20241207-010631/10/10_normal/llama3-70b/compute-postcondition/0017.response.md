The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial states of the variables `sofa`, `sofas`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least two tuples, `s` is the next tuple in the list, and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least two tuples, `s` is the next tuple in the list, and `left` is increased by 1.**
