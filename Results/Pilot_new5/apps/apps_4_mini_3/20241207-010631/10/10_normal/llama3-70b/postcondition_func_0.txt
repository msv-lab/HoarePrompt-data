The function accepts an integer `sofa` representing a specific sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` where each tuple contains coordinates and additional counts. It calculates and returns counts of how many sofas are positioned to the left, right, above, and below the specified `sofa`. If there are no other sofas to compare against, the function returns (0, 0, 0, 0) indicating no counts. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to the input values beyond the specified ranges.
