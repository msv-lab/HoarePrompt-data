The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The values of `sofa`, `sofas`, `s`, and `left` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, `s` is the tuple at index `i + 1`, and `right` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, `s` is the tuple at index `i + 1`, `right` is increased by 1**.
