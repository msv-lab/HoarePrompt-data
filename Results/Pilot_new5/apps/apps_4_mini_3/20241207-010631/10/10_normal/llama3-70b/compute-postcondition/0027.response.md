The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `left`, so we cannot specify its exact value or the resulting value after the increment. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, `s` is the tuple at index i + 1 and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, `s` is the tuple at index i + 1, and `left` is increased by 1.**
