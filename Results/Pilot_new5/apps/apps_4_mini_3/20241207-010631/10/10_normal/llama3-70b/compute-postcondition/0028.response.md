Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, `s` is the tuple at index i + 1. If the first element of `sofa[0]` is less than the first element of `s[0]` and the second element of `sofa[0]` is equal to the second element of `s[0]`, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.***
