Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), and `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is set to 1, `top` is set to 1, `bottom` remains 0, and `right` is set to 1. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged with `right` still equal to 0.***
