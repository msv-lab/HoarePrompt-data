`right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is 0, so the new value is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least 1 tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is now 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`, the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`. 

Output State: **`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least 1 tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is now 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`, the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`.**
