The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. The parameter `sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas, constrained to the range (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000). The parameter `sofas` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers that represent the coordinates of each sofa (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m), followed by another tuple containing four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b), which represent the counts for left, right, top, and bottom, respectively, constrained such that (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ sofa - 1). The function returns the counts of sofas: left, right, top, and bottom, which will all be 0 if the loop does not execute.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `sofa` and a list of tuples `sofas`, returning the counts of sofas: left, right, top, and bottom, which are all 0 if the loop does not execute.**
