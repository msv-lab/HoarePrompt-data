Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `left` is 1, `top` remains 0, and `bottom` remains 0. The current value of `right` is 1, as the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is less than the first element of the first tuple in `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`.***
