Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ `sofa` ≤ 100000) and `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` while `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged.***
