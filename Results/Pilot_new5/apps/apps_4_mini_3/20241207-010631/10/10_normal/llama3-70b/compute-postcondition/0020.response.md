Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least two tuples, and `s` is the next tuple in the list. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` is equal to `s[0][1]`, then `right` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `right` remains unchanged.***
