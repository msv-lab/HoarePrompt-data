According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sofas` list. The loop will execute if `sofas` contains at least one tuple, as it iterates over each element in the list. The current values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `sofas` is not empty.

State: **`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
