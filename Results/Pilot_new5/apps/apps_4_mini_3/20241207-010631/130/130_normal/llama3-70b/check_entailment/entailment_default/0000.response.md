The given problem requires determining the minimum number of coins that each of Ivan's friends can gift him while satisfying certain conditions regarding the total number and uniqueness of the coins. 

Looking at the code:

```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `N`: Total number of different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of friends.
   - `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

2. **Conditions Checked**:
   - The code checks if `M` (the number of friends) is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` (the required number of unique coins that need to be gifted to ensure they are new).
   - It also checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `L` (the minimum number of new coins required).

### Edge Cases and Logic
- If `M` is less than `N - K + 1`, then it's impossible for the friends to give Ivan enough unique coins because there are not enough different coins available.
- If `M` is less than `L`, then it's impossible to meet the requirement of new coins because there aren't enough friends to give at least `L` new coins.

### Potential Missing Logic
The code assumes that if both conditions are met, then gifting 1 coin per friend is sufficient. However, there are cases when `M` might be equal to `N - K + 1` or `M` might be equal to `L`, which could require more than one coin per friend. 

Example:
- If `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, `L = 3`, the code would correctly output `1` since all friends can give one different coin, ensuring the minimum of 13 new coins out of 15. 
- However, if `M = 10`, `N = 10`, `K = 9`, and `L = 1`, the code incorrectly determines that 1 coin per friend is acceptable when in fact, they cannot fulfill the requirement of gifting at least 1 new coin (as Ivan already has almost all coins).

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints state that the function checks certain conditions and outputs either `1` or `-1`. However, it does not consider that multiple coins might need to be gifted per friend, based on the friendship count and the total collectibles available.

### Conclusion
The code does not take all edge cases into account, as it simplistically checks the two conditions without considering how the coins must be distributed amongst friends.

Correctness: **False**. 

The logic fails in cases where `M` is limited but the conditions `N - K + 1` and `L` create a need for more than one coin per friend. Thus, the program is not correct for all cases defined in the problem description.
