The code snippet `print(-1)` simply outputs the value `-1`. It does not affect the values of any of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, or `L`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding those variables.

Output State: **`N` is the first input integer, `M` is the second input integer, `K` is the third input integer, `L` is the fourth input integer, where 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, and 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18. It is not true that `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`. Therefore, either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`. Value printed: -1**
