The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` but does not change any of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`, or `min_x`. The precondition stating that `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K` remains valid since no variables are altered. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`; the value of `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`; -1 has been printed.**
