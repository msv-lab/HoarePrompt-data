To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be different.
3. At least \( L \) coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

**Input Variables:**
- \( N \): total different collectible coins available.
- \( M \): number of friends.
- \( K \): number of coins Ivan already has.
- \( L \): minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

### Output Requirements:
- Output the minimum number of coins each friend must gift or -1 if it's not possible to satisfy the conditions.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Minimum Coins Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend must gift using the formula:
     \[
     \text{min\_x} = \frac{L + M - 1}{M}
     \]
   This formula ensures that the total number of new coins across all friends is at least \( L \).

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program checks if the total number of coins gifted by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the total number of different coins remaining after accounting for what Ivan already has (`N - K`).
   - If \( M * \text{min\_x} \leq N - K \), it prints `min_x`, meaning it's feasible to gift that number of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that fulfilling the gifting conditions is impossible.

### Edge Cases:
- **If \( M > N \)**: More friends than different coins, which makes it impossible to satisfy the requirement of gifting different coins.
- **If \( K + L > N \)**: If Ivan's existing coins and the required new coins exceed the total available coins, it is also impossible.

### Conclusion on Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum coins each friend needs to gift while considering the restrictions of the problem.
- Both the calculation of `min_x` and the condition check ensure that the rules of gifting different coins and meeting the minimum new coins requirement are adhered to.

Thus, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
