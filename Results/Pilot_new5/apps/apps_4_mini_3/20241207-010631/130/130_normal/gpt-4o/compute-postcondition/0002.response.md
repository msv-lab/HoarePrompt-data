The expression `min_x` is assigned the value of `(L + M - 1) // M`. The values of `L` and `M` are both integers from the input. The expression calculates the minimum integer `min_x` such that `min_x * M` is greater than or equal to `L`. The states of the other variables `N`, `K` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer, `M` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `L` is an integer, and `min_x` is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `M` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `L` is an integer, `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`.**
