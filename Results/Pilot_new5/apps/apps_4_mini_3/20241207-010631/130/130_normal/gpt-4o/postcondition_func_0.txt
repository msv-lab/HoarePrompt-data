The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from input and calculates the minimum integer x such that M * x is less than or equal to N - K. If such an x exists, it prints the value of x; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value. It handles cases where the computed minimum x might not fit within the constraints of the inputs, leading to a possible output of -1 when the conditions are not met.
