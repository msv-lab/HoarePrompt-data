To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\), which represent:
   - \(N\): The total number of different collectible coins.
   - \(M\): The number of Ivan's friends.
   - \(K\): The number of different coins Ivan already has.
   - \(L\): The minimum number of new coins that must be received.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins per Friend**:
   - `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`: This line computes the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to satisfy the requirement that at least \(L\) coins are new. It uses integer division to ensure it rounds up when necessary.
   - The condition checks whether the total number of coins each friend gifts (which is \(M \times \text{min_x}\)) is less than or equal to the available new coins \(N - K\) (the total coins minus the coins Ivan already has).

3. **Output Logic**:
   - If the condition holds true (`M * min_x <= N - K`), it means it is feasible to gift the coins, and the program outputs `min_x`.
   - If the condition fails, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the terms.

### Edge Cases:
Letâ€™s evaluate some potential edge cases to check if the program handles them correctly.

**Case 1**: Minimum inputs
- Input: `1 1 1 1`
  - Explanation: There is only one coin type, and Ivan already has it. Thus the friends cannot gift any new coins.
  - Expected output: `-1` (correctly outputs `-1`).

**Case 2**: Friends greater than coin types
- Input: `5 6 1 2`
  - Explanation: Ivan can only have a maximum of 4 new coins (since he already has 1), but needs at least 2 new coins from 6 friends.
  - Expected output: `-1` (correctly outputs `-1`).

**Case 3**: Exact available coins
- Input: `10 5 5 5`
  - Explanation: Ivan can receive 5 coins and must have 5 new ones. This means each friend must gift 1 coin: \(min_x = (5 + 5 - 1) // 5 = 1\).
  - Expected output: `1` (correctly outputs `1`).

**Case 4**: Testing with large numbers
- Input: `1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 999999999999999999 1`
  - Explanation: There are enough total coins for each friend to gift one coin, which will be new.
  - Expected output: `1` (correctly outputs `1`).

### Conclusion:
After testing various edge cases, the logic of the program appears to be valid for all cases derived from the problem description. The program accurately calculates the minimum coins needed or determines when it is impossible to satisfy the conditions.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
