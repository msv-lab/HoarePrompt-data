Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. Additionally, at this point, either `A[i][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i][j + 1]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are such that at least one of them is 1.***
