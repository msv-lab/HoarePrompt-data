Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) for each pair of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1 across all iterations of the loop. If none of the cells in any 2x2 submatrix satisfied the condition during any iteration, then `ops` remains empty.**
