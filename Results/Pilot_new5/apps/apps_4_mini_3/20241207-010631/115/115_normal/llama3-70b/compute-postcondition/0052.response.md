The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The conditions for the loop to continue are based on the values in the 2D list `A`. Since no information is provided about whether the conditions for continuing the loop were met, we assume the execution of the append operation takes place. The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged, while `ops` is updated by adding a new entry.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` has a new entry `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it.**
