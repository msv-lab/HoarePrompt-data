Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, and `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1), where `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` holds true, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it does not proceed to the next iteration, remaining in its current state.***
