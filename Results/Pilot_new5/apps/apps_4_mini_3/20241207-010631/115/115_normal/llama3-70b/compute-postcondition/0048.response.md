Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is 0. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple `(n, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ops`.***
