Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If either `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the iteration continues.***
