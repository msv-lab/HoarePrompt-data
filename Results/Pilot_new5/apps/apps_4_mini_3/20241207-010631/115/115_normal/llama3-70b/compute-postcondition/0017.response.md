The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes being made to any variables in this case, the output state remains unchanged apart from the fact that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

The previous values of the variables remain the same: `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
