The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but we know that `j` is `m - 2`, and `m` is between 2 and 50, which means `j` is between 0 and 48.

Since `ops` is not mentioned in the initial state, we will assume it exists and is an empty list prior to this operation.

The impact of the code is that it updates the list `ops` by adding a new tuple consisting of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Without the exact values of `i` and `j`, we can indicate that this operation will change `ops` by adding `(i + 1, m - 1)` since `j + 1` equals `m - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` now contains the tuple `(i + 1, m - 1)`.**
