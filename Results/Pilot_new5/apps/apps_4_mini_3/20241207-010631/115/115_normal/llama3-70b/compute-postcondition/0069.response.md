According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. The `ops` list must have more elements for the loop to execute again. Since `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed in the last iteration, they correspond to the last operation executed. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `op` must be the next operation in the `ops` list. 

Assuming there are still more operations in `ops`, the state must reflect that `op` will change to the next operation. If `ops` has `k` elements, after the last iteration which printed the `k-th` operation, `op` should be the `(k+1)-th` operation in the next iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`; `op` is the `(k+1)-th` operation in `ops`.**
