Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` (where 2 <= n, m <= 50) and a 2D list `A` of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`. It checks all 2x2 submatrices within `A` and collects the positions (1-based indices) of cells that are part of a submatrix containing at least one '1'. If the number of such positions exceeds 2500, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of collected positions followed by the positions themselves. If all cells in any 2x2 submatrix contain '1's, those positions are not included in the output. **
