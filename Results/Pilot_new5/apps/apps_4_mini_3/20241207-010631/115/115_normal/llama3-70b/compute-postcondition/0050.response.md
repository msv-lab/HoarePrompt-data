The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to stop and the next iteration to begin. In this case, since there are no changes made to the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, or `j`, the output state reflects that the loop continues without altering any variable states or values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
