The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and jump to the next iteration. In this case, we can infer that the execution is likely within a loop structure, but the specific behavior depends on the context of that loop. However, since no other variables are modified or affected by the `continue` statement, we can only state that the execution will skip the remaining part of the current iteration.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and `j` is 0, and there are no changes to the state of the variables, the output state reflects that we are simply continuing into the next iteration of a loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
