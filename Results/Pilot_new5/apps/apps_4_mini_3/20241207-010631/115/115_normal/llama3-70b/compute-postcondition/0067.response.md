According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops`. If `ops` contains more than 1 tuple, the loop can execute again for the second tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` has at least 1 tuple, and `op` is the first tuple in `ops`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `ops` must have at least 2 tuples, and `op` would then become the second tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`; `ops` must have at least 2 tuples; `op` is the second tuple in `ops`; the output is `op[0]` and `op[1]`**
