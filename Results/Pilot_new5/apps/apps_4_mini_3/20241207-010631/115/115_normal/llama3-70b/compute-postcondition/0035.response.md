According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value which is less than `m - 1` (since the loop has not yet reached this condition). Therefore, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `j` is currently less than `m - 1`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be increased by 1. Thus, the new value of `j` will be equal to its previous value plus 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, j is the next index (j + 1)**
