According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from `0` to `m - 2`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, and `j` is the current value at the end of the previous iteration. 

Since `j` is being incremented by 1 on each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. If the loop was at `j`, then for the next iteration, `j` will become `j + 1`. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `j` must be at most `m - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `j` is `m - 2`**
