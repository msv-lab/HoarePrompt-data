The execution of the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop, moving directly to the next iteration. Since `j` is mentioned as the next index, it implies that the loop is iterating over some range associated with `j`. However, the values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that we have continued to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `j` is the next index (j + 1) and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
