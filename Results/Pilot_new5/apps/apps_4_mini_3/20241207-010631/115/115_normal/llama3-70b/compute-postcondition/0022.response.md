According to the code, the loop executes `n - 1` times. The current state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 after the next iteration.

Since the loop runs while `i` is less than `n - 1`, and currently, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (which it is, since `n` is between 2 and 50). 

The variable `j` is currently `m - 2`, and since the loop only depends on the value of `i`, the value of `j` remains unchanged for the next iteration.

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `i` is now 1 while keeping the other relevant states intact.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) for each pair of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`**
