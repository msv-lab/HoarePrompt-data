Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `A[0][1]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[0][2]`, or `A[1][2]` are 1, the program state updates with the addition of the tuple (1, 2) to `ops`. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
