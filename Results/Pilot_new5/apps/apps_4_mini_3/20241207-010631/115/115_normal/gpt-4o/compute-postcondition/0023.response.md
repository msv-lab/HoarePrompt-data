According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit of the range defined by `m`. The for loop iterates from `0` to `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Since `j` is currently 0, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration, and for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be at least 2, allowing `j` to take the value of 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, operations contains the coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, j is 1**
