Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element is either 0 or 1 indicating the presence of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s from `A`, `operations` contains the coordinates of all detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, if any were found; if no 2x2 blocks were found, then `operations` remains empty and `B` remains a matrix of zeros.**
