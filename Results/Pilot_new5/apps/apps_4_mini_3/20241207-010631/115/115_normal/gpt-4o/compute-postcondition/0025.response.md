In the provided code snippet, the `operations` list is appended with a new tuple containing the values `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The variable `j` is currently set to 1, and we know that `B[i][1]`, `B[i][2]`, `B[i + 1][1]`, and `B[i + 1][2]` are all equal to 1, indicating that `i` has been defined and is such that the coordinates refer to a valid 2x2 block of 1s.

Since `j` is 1, the operation `j + 1` evaluates to 2. Thus, the new coordinates will be `(i + 1, 2)`.

The `operations` list will now include the new tuple `(i + 1, 2)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`, `j` is 1, and `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`.**
