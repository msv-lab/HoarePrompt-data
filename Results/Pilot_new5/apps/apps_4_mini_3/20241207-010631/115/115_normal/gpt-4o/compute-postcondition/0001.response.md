The code creates a new 2D list `B` that consists of `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to 0. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `operations` remain unchanged, but `B` is a newly created 2D list.

The dimensions of `B` are specifically `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers in the range of 2 to 50. Therefore, after execution, we have the following valid states:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions n x m; `operations` is an empty list; `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, all initialized to 0.**
