According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `operations` variable. For the loop to execute, `operations` must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list or an array) that contains at least one element. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but are defined as part of the program state.

To ensure the loop runs, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `operations` has at least one element. The current values of `i` and `j` do not need to be changed since they are already defined correctly. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `operations` must be a non-empty iterable**
