Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` contains the coordinates where 2x2 blocks of 1s were found in `A`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where elements are set to 1 for each position that is part of a detected 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, `j` is 0, and the elements A[i][j], A[i][j + 1], A[i + 1][j], and A[i + 1][j + 1] are all equal to 1.***
