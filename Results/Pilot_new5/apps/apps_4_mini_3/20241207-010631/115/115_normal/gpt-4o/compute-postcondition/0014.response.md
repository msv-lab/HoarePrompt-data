The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple consists of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `j` is currently `m - 1`, the new tuple will be `(i + 1, m)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `m` is greater than 2; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m; `operations` contains the values [(1, 1), (1, 2), (i + 1, m)]; `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`; `B[i][m - 1] = 1`, `B[i][m] = 1`, `B[i + 1][m - 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][m] = 1`; `j` is `m - 1`.**
