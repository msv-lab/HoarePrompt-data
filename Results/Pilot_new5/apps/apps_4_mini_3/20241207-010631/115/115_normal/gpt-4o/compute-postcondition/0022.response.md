Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, and `operations` contains the coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`. If a 2x2 block of 1s is found at coordinates (i, j), the `operations` list is updated to include the new coordinate (i + 1, j + 1), and the 2D list `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`. The variable `j` remains 0.***
