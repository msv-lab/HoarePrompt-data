Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`
- `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is 1
- `B[n - 1][0]` is 1
- `B[n - 1][1]` is 1
- `B[n][0]` is 1
- `B[n][1]` is 1 if `A[n - 1][0]`, `A[n - 1][1]`, `A[n][0]`, and `A[n][1]` are all equal to 1.

Now, examining the code:

```
B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```

This code assigns the value `1` to a 2x2 block in the matrix `B` starting from the coordinates `(i, j)` and extending to `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i = n - 1` and `j = 1`, this specifically updates:

- `B[n - 1][1]` (which is already 1)
- `B[n - 1][2]` (newly set to 1)
- `B[n][1]` (which is already 1)
- `B[n][2]` (newly set to 1)

Since we only know `n` is at least 2, we do not have direct specific values for `n` and `m`, but we know that `B` is a 2D list and that the updated values at indices `(n - 1, 2)` and `(n, 2)` will now be 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is updated such that `B[n - 1][2]` is 1 and `B[n][2]` is 1, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1.**
