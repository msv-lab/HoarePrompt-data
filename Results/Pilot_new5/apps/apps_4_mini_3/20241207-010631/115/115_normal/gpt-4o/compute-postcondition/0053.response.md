According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1, and the loop can run again as long as `m` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` must be a list of coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A` or empty, `j` is 1.**
