The code snippet `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` will append a tuple to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are both 0, so `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 1. Therefore, the tuple `(1, 1)` will be added to the `operations` list. 

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `B`) are not affected by this operation. 

The output state will reflect that a new operation has been added to the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m; `operations` contains the value [(1, 1)]; `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
