Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0. The current values are: `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, indicating a detected 2x2 block of 1s at coordinates `(i, j)` in `A`.***
