Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, and all values of `A[i][j]` are equal to the corresponding values of `B[i][j]` for all valid indices, indicating that all elements in the 2D list `A` are equal to those in the 2D list `B`. If no discrepancies were found, the function completes successfully without errors.**
