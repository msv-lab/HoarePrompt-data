According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the condition `j < m - 1` must still hold true. This means that `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, `B` is updated such that `B[n - 1][2]` and `B[n][2]` are set to 1, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 3, and `(n, 2)` is appended to `operations`**
