To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the program.

### Problem Breakdown:

Sofia is drawing \( n \) squares, and she needs to minimize the number of segments she has to draw with a ruler without a guide. The key points in the problem description are:
1. Each square consists of 4 segments.
2. If a square can use an existing segment as a guide, Sofia does not need to draw it with a ruler.
3. The program should calculate the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler based on the number of squares \( n \).

### Mathematical Insight:

When drawing squares:
- For 1 square, she needs to draw 2 segments with a ruler (the first two segments).
- For subsequent squares, if they are aligned with the first square, she can use the existing segments as guides.

The relationship can be derived based on the dimensions of the squares:
- The number of segments needed with a ruler can be minimized by optimizing the arrangement of squares.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program does the following:
1. It reads an integer \( n \) which represents the number of squares.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that aims to find the minimum number of segments needed to be drawn with a ruler.
3. Inside `func_1`, it iterates through possible widths \( a \) (up to \( \sqrt{n} \)), calculates the corresponding height \( b \) needed to fit \( n \) squares, and computes the segments required for each configuration.
4. It keeps track of the minimum segments needed.

### Correctness Check:

To assess if the program meets the problem requirements:
- The program correctly identifies that Sofia can use segments from previously drawn squares to minimize the number of ruler-drawn segments.
- The calculation \( 2 * (a + b) \) corresponds to the total segments needed for a given configuration of squares.
- The function iterates through \( a \) from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \), ensuring all configurations are considered.

This leads to:
- For any configuration of squares, the program accurately considers the minimum segments needed using the logic laid out in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler given \( n \) squares, based on the logic derived from the problem description. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
