The variable `min_segments_needed` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, indicating that it now represents positive infinity. The value of `n` remains unchanged as its range is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity.**
