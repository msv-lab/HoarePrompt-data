The variable `b` is assigned the value of `(n + a - 1) // a`. Given that `a` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(n + 1 - 1) // 1`, which is simply `n // 1`, and therefore `b` will be equal to `n`. 

The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is updated to be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`.**
