The variable `segments_needed` is assigned the value `2 * (a + b)`. Given that the initial state specifies `a` is 1 and `b` is equal to `n`, we can substitute these values into the expression. Thus, we have:

- `a` is 1
- `b` is equal to `n`

Calculating `segments_needed` gives us:

- `segments_needed = 2 * (1 + n)`

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`, `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (1 + n)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`, `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (1 + n)`**.
