The `min_segments_needed` variable is updated with the minimum value between its previous value and `segments_needed`. Given that `segments_needed` is equal to `4 + n`, the new value of `min_segments_needed` will depend on its previous value and the calculation of `segments_needed`. 

Since `min_segments_needed` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and `segments_needed`, we can express this as:
- `min_segments_needed` = min(previous value of `min_segments_needed`, 4 + n)

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `segments_needed` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `a` is 2; `b` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `segments_needed` is `4 + n`; `min_segments_needed` is the minimum of its previous value and `4 + n`.**
