To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program is designed to turn over `n` skewers, with `k` skewers on each side being affected by each turn. The goal is to turn over all skewers using the minimal number of actions.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes two integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the number of skewers and the number of skewers affected on each side of the skewer turned.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes an empty list `positions`.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the skewers, starting from 1, and increments `i` by `2 * k + 1` on each iteration. 
   - The skewers turned are collected into the `positions` list.
   - Finally, it prints the number of operations and the indices of the skewers turned.

3. **Understanding the Increment**:
   - The increment `i += 2 * k + 1` is intended to skip over the ranges of skewers that are turned over by each skewer turned.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Case When `k = 0`**:
   - For `k = 0`, turning skewer `i` only affects `i`. Thus, every skewer needs to be turned individually.
   - The program will attempt to turn every `2 * 0 + 1 = 1` skewer, and it will turn skewers `1, 2, 3, ..., n`, resulting in `n` actions.
   - **Expected Output**: If `n = 5`, the output should be:
     ```
     5
     1 2 3 4 5
     ```
   - **Actual Output**: The program will output:
     ```
     3
     1 3 5
     ```
   - This means that skewers `2` and `4` will remain unturned, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program fails to turn over all skewers when `k = 0`. Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
