Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the requirements of the problem description correctly. 

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
1. **Turning Over Logic**: The program attempts to determine the skewers that need to be turned over by incrementing the index `i` by `2 * k + 1` on each iteration. This means that it is skipping over skewers that would be turned over due to the influence of the `k` skewers on either side.

2. **Failure to Cover All Skewers**: The approach taken in the program will not necessarily ensure that all skewers are turned over effectively. For example, if `n` is small and `k` is also small, the program may skip over some skewers that need to be turned.

3. **Missing Specific Cases**: For specific inputs, such as `n = 6` and `k = 2`, the program will only provide the output `1` and `6`, which would leave skewers `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` unturned, contradicting the requirement to turn over all skewers.

### Example Case:
- For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the program will output `2` and `1 6`, but it fails to turn over skewers `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` properly, which must also be turned in the process.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
