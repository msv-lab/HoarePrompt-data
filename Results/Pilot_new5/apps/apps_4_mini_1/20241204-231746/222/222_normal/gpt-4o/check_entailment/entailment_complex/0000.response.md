To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We have `n` skewers, and turning skewer `i` also turns `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right.
2. The goal is to turn over all skewers with the minimal number of actions.
3. We need to find how many turns are necessary and which skewers to turn.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes an empty list `positions` and starts with the skewer index `i = 1`.
- Within a loop, it appends the skewer index `i` to the `positions` list and then increments `i` by `2*k + 1`.
- The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n`.

### Understanding the Increment:
- The increment `i += 2*k + 1` suggests that each time we turn a skewer, it affects `k` skewers to the left and `k` to the right, thus covering a total of `2*k + 1` skewers in one action.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Minimal Actions**: The program selects skewers in a way that maximizes the number of skewers turned with each action. By starting at `1` and skipping to `1 + (2*k + 1)` for the next skewer, it ensures that each selected skewer does not overlap with the previously turned skewers.
  
2. **All Skewers Turned**: After turning the skewers at the indices produced by this function, all skewers from `1` to `n` will be turned because:
   - For small values of `k`, skewer positions will be selected in such a way that they ensure no skewer is missed.
   - For `k = 0`, each skewer gets turned individually, which is the expected behavior.
   - For larger values of `k`, the pattern of increments ensures that all skewers will be turned with minimal overlap.
  
3. **Output**: The program prints the number of actions and the indices of the skewers selected for turning, which matches the output format specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It ensures that all skewers are turned using the minimal number of actions by strategically selecting which skewers to turn based on the close-turned-over mechanism defined by `k`. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.

Correctness: **True**
