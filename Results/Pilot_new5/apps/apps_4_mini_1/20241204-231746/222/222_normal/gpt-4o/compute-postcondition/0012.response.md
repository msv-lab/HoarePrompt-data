The code `print(len(positions))` outputs the length of the list `positions`. The length is determined by the number of values in the list, which has been derived based on the initial conditions given. Since `positions` is a list containing the first `m` values derived from the sequence `1, 1 + (2*k + 1), 1 + 2*(2*k + 1), ..., 1 + (m-1)*(2*k + 1)`, the length of `positions` is equal to `m`.

The variable `i` is greater than `n`, and the conditions pertaining to `positions` and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`positions` is a list containing the first `m` values derived from the sequence, `i` is greater than `n`, and the length of `positions` is `m`.**
