The variable `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer in the range [0, 1000], the value of `2 * k + 1` will be at least 1 (when k = 0) and at most 2001 (when k = 1000). Consequently, `i` will increase from its initial value of 1 by an amount between 1 and 2001.

However, since `k` is not specified, the exact new value of `i` cannot be pinpointed, but we can express it in terms of `k`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is equal to `1 + 2*k + 1`**
