The code `positions.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `positions`. Given that `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`, this value will be appended to `positions`.

The initial state indicates:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`
- `positions` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 + 2*k`
- `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`

After executing the code, `positions` will now include the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected.

The output state thus reflects the updated `positions` list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`, `positions` is a list containing the values 1, `2 + 2*k`, and `4 + 4*k`, `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`**
