The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 1000) and `k` (between 0 and 1000) and constructs a list of integers starting from 1, incrementing by `2*k + 1` until exceeding `n`. It prints the length of this list and the elements in it as a space-separated string, but does not return any values.
