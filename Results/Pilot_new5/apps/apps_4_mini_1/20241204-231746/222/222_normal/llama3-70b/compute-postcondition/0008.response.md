The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` calculates a new value based on the existing values of `i` and `k`. Specifically, it computes the expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, where `i` is currently 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000. 

Let's break this down step by step:
1. `k * 2` will yield a value that is at least 0 (for k = 0) and at most 2000 (for k = 1000).
2. Adding 1 to `k * 2` gives a range of results from 1 to 2001.
3. Multiplying this result by `i`, which is 2, gives a range from 2 to 4002.
4. Finally, adding 1 to this product results in a final range from 3 to 4003.

The variable `res` will include this new value, but since `res` already includes the values 1 and `k * 2 + 2`, we can't determine its exact state without knowing `k`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after the execution of the code, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` includes the values 1, `k * 2 + 2`, and a new value equal to `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.**
