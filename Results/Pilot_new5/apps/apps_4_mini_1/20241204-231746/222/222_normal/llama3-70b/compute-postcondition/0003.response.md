According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `l`. The variable `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be greater than 0. 

The conditions for `l` to be greater than 0 are as follows:
1. The denominator `(k * 2 + 1)` must be greater than 0, which it always is since `k` is non-negative (0 <= k <= 1000).
2. The numerator `n + k - 1` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `k` is non-negative (0 <= k <= 1000), the minimum value of `n + k - 1` is 0 (when n = 1 and k = 0), which makes `l` equal to 0 in that case.

Therefore, to ensure that `l` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n + k - 1` is at least 1. This implies that at least one of these conditions must hold true:
- If `n` is at least 1 (which it is by definition), then `k` must be 0 or more. Hence, `k` must not be less than `1 - n` to ensure `n + k - 1` is greater than 0.

In conclusion, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `l` must be greater than 0, which means `n + k - 1` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
