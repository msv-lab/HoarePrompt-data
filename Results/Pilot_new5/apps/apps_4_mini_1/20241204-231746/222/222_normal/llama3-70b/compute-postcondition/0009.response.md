The loop iterates `l` times, where `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. In each iteration, the loop appends a value to the `res` list based on the current index `i`, specifically `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

If the loop executes a total of `l` times, the values in `res` will be the first `l` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from 1 with a common difference of `(k * 2 + 1)`. 

After the loop executes:
- `res` will include the values from `1` to `l * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, incremented by `(k * 2 + 1)`.
- The final value of `i` will be `l - 1`.
- If `l` is zero, the loop does not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is the final value of `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `i` is `l - 1`, and `res` includes the values from `1` to `l * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` with a common difference of `(k * 2 + 1)`.**
