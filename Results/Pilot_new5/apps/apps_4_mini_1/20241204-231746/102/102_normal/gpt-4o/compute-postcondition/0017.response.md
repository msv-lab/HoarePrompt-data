To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state and then the impact of the code.

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * a`, `x` is `2`.

The code given is:
```
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

1. The variable `x` has a fixed value of `2`.
2. The expression for `y` involves the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. We compute `x * a`, which is `2 * a`.
3. The value for `y` will be determined by the result of `(n - 2 * a) // b`.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * a`, we understand that the expression inside the parentheses `(n - 2 * a)` is non-negative. Hence, `y` will be an integer (the result of integer division).

The output state should reflect that `y` has been calculated based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The other variables, `n`, `a`, and `b`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * a`; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b.**
