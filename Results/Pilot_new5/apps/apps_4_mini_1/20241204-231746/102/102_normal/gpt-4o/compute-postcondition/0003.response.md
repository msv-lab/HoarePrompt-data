According to the code, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer, as the range function needs a valid starting point. Since `a` is within 1 to 10,000,000, it is guaranteed to be positive, so `n // a + 1` will also be at least 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` should be at least `0`, and `x` will start at `0` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0**
