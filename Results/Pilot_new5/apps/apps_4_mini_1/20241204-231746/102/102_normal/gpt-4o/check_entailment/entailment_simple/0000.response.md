Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the total amount of money Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively. This aligns with the input format described in the problem.

2. **Iterative Approach**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over possible quantities of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`). The loop runs from `0` to `n // a`, which ensures that it considers all possible quantities of Ber-Cola that Vasya could buy given his budget.

3. **Condition Checking**: Within the loop, for each value of `x`, the program checks whether the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola can be evenly divided by the cost of Bars bars (`b`). This is done using the expression `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, which is essential for determining if `y`, the number of Bars bars, can be a non-negative integer.

4. **Output**: If a suitable pair of `(x, y)` is found that satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b = n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If the loop completes without finding any valid pair, it outputs "NO".

5. **Correctness for All Cases**: The method used in the program effectively checks all combinations of `x` (from 0 to the maximum possible number of Ber-Cola bottles that can be bought with `n` burles). If there exists a combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`, the program will find it before exiting the loop. Conversely, if no such combination exists, the program correctly identifies this and prints "NO".

Overall, the program accurately and efficiently determines whether Vasya can spend his money exactly as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program fulfills the problem requirements correctly for all possible inputs within the defined constraints.
