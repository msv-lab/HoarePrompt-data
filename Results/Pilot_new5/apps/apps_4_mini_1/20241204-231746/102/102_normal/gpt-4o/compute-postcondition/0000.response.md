The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n` and maintain the conditions for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000**
