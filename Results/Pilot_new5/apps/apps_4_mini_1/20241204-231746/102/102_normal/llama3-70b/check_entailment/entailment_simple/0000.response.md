Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from the input: `n`, the total amount of money Vasya has; `a`, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola; and `b`, the cost of one Bars bar. These inputs align with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Ber-Cola Bottles**: The program uses a for loop that iterates over the possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`), ranging from 0 to the maximum number of bottles that can be bought with the available money, which is `n // a`. This is a correct approach because it allows for all combinations of purchasing Ber-Cola bottles.

3. **Calculating Bars Bars**: Within the loop, the program calculates the potential number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be purchased after spending a certain amount on Ber-Cola. The calculation `y = (n - x * a) // b` determines how many Bars bars can be bought with the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola, ensuring that `y` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the total cost `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If this condition is satisfied, it prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`, indicating a valid combination of purchases that meets the exact budget.

5. **Output for No Valid Combination**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination of `x` and `y`, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases, including when one of the costs is much larger than the budget, or when the budget is just equal to the cost of either item, and checks for valid integer solutions.

Overall, the logic used in the program covers all necessary scenarios as described in the problem statement, ensuring it will correctly determine whether Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on Ber-Cola and Bars bars. Therefore, the program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description.
