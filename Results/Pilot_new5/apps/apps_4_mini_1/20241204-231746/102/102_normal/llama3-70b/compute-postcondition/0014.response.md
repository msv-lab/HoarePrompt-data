The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. As such, the values of the variables are not altered, but the program will stop execution. Therefore, we still retain the states of the variables as they were before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least `1`, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
