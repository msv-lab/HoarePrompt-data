The code `exit()` is called, which does not modify any variable values but terminates the execution of the program immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `a`, `x`, `y` are affected by this command. The output from the previous code, which includes the print statements for the values '2' and `(n - 2 * a) // b`, is not executed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least 2; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`; program execution has been terminated.**
