According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to 30. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 30. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would be at its largest value for this loop, which is 30, since the loop runs as long as `i` is less than 31.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 31, but this would exit the loop because the condition `i < 31` would no longer hold true.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration are:
- `n` remains the same as it is within the defined range (1 ≤ n ≤ 30).
- `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` are unchanged as they depend on the values of `c[]`, which are not specified to change for the next iteration.

Since `i` is already at the end of its range, it cannot execute again. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2); `i` is 31**
