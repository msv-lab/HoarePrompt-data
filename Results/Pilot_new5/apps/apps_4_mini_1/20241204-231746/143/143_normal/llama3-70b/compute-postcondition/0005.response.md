According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is within the specified range and `j` can take values from 0 to `n-1`. Since `i` is already set to 1 and does not affect the loop's execution directly, we need to consider the loop variables. Before the loop starts, `j` needs to be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range defined by `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
