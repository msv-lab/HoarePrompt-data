The variable `dp` is assigned a list of size `L + 1`, where each element is initialized to `float('inf')`, indicating that it is set to infinity. The previous constraints on `n` and `L` are not changed by this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, with each element initialized to `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, with each element initialized to `float('inf')`.**
