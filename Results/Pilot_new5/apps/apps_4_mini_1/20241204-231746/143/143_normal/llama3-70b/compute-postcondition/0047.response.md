Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `vol` is 3; `j` is 2; if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value between `dp[3]` and `dp[2] + costs[2]`, and `dp[2]` remains the minimum value calculated from all valid updates during the loop executions.***
