The value of `vol` is assigned the result of the expression `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, we can calculate `vol` as follows:

`vol = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`

The values of the other variables (`n`, `L`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will update only the value of `vol`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**.
