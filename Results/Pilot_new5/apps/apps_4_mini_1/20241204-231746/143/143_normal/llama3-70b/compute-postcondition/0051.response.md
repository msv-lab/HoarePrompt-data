The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `c`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers representing the costs of bottles, where each cost `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9.

The specific output and return value have not been provided in the prompt. Therefore, I am unable to summarize the outputs based on the provided output specification. To properly describe the functionality, the expected output of the function needs to be defined.

However, based on the given parameters, the basic functionality of the function can be outlined as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of integers `c` representing the costs of bottles.**
