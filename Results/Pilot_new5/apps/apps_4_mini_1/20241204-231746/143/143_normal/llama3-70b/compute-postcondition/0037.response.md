Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[2]` is the minimum value calculated from all valid updates during the loop executions, `vol` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
