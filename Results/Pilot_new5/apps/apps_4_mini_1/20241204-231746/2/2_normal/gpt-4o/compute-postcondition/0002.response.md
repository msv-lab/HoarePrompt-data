Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and returns the sum of its digits. The function correctly handles all positive integers within the specified range and performs no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, as it assumes the input will always be a valid positive integer. **
