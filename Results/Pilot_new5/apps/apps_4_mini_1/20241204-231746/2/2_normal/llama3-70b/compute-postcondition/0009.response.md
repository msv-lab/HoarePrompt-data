According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `x`. The loop iterates from 1 to `x`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2. Additionally, `x` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_num` is set to 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 1.**
