The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18). It calculates the number between 1 and `x` that has the highest sum of its digits, and prints that number. If there are multiple numbers with the same maximum digit sum, it will print the first one encountered. However, the function does not handle any invalid input cases (e.g., if the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range).
