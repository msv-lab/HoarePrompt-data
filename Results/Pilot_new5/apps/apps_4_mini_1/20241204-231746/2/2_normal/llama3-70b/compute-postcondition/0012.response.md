The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `max_num` was 1, so it is updated to 2. The states of the other variables (`x`, `max_sum`, `i`, and `digit_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 2; `max_num` is 2; `i` is 2; `digit_sum` is 2.**
