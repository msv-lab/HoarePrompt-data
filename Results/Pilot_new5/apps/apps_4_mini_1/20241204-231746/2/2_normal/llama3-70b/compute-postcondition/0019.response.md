The loop calculates the maximum digit sum of numbers from 1 to `x` and records the corresponding number. After all iterations of the loop, `max_sum` will contain the highest digit sum found among all integers from 1 to `x`, and `max_num` will be the integer that produced this maximum digit sum. 

If `x` is 1, the loop will execute once, resulting in `max_sum` being 1 (from the digit sum of 1) and `max_num` being 1. 

If `x` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `x` times, and `max_sum` will be at least 1 (for `x` ≥ 1) and can potentially reach values higher than 1 depending on the values of `x`. The maximum digit sum typically occurs at higher values of `x`, often for numbers with multiple 9s in their digits.

Thus, after executing all iterations:
- `max_sum` will be the maximum digit sum obtained from any number from 1 to `x`.
- `max_num` will be the number corresponding to that maximum digit sum.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum of numbers from 1 to `x`; `max_num` is the number that produced `max_sum`.**
