The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are changed or affected, and the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state indicates that no values are updated since the program exits, but the previous relevant information remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is unchanged; 'NO' is printed and the program has exited.**
