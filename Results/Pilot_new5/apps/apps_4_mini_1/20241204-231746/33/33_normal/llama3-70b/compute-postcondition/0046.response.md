In the given code snippet, `curr_lat` is updated by adding the result of `t / 111.195` to its current value. The variable `t` is an integer, and `curr_lat` remains within a valid latitude range, which generally ranges from -90 to 90 degrees.

The output state will reflect that `curr_lat` has increased by the computed value of `t / 111.195`. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 1, it does not directly affect the calculation of `curr_lat`. Additionally, since `dir` is an input string, it remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195` while remaining within the valid latitude range.**
