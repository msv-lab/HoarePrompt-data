The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from the `input()` function, where `input()` captures a string entered by the user and `split()` divides it into two parts based on whitespace. The values of `t` and `dir` will depend on the user's input. The value of `n` remains unchanged and `curr_lat` is still 90. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `curr_lat` while indicating that `t` and `dir` are now assigned input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**
