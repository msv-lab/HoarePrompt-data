`curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its current value. Since `curr_lat` is initially 90 and `t` is an input integer, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 - (t / 111.195)`. The values of `n` and `dir` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is equal to `90 - (t / 111.195)`, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and `dir` is equal to 'South'.**
