The code snippet provided prints 'NO' to the console. Since `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the conditions state that the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, because the specific check for `curr_lat` being -90 and `dir` not being 'North' applies, it will not terminate the program; instead, it will print 'NO'. 

The output state thus reflects that 'NO' has been printed, but no variables have changed in value. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50); `curr_lat` is 90; `dir` is not 'South'; 'NO' is printed to the console.**
