The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It doesn't change the value of any variables. The variables `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` remain unchanged in this state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is within the valid range of -90 to 90 and is currently -90, `dir` is not 'North', and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
