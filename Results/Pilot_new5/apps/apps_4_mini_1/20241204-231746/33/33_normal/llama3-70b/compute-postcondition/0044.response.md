The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values from the input, which consists of two space-separated values. The value of `t` will be whatever input the user provides, and the value of `dir` will be the second input. The value of `n` remains unchanged (greater than 1), and `curr_lat` also remains within the valid latitude range. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `t` and `dir`, but not any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range.**
