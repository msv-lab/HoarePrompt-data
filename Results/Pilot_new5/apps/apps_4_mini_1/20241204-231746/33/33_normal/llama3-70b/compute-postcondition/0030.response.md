The code snippet `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` modifies the variable `curr_lat` by decreasing it by the value of `t` divided by `111.195`. The values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` are still valid and will remain unchanged in the output state.

- `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.
- The values of `n` and `dir` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.**
