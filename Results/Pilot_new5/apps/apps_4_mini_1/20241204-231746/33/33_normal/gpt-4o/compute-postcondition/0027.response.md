Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `position` is within the range 0 to 20000, there are no changes made to `position`, `valid`, or `dir`.***
