Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `position` is the final position after all movements, constrained between 0 and 20000; `valid` is True only if all movement conditions were satisfied during the loop execution; otherwise, `valid` is False. If `position` never goes below 0 or above 20000, then `valid` remains True; otherwise, it is set to False during the iterations. `t` is the last integer input processed, and `dir` is the last direction processed.**
