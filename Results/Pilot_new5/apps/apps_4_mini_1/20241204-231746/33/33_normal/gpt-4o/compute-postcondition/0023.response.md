Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `t`, `valid` is set to False, and it holds true that the sum of `position` and `t` is greater than 20000. If `dir` is not 'South', then `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.***
