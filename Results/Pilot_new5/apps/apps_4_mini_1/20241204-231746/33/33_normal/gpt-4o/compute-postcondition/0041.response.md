Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50. If `dir` is 'North', then `valid` remains False, and `position` is either updated to 20000 - `t` (if it was initially 20000 and `t` â‰¤ 20000) or to 0 - `t` (if it was initially 0 and `t` > 0). If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`. For any other direction, `n`, `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` retain their values, while `valid` remains set to False, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.***
