The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `count` is the next value from `color_count.values()` that is less than or equal to `k`, there is at least one more value in `color_count.values()` that can be iterated over, and `can_distribute` is False.
