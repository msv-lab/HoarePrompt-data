The function accepts two integers `n` (representing the number of balloons) and `k` (representing the number of friends), along with a string `s` (representing the colors of the balloons). It counts the occurrences of each color and checks if it is possible to distribute the balloons to friends such that no friend receives more than `k` balloons of any color. The function prints 'YES' if the distribution is possible and 'NO' if at least one color has more than `k` occurrences.
