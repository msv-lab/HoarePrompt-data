The code assigns the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map(int, input().split())`. The specific values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are taken from user input and will replace the previous values. The constraints still hold that `n` is always even and within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), `m` is within the same range, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than \(n \cdot m\). 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an input integer (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is an input integer (0 ≤ k < n·m)**
