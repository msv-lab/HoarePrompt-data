To simulate the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the given initial state and the code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer (even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `m` is an input integer (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9)
- `k` is now `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and is greater than or equal to `n - 1`
- The current value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2.

The code:
```
print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
```

Now, let's break down the computations based on the initial state.

1. The expression `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` calculates the remainder when `(k - n + 1)` is divided by `(n - 1)`.
2. The expression `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1)` performs integer division of `(k - n + 1)` by `(n - 1)`.

Given that `k` is at least `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, we can derive that:
- The first printed value will be `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`.
- The second printed value will be `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.

The exact numerical results depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`, but we can summarize the output state in a general form given the constraints:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an input integer (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is now `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and greater than or equal to `n - 1; the printed values are (n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1) and ((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)`**.
