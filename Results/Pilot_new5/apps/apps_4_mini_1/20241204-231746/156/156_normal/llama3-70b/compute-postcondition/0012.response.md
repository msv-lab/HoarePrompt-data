The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even integer ranging from 2 to \(10^9\), `m` is an integer also ranging from 2 to \(10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer that is less than the product \(n \cdot m\). The function first adjusts `k` by taking `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. It then processes `k` to determine which values to print based on its adjusted value.

The output behavior of the function is defined based on the value of `k`:
1. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`.
2. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it computes and prints two values based on the adjusted `k`: \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\) and \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\).
3. If `k` is at least `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `1` and `2`.

The annotations indicate that the inputs are handled correctly and describe the output under various conditions. However, they lack clarity on the specific output values for certain ranges of `k`. The function does not provide any return value; it only prints results to the console.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n` (even), `m`, and `k`, adjusts `k`, and prints specific coordinate-like values based on its adjusted value in relation to `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`; if `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it prints calculated values based on `k`; otherwise, it prints `(1, 2)`. The function does not return any values, only prints output. **
