The variable `remaining_steps` is calculated as the remainder of the expression `(k - (n - 1))` divided by `(m - 1)`. This value is used to compute the value of `col`. The variable `col` is then assigned the value `2 + remaining_steps`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9; `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is the integer division of (k - (n - 1)) by (m - 1); `remaining_steps` is the remainder of (k - (n - 1)) divided by (m - 1); `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`; `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`.**
