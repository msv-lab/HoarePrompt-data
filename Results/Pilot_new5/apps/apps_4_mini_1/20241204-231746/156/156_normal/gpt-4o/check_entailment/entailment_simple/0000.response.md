To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze if the function `func_1` accurately computes Lara's position after `k` moves in the specified snake-like pattern.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Moves (First Column)**:
   - The first `n-1` moves will always be down the first column from (1,1) to (n,1). 
   - If `k < n - 1`, it correctly returns the position `(k + 1, 1)`, which reflects that Lara is still in the first column.

2. **After the First Column**:
   - If `k >= n - 1`, the program adjusts `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, which allows it to calculate moves beyond the first column.
   - The number of full rows traversed (`full_rows`) is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`. Each complete row traversal (left or right) consists of `m - 1` cells.

3. **Remaining Steps**:
   - The remaining steps in the current row traversal are calculated with `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`.

4. **Snake Pattern Logic**:
   - The program determines the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd:
     - If `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving in a rightward direction (second column onwards).
     - If `full_rows` is odd, she is moving in a leftward direction.

5. **Position Calculation**:
   - The calculations for `row` and `col` based on `remaining_steps` and `full_rows` ensure that the computed position aligns with the specified snake-like movement:
     - For even `full_rows`, Lara's position is computed as `(n - full_rows, 2 + remaining_steps)`.
     - For odd `full_rows`, it is `(n - full_rows, m - remaining_steps)`.

### Conclusion:
- The program handles the edge cases of the limits on `k`, as it ensures that `0 â‰¤ k < n * m` and it correctly determines Lara's position for both small and large values of `n` and `m`.
- The problem description is fulfilled as the function accurately models the described movement pattern and calculates the correct final position.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
