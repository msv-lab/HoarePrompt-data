The code snippet assigns a new value to `remaining_steps` based on the modulus operation of `k` with respect to `(m - 1)`. The previous value of `k` was `k - (n - 1)`, so now we calculate `remaining_steps` as follows:

1. `k` has been modified to `k - (n - 1)` which is still valid and will be used in the calculation for `remaining_steps`.
2. The calculation for `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, where `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`.

Thus, `remaining_steps` becomes `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and `n` is always even; `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows = (k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1); `remaining_steps = (k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1)`**.
