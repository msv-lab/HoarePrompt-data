To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it accurately computes Lara's position after `k` moves in the dungeon represented by an `n x m` matrix.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Initial Move Count:** If `k < n - 1`, the program correctly returns the position `(k + 1, 1)` which corresponds to moving down the first column.
2. **Beyond Initial Moves:** When `k >= n - 1`, the code subtracts the initial downward moves (`k -= n - 1`), and then calculates how many full rows of movements are completed and the remaining steps to take:
   - `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` calculates how many complete horizontal movements (across rows) have been completed.
   - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` calculates steps left in the current horizontal row.
3. **Row and Column Calculation:**
   - The row is determined by `n - full_rows` which attempts to find the current row based on the number of completed rows.
   - The column is derived from whether the current row is even or odd:
     - For even rows, it moves right from column 2.
     - For odd rows, it moves left from column `m`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Inputs:** When `n = 2`, `m = 2`, and `k = 0`. This should return `(1, 1)`, which it does correctly.
2. **Full Traversal:** What happens when `k` is equal to `n * m - 1`, the maximum possible value for `k`? The program should return the last cell `(2, 2)` for a `2x2` matrix.
3. **Movement Pattern:** The program relies on the assumption that `n` is always even, but it should still accurately reflect the last position after a full traversal in cases where `k` lands in the middle of a transition.

### Test Case to Check:
Let's check the scenario where Lara makes a full traversal and we see if the end position is accurate.

- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11` (the last possible movement should bring Lara to `(1, 2)`).
- For `k = 10`, after 10 moves, she should be at `(2, 1)`.

### Observations:
- The calculation of the `row` in the else clause might not properly handle the transition between rows, especially when considering the final moves.
- The logic for determining the column based on odd/even rows may incorrectly assign positions if the calculations for full rows and remaining steps don't align correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program has the potential to provide incorrect outputs for certain values of `k`, particularly as it transitions between rows. Given this logic, there exists a situation where the final computed position does not match the expected position per the movement description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly map the final position in cases where `k` leads Lara into the transition regions between rows, particularly in edge cases around the maximum `k` values.
