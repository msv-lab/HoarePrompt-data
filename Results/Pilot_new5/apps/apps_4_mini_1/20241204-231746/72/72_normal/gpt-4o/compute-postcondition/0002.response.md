The value of `y` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged and remain as assigned integers from input, while the value of `x` is also unchanged. The output will reflect the new value of `y` after the decrement. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned specific integers from input; `y` is decreased by 1.**
