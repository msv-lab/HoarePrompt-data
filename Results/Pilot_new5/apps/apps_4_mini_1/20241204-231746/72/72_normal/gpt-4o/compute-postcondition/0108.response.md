The variable `direction` is assigned the value -1. This assignment does not affect the other variables since they are either previously defined or are not influenced by this new assignment. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 2; `k` retains its previous state; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is incremented by 1; `row` is incremented by `direction`, where `direction` is -1.**
