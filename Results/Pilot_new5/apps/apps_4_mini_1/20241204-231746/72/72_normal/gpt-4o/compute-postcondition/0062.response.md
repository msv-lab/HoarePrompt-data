The code `max_questions -= 1` decrements the value of `max_questions` by 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `sergei_questions`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
