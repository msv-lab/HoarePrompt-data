The value of `row` is increased by 2. Since `row` was increased by 1 in the initial state, its new value becomes its previous value plus 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 2; `k` retains its previous state; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 2; `row` is increased by 3 (previously increased by 1 and then by 2).**
