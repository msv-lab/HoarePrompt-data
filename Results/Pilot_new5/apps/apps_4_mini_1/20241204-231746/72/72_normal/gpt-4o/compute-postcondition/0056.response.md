Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
