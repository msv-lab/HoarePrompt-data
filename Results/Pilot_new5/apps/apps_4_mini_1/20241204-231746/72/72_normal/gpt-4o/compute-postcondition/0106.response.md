The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1 due to the line of code `max_questions += 1`. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `col` is 2, and if conditions related to `row` and `col` are met, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, but those conditions do not directly affect the state of `max_questions`. 

Since `max_questions` has been changed but the exact previous value is unknown, we state that `max_questions` is now one greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is incremented by 1.**
