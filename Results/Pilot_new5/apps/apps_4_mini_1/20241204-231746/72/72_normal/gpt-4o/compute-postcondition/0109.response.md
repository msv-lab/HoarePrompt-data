The value of `row` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `row` is `row + direction`, where `direction` is -1. Therefore, the new value of `row` will be `(row + direction) - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 2; `k` retains its previous state; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is incremented by 1; `row` is `(row + direction) - 2`, where `direction` is -1.**
