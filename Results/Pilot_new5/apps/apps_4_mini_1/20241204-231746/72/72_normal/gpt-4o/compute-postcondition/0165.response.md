Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 2, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 2`. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` equals -1, then `row` is increased by 2.***
