Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, and `y` is one less than its initial value. If `direction` equals 1, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the number of times the loop executed plus 1, and `row` is one greater than its previous value. If `row` equals `n`, then `col` is set to `y`, `row` is updated to `n - 1`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `col` is 0, `max_questions` is adjusted by decreasing it by 1, and if `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 2` and `direction` is set to 1.***
