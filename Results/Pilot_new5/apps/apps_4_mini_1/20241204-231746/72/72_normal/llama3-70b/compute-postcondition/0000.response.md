The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the input provided by the user. The function `map(int, input().split())` reads a single line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` in that order. Since the specific values for these variables are not given, they remain as integers constrained by the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`.**
