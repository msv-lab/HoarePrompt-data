The variable `max_asked` is initially defined as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. The code then calculates `min_asked` as the maximum of 1 and `max_asked - (n - 1)`. Since `max_asked` is dependent on `k` and `n`, we need to evaluate `max_asked` first.

1. Calculate `max_asked`: 
   Since `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `max_asked` will be calculated as an integer value based on the formula.

2. Calculate `min_asked`: 
   After determining `max_asked`, `min_asked` will be set to the maximum of 1 and the result of `max_asked - (n - 1)`. 

No other variables are directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects these changes where `min_asked` now has a new value based on the calculations performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `max_asked` is equal to (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n), `min_asked` is equal to max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))**
