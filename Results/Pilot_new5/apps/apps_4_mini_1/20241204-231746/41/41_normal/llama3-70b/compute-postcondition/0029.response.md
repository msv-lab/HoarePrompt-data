According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and iterates until `j < n`. Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `i + 3`. 

Also, the condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, as we are assuming that `n` is greater than `i + 2` from the previous state.

So, we need to adjust the values accordingly. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `j` is `i + 3` with `n` greater than `i + 3**.
