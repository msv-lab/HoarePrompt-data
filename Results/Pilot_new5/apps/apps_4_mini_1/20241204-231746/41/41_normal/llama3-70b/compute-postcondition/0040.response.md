The value of `unrated` is assigned `False`, but it was already `False` in the initial state, so there is no change to this variable. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers, `unrated` is False, `rated` is False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop, `maybe` remains True, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.
