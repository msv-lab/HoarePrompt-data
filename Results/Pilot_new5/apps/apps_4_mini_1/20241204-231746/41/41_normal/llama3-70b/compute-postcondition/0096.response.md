Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. If `rated` is True, then `unrated` is False, `i` is `n`, `j` remains beyond the last index, and 'rated' has been printed. Otherwise, if `unrated` is True, the output is 'unrated'; if `unrated` is False and `rated` is False, the output is 'maybe'.***
