According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should increment by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 2 (which it already is, since \(n \geq 2\)).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
