According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `n` determines the number of iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Since the loop has already executed `n` times, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, since the loop has completed all its iterations, `_` is equal to `n - 1`. For the next iteration to be valid, the loop variable `_` must be less than `n`. Thus, the loop variable `_` should be adjusted to reflect that it has now completed `n` iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer obtained from user input, `b` is an integer obtained from user input, `ratings_before` has the value `ratings_before.append(a)`, `ratings_after` has the value `ratings_after.append(b)`**
