The code `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `ratings_before`. The previous values of the relevant variables are: `ratings_before` already indicates that `a` has been added to the list, and now `a` will simply be appended again. Other variables remain unaffected, and the condition regarding `n` stays the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains `a` added twice; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list; `_` is equal to `n`; `a` is the user input integer; `b` is the user input integer.**
