The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is guaranteed to be within the range 2 to 1000. Other variables are not affected, so the output state remains unchanged for them. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and `n` is an input integer.**
