Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; `unrated` is False; `rated` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `maybe` remains True; `j` is equal to `i + 2` and must be less than `n`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing as normal.***
