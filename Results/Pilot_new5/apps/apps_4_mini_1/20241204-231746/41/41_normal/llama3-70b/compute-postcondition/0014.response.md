The code appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The initial state indicates that `ratings_after` already contains the previous values plus `b`, so the new state will reflect that `ratings_after` now also includes `b` again. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains `a` added twice; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list, and now includes `b` again; `_` is equal to `n`; `a` is the user input integer; `b` is the user input integer.**
