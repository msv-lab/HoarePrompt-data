The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The output state retains the original values of the variables, along with the information about the break.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
