The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `j` is `i + 2`, where `n` must be greater than `i + 2; `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
