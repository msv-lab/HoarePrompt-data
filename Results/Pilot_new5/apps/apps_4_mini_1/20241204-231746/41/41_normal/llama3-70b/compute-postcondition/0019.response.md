According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 1000, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `n` meets these conditions. Before the loop starts, the `i` variable is not initialized, and it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the states should reflect that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, and all other variables are already defined as stated. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0**
