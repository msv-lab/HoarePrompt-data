The code snippet executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string 'rated'. This does not change any variable values or states. The values of `n`, `rated`, `unrated`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `rated` is True; `unrated` is False; `i` is `n`; `j` remains beyond the last index; and 'rated' has been printed.**
