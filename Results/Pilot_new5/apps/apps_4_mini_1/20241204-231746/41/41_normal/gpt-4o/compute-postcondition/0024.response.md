`is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are relevant to the current context. Since `is_unrated` is now set to `True`, it indicates that there is at least one rating that is not rated. The conditions concerning `n`, `ratings`, and `i` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, and `i` is 1. The current value of `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than the current value of `ratings[i][0]**.
