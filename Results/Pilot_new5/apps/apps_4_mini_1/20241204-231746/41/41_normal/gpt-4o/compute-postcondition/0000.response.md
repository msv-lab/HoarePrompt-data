The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition of `n` being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 still holds, but the specific value of `n` will now depend on user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and each of the next n lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126), with `n` now assigned a value based on user input.**
