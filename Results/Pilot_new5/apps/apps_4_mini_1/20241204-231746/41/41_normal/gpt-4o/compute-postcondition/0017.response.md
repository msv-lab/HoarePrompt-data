The code appends the tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The value of `ratings` is updated to include this new tuple. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` includes the tuples `(a, b)` and any previously stored tuples, and if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is set to True.**
