Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of the form (a, b), where `is_rated` is False. If at least one pair of consecutive ratings shows an increase, then `is_unrated` is True, `is_rated` remains False, and the output is 'unrated'. Otherwise, `is_unrated` is False, `is_rated` is False, and the output is 'maybe'.***
