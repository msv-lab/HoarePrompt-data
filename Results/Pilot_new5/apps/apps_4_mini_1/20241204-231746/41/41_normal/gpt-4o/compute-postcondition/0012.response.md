`ratings` is updated by appending the tuple `(a, b)` to it. The values of `a` and `b` remain inputs, and the tuple is added to the existing `ratings`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `_`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ratings` now includes an additional tuple `(a, b)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` with the new values of `a` and `b`.**
