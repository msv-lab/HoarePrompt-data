The code prints the string 'unrated'. There are no variable assignments or calculations affecting the variables in the state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of the form (a, b), where `is_rated` is False; at least one pair of consecutive ratings shows an increase, which makes `is_unrated` True; therefore, `is_rated` remains False; output is 'unrated'.**
