The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is True; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
