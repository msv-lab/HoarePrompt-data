`g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, and `g` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, `g` is 1**.
