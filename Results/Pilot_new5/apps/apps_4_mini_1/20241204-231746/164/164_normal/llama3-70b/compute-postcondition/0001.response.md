The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which captures a string input from the user. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial conditions regarding `n` and `k`, while indicating that `s` is now a string input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string**
