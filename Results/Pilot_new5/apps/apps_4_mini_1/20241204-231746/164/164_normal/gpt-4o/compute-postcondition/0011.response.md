Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, and `pos` is initialized to `G_pos`. If the character at the position `pos` in the string `line` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
