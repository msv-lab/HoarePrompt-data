Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True if `pos` is equal to `T_pos + k` and `pos` is set to both `G_pos` and `T_pos + k`. If `line[pos]` is equal to '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
