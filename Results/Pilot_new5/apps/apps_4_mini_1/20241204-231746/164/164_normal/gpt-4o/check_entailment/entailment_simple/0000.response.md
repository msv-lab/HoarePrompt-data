Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the grasshopper can reach the insect based on the problem description. Here's how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the integers `n` and `k`, and the string representing the line of cells. This aligns with the problem statement which specifies the format of the input.

2. **Position Identification**: The program finds the positions of 'G' (the grasshopper) and 'T' (the target insect) in the string. It ensures that `G_pos` is always less than or equal to `T_pos` by swapping their values if necessary. This step is crucial because it simplifies the subsequent logic by always moving from left to right.

3. **Jump Simulation**: The program then enters a loop that attempts to jump from the grasshopper's position to the target position using increments of `k`. During this iteration:
   - It checks if the current position is an obstacle ('#'). If it encounters an obstacle, the loop breaks, meaning the grasshopper cannot make further jumps to the right.
   - If the current position matches `T_pos`, it sets `reachable` to `True`, indicating the grasshopper can reach the insect.

4. **Output Decision**: Finally, based on the value of `reachable`, the program prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect and 'NO' otherwise.

The logic effectively covers all cases outlined in the problem description, including:
- The grasshopper jumping over obstacles.
- The grasshopper being unable to reach the insect if there is an obstacle in the direct jump path.
- The program correctly handles all valid configurations of the input string as guaranteed by the problem description.

Overall, the combination of position checking, jump simulation, and condition-based output confirms that the program operates correctly according to the given problem requirements.
