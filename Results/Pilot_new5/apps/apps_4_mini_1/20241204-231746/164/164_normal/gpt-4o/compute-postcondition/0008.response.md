According to the code, the loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. 

Since `G_pos` is already stated to be greater than `T_pos`, this condition is not met. Therefore, to enable the loop to execute, it is necessary for `G_pos` to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `T_pos`. 

Additionally, `pos` needs to be initialized to `G_pos`, as it will take on values in the specified range during the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, `pos` is initialized to `G_pos`**
