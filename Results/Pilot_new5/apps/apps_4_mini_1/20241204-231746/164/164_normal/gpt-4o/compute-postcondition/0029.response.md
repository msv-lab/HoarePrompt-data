Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, indicating that `pos` equals `T_pos` after the last iteration. If the loop completed without encountering '#', then `pos` equals `T_pos` and `reachable` is True; otherwise, if the loop did not execute, `pos` remains equal to `G_pos` and `reachable` is False.***
