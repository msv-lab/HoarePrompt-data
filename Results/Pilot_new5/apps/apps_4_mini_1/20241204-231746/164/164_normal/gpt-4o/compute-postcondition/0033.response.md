Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, and `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `reachable` is True, then `pos` equals `T_pos` after the last iteration, indicating the loop completed without encountering '#', and 'YES' has been printed. If the loop does not execute, `pos` remains equal to `G_pos`, and `reachable` is False. Conversely, if `reachable` is False, then `pos` is equal to `G_pos` if the loop does not execute, and if it does execute, `pos` will be the first index in `line` that contains '#' after `G_pos`, with the output being 'NO'.***
