The index of the character 'G' in the string `line` is assigned to `G_pos`. The variable `line` remains unaffected, but `G_pos` will now hold the position of the first occurrence of 'G' in that string. Since `line` is an input string, the exact value of `G_pos` will depend on the contents of `line`. The variables `n` and `k` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`.**
