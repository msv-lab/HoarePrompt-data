The code snippet sets the variable `reachable` to `False`. It does not impact any of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`). The values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `reachable` is False.**
