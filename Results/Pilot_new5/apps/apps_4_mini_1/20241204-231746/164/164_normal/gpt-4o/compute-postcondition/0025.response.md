The value of `reachable` is set to `True`. The conditions of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment. The state of the other variables stays the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is `G_pos + k`.**
