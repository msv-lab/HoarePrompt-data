Correctness: **False**.

The provided program fails to handle a specific case correctly. 

Consider the following input:

```
5 1
G..T.
```

In this case, the grasshopper (`G`) is at position 0 and the insect (`T`) is at position 4. The grasshopper can jump only to adjacent cells (k=1), so it can jump to positions 1, 2, and 3. However, it cannot reach position 4 because there are no obstacles in the way but the logic in the code incorrectly assumes that it can jump to position 4 since it doesn't check for the exact target position after jumping and checks only if it's an obstacle. 

Additionally, if `G` is at the end of the line and `T` is at the start with obstacles in between, the program would also not handle such cases correctly.

Therefore, as there are potential cases where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the correctness of the program is **False**.
