Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically regarding the handling of obstacles ('#') located between the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T'). 

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
5 2
G###T
```
In this case:
- The grasshopper 'G' is at index 0, and the insect 'T' is at index 4.
- The jump length `k` is 2, meaning the grasshopper can jump to index 2 directly, but index 2 has an obstacle '#', thus the grasshopper cannot reach 'T'.

In this situation, the output of the program would incorrectly print "YES" because the logic checks the modulo condition and finds that `abs(t - g) % k == 0`, which is true (4 % 2 == 0), but fails to account for the fact that the direct jump path is blocked by obstacles. The correct output should be "NO".

This demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
