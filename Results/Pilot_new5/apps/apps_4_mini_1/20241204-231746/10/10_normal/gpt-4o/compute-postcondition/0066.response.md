The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is contained. The program will proceed to the next iteration of that loop without executing any subsequent statements for the current iteration. Therefore, the values of `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `left_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the number of sofas below, `top_count[i]` is the number of sofas above, `d` is greater than 0 and greater than `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and `j` is 0, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
