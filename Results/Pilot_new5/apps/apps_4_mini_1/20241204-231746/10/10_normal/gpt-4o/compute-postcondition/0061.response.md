Output State: **`right_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `left_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the number of sofas below, and `top_count[i]` is the number of sofas above, all based on the positions of the sofas as given in `sofas`. The variable `d` is the total number of sofas, `i` is the index of the current sofa being analyzed, and `x1, y1, x2, y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `i`. If `d` is 0, the loop does not execute and all count variables remain at their initialized values (likely 0).**
