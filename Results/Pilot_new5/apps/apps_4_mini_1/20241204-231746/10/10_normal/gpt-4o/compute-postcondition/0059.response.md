The statement `top_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `top_count[i]` by 1. Since the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]`, `y1`, and `y2` remain unchanged from the precondition, the output state reflects these variables with an updated value for `top_count[i]`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
