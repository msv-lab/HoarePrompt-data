According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `d` is greater than 1, which implies that the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Additionally, `d` remains unchanged since the loop condition is based on it.

State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2.**
