Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `top_count[i]`.***
