The code `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and go to the next iteration. However, since we do not have any changes to the values of the variables based on this statement, the states of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
