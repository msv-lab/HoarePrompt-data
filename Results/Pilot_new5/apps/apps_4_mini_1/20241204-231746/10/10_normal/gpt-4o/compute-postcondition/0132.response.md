Postcondition: ***`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not satisfied, the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged if `i` is equal to `j`, or are updated to the values from `sofas[j]` if `i` is not equal to `j`.***
