Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i + 1`, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas below, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas above, `d` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x1` is equal to `sofas[i][0]`, `y1` is equal to `sofas[i][1]`, `x2` is equal to `sofas[i][2]`, `y2` is equal to `sofas[i][3]`, and if the current value of `i` is equal to `j`, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
