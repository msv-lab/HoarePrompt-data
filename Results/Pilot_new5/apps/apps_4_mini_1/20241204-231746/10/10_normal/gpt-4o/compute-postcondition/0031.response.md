Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is increased by 1, and `right_count[0]` is also increased by 1. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`.***
