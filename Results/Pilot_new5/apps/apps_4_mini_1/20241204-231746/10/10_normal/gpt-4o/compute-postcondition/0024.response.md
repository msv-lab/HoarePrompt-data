The code assigns the values from `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. However, it is stated that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop if `i` equals `j`, meaning that in this case, the assignment will not take place as the iteration is skipped. Therefore, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will not change, and the preconditions regarding `d`, `i`, and the values from `sofas[0]` remain valid. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, and the assignment to `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` does not occur because `i` equals `j`.**
