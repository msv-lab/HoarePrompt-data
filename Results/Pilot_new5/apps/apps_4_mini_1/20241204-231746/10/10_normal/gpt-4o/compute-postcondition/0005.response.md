The operation `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` adds a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the list `sofas`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the list `sofas` will now contain this new tuple. Since `sofas` was initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is the tuple of the four integer values.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned integer values from input.**
