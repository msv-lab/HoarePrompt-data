To determine the required states for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop. The loop iterates over the range defined by the integer `d`, which represents the number of sofas.

1. The loop will execute if `d` is greater than or equal to 0. However, for the loop to run at least once, `d` must be greater than 0.
2. At the start of the loop, the index variable `i` will need to be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the loop iteration.

Based on this analysis, the following adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute:

State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
