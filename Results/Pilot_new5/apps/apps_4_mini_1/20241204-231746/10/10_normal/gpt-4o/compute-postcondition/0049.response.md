According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `d`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `d` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 1. 

For the loop to execute again, the condition for `j` is that it must be less than `d`. Since `d` is greater than 1, `j` must be less than that value. Thus, after increasing `j` by 1, `j` will be 1, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
