Output State: **`right_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the right of sofa `i`, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas below, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas above, `d` is the total number of sofas, `j` is the index of the last sofa checked (which will be `d-1` after all iterations), `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, and the loop will execute `d-1` times if `d` is greater than `0`. If `d` is `0`, then `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
