The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are now assigned from `sofas[i]`. This means that `x1` takes the value of the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` takes the value of the second element, `x2` takes the value of the third element, and `y2` takes the value of the fourth element from the same index. The states of `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, `top_count`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i + 1`, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas below, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas above, `d` remains greater than `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `sofas[i][0]`, `y1` is equal to `sofas[i][1]`, `x2` is equal to `sofas[i][2]`, `y2` is equal to `sofas[i][3]`.**
