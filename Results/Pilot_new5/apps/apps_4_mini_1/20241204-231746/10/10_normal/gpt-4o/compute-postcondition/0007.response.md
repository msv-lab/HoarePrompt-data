The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` using the `map` function, which converts the input values into integers. The variables `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will be updated based on the input provided.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers from input.**
