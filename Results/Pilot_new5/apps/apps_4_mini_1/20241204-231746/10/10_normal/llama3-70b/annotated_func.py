#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas, where each sofa is defined by four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2); d is an integer representing the number of sofas, and n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse; cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, and cnt_b are non-negative integers representing the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa respectively, such that 0 <= cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b <= d - 1.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of `d` sofas, where `d` is greater than or equal to 0. `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` represent the counts of sofas positioned relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there are no other sofas, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 0. If there are other sofas, their counts will depend on their coordinates relative to `sofa[0]` based on the conditions described in the loop.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the counts of sofas positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa, based on their coordinates in the 2D list 'sofa'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `sofa` representing the coordinates of a specific sofa, and a list `sofas` representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. It counts and returns the number of sofas located to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa based on their coordinates. It does not handle cases where the sofa coordinates may be invalid or overlapping, and there are no checks for the validity of the input data.
