Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 3 sofas. If `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1 while `top` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the state of `bottom` and `top` remains unchanged.***
