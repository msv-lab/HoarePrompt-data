The function accepts a 2D list `sofa` representing the coordinates of a specific sofa, and a list `sofas` representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. It counts and returns the number of sofas located to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa based on their coordinates. It does not handle cases where the sofa coordinates may be invalid or overlapping, and there are no checks for the validity of the input data.
