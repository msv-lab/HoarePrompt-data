To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze both the implementation and the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Breakdown of the Requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: 
   - The program reads an integer `d` (number of sofas).
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the storehouse.
   - It then reads `d` lines of sofa coordinates, each specified by four integers `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
   - Finally, it reads four integers `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` which represent the counts of sofas located on the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa respectively.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The output should be the index (1-based) of the sofa that matches the given conditions. If no such sofa exists, return `-1`.

3. **Sofa Positioning**: 
   - The program must correctly determine how many sofas are positioned in relation to a specific sofa in four directions (left, right, top, and bottom) based on their coordinates.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program properly reads the input values as per the assumed structure.

2. **Sofa Representation**: 
   - Each sofa is stored as a tuple of coordinates, which is correct.

3. **Counting Logic** (`func_1`):
   - The function correctly checks the relative positions of other sofas with respect to the given sofa.
   - It uses coordinate comparisons to increment counters for sofas that are positioned to the left, right, top, or bottom.
   - The conditionals effectively filter out the sofa being compared to itself, which is necessary since we only want to count other sofas.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After counting the relative positions, the program checks if any sofa matches the required counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) and prints the corresponding index if found.
   - If no matching sofa is found after checking all, it correctly returns `-1`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Coordinate Comparison Logic**: The logic for determining the position of sofas is based solely on the first coordinate of the sofas. This could lead to issues:
  - If two sofas are aligned vertically, the existing logic would not correctly count sofas positioned relative to the second coordinate.
  - Specifically, the program only checks whether the y-coordinates are equal while comparing x-coordinates for left/right and vice versa for top/bottom. It needs to consider both coordinates more comprehensively, as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program does not account for all possible configurations of sofas correctly due to the limitations in its coordinate comparison logic, it can produce incorrect results. 

For example, if a sofa is positioned directly above another, the current logic may not count it if they share the same x-coordinate but differ in y-coordinate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program fails based on the provided requirements.

Correctness: **False**
