Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key reasons why it fails to meet the description:

1. **Coordinate Check Logic**: The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of sofas relative to a given sofa based on their positions. However, the logic implemented checks only the coordinates of the first cell of the sofa (`sofa[0][0]`, `sofa[0][1]`). The expectation is that the program should consider the entire area covered by the sofa, which consists of two neighboring cells. The program incorrectly assumes that it can determine the positioning of sofas using only one of the sofa's coordinates.

2. **Incorrect Sofa Positioning Counting**: The conditions under which sofas are counted to the left, right, top, or bottom are based solely on comparing their coordinates. However, the problem states that a sofa occupies two cells and that the two cells must be considered when determining relationships between the sofas. The current implementation does not account for this and may lead to incorrect counts.

3. **Lack of Boundary Verification**: The program does not ensure that the sofas do not overlap or that they are positioned correctly according to the conditions outlined in the problem. It simply counts based on the provided coordinates without validating if those coordinates truly represent separate sofas as per the problem's definition.

4. **Output Handling**: The program is structured to output the index of the first sofa that matches the count criteria. While this part seems correct, the preceding logic to derive the counts is flawed, and thus the output will also be incorrect.

In summary, due to the improper handling of the coordinate checks and the lack of comprehensive consideration of the sofas' positions, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
