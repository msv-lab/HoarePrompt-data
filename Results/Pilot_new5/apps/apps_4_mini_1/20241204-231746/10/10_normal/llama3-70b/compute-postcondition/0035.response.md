Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of at least 3 sofas. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` with `sofa[0][0]` equal to `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1 while `top` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the values of `bottom` and `top` remain unchanged.***
