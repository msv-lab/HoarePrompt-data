The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `2 * n` after this operation. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation, so we only update `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 2 but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
