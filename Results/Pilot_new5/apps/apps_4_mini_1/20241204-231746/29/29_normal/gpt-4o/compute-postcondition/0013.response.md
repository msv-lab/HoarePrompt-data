Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples. If `type_` equals '1', then `examples` includes `name`, and `regulars` may contain the value of `name` or remain an empty list depending on `type_`. Otherwise, `examples` will be updated accordingly, and `regulars` now includes `name`.***
