The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`. After the increment, `temp_counter` will still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, assuming the initial value was within that range. The value of `n` remains unchanged as well as any other variable states. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1 and `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1.**
