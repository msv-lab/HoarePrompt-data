The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\). The parameter `files` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string composed of digits and small English letters with a length ranging from 1 to 6) and a type (a string that is either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test). After executing the function body, it returns a list of all move operations performed, indicating that all regular tests have been updated to their final target positions and no additional moves are necessary. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, and returns a list of move operations indicating that all regular tests have been updated to their final positions.**
