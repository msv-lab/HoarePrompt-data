The `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, where `temp_counter` was originally greater than `2 * n + 1`. After this, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, which means it will now be greater than `2 * n + 2`. The `moves` list is updated to include the formatted string `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`, where `examples[i]` is the string representation of the updated `temp_counter`. Therefore, the new value of `examples[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`. The `moves` will contain a new entry corresponding to this move.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 2`, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` is updated with `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`.**
