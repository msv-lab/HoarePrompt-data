To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute, we analyze the loop condition: 

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are satisfied:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Looking at the current state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, which means `temp_counter` is definitely greater than `2 * n`, so the first condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` cannot be satisfied.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to ensure it is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This could be done, for example, by setting `temp_counter` to a value that is at most `2 * n`.

The second condition regarding `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set` does not need adjustment because it is already established that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. 

Thus, the adjustment required is to change `temp_counter` such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
