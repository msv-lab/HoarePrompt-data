The line of code `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a new string to the `moves` list. The variable `i` is used to index into the `examples` list, and `temp_counter` retains its value, which is greater than `2 * n`. Since `examples` contains at least one filename of type '1', `examples[i]` will refer to a valid filename in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`**.
