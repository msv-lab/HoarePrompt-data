`regulars[i]` is assigned the value `str(temp_counter)`. The previous state indicates that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, which means `str(temp_counter)` is a string representation of a value greater than `2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`.**
