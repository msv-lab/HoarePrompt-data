To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

Here, the loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are satisfied:
1. `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set`.

Now, let's evaluate the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), which means `2 * n` will always be at least 2 and at most 200000.
- `temp_counter` is defined as the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that is not present in `files_set`, plus 1. Therefore, `temp_counter` is guaranteed to be greater than `2 * n`, making the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) false.

Since the first condition is not satisfied, the loop cannot execute even once. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least one time, we need to adjust `temp_counter` such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This adjustment can be made by ensuring `temp_counter` is set to a value within the range of 1 to `2 * n` (inclusive).

Thus, the necessary adjustment is:

- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

No other state adjustments are necessary since `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves` do not affect the conditions of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
