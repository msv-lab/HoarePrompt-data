Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 1 tuple. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` contains `name` and `regulars` is an empty list. Otherwise, `regulars` contains the value of `name`, while `examples` remains an empty list, and `type_` is not equal to '1'.***
