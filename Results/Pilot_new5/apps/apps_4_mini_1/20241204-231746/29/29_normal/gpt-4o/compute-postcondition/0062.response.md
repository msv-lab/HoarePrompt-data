`examples[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`. The variable `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `n` remains a positive integer. The state of the other variables, including `files_set` and `moves`, is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`**.
