The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, so after incrementing by 1, the condition still holds as long as `temp_counter` was within the specified range. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 (temp_counter + 1) and must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set.**
