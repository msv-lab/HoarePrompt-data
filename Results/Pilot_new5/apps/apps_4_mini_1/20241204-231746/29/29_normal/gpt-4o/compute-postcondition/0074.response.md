To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Checking `temp_counter <= 2 * n`:** 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is adjusted to a value less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Since `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` (i.e., `temp_counter + 1` must be ≤ `2 * n`).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`.

2. **Checking `str(temp_counter) in files_set`:**
   - For the next iteration, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must also be present in `files_set`. This means that we need to adjust the state so that the incremented value of `temp_counter` will still produce a string that is in the `files_set`.

Given this analysis, the adjustments to the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be present in `files_set`, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1**
