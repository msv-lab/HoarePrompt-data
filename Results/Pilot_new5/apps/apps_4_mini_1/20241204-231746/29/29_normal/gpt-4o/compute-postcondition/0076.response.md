According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will continue executing as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` should be incremented to `2 * n`, making it necessary to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is present in `files_set`. 

Since `temp_counter` is currently at most `2 * n - 1`, we need to adjust it to ensure that the next value (`temp_counter + 1`) is included in `files_set`. Therefore, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Additionally, `target` being equal to `len(examples) + 1` does not need adjustment as it does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` is now less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be present in `files_set.**
