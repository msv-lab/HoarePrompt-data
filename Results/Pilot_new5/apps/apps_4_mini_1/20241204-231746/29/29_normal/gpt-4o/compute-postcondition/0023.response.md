Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1` (i.e., `examples[0]` is not equal to '1').***
