According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop will execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. 

Currently, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that was not present in `files_set`, which means `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to execute. Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, I must adjust `temp_counter` to a value that is both less than or equal to `2 * n` and present in `files_set`. The current `regulars[i]` being not equal to `str(target)` does not affect the condition for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`**.
