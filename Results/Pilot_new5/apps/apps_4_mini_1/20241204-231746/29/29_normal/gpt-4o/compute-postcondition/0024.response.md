According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will execute if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

Right before the loop, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`, which is always greater than `2 * n` when `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is not satisfied. 

To allow the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This can be accomplished by adjusting `temp_counter` to be equal to or less than `2 * n`. One possible adjustment is to set `temp_counter` to `2 * n` or any value less than it. 

Additionally, it is essential to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set` for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `temp_counter` and ensure that `files_set` includes the appropriate string representation of `temp_counter`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` must be set to 2 * n or less, and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**.
