`examples[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, the value of `str(temp_counter)` is a string representation of that number. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now contains at least 1 name of files of type '1' with `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now includes `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
