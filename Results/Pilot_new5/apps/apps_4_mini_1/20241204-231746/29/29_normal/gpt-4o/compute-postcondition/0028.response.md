According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions related to the variable `temp_counter` and the presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`. The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 (so its current value is `temp_counter + 1`).
- `temp_counter + 1` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, which means `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 2`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time:
1. `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n` after the increment, meaning it needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` (which it already is).
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is incremented to `temp_counter + 1`, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is present in `files_set`.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 (temp_counter + 1) and must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and str(temp_counter + 1) must be in files_set**
