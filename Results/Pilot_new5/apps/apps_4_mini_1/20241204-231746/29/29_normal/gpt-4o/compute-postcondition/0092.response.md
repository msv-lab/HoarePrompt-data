To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop based on the variables involved.

The loop conditions are:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value by 2 but still less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute again:
- `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, this condition may hold true for the next iteration.
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`. 

Given that `temp_counter` has increased by at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must remain within the bounds of `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must still be a valid entry in `files_set`.

As `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, it doesn't necessarily need to be adjusted; however, we must ensure it doesn't exceed `2 * n` in the next iteration. Since the condition `str(temp_counter) must be in files_set` is critical, we need to ensure that the new value of `temp_counter` still satisfies this condition.

Thus, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and str(temp_counter) must remain in `files_set`**
