According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will run `n` times, and if it has executed once, that means we are currently on the first iteration (0-indexed) and the loop will execute for the second time if `n` is at least 2. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), we can assume that if it executed once, `n` must be at least 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still a positive integer, and since we are using a range that starts from 0, after the last execution `_` would be 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `_` would increase to 1, meaning the loop will execute a second time as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing the previous elements and the new tuple (name, int(type_)), and for the loop to execute one more time, n must be greater than 1.**
