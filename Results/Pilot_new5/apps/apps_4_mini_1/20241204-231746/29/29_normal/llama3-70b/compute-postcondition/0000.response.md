The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will now hold the input integer value, which is still within the specified range. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `n` is now an input integer.**
