The `files` list is sorted based on the second element of each tuple (which is `int(type_)`), in descending order. The initial state indicates that `files` contains `n` tuples. The values of `n` and the individual tuples within `files` are not explicitly provided, but we know that the tuples will be rearranged in the list based on the sorting criteria.

Since the original tuples in `files` remain the same in content but are reordered based on their second elements, the output state will reflect the new order of the `files` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order.**
