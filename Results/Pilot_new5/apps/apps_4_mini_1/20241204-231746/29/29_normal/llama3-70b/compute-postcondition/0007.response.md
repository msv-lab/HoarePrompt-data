The code appends a tuple containing the input string `name` and the integer `type_` to the list `files`. The variable `files` is updated to include this new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer, and it does not change as a result of this operation. The output state reflects the addition of the new tuple to the `files` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing the previous elements and the new tuple (name, int(type_))**
