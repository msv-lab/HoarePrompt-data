Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential edge cases as specified in the problem description. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
1 0
2 1
3 1
```

Here, we have three files where:
- `1` is a regular test
- `2` and `3` are example tests

According to the problem requirements, the output should be:
```
3
move 2 1
move 3 2
move 1 3
```

However, analyzing the function `func_1`, when it processes the example tests, it might not correctly assign the names to the files, especially when the temporary filenames (`temp_counter`) are higher than the number of files. This could lead to the program either overwriting files incorrectly or not generating the correct moves when handling the renaming.

Additionally, the logic for handling cases where all or none of the files are examples is particularly flawed, as it does not ensure that the correct naming scheme ("1", "2", ..., "e", "e+1", ..., "n") is adhered to in a consistent manner.

Thus, since there are potential input cases where the program fails to produce the correct output, it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
