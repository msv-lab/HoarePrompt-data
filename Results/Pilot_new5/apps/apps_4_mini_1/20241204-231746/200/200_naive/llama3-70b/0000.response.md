To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the function.

The main steps in the function are:

1. It reads the number of kegs (`n`) and the amount of kvass to pour (`s`).
2. It reads the volumes of kvass in each keg and sorts them.
3. It initializes a binary search to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters.
4. It sums up the kvass that can be poured given the current guessed amount (`mid`) for the least filled keg, and adjusts the search bounds based on whether the total poured is less than or greater than `s`.
5. After the binary search, it checks if the total kvass poured is equal to `s` and prints the appropriate result.

However, there is a problem with the condition in the binary search loop. Specifically, the update of `low` and `high` is incorrect. The condition `if total < s:` should actually move `low` to `mid + 1` to explore larger values of `mid`, since we are looking for the maximum volume that can be left in the least keg. 

Here is a potential test case where the program fails:
- Input:
```
3 3
4 3 5
```
The expected output is `3`, which the program gives correctly. However, if we try:
- Input:
```
3 7
1 2 3
```
The expected output is `-1`, and the program should correctly identify that it cannot pour that amount. 

However, consider the input:
- Input:
```
3 4
5 6 7
```
The expected output should be `4`, but due to the faulty binary search logic, the program may not return the correct value.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the binary search for finding the maximum kvass level left in the least keg is flawed. Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
