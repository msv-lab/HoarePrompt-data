Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, and `remaining_kvass` is unchanged. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration with `i` incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. Otherwise, `i` is also incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `possible_to_take` is set to 0.***
