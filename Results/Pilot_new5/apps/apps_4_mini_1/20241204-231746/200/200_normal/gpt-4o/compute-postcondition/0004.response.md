Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`, and the current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`.***
