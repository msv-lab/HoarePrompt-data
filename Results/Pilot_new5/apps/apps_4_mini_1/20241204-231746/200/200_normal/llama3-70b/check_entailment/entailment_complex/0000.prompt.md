You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), s is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and v is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the volume of kvass in each keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which implies that the loop has terminated when `low` reached the final value that satisfies the condition. The final value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, it indicates that the original minimum value of `v` was insufficient to reach `s`, and if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, it indicates that the loop terminated with `low` being the maximum value that meets the condition. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `mid` is the average of the final `low` and `high` values in the last iteration. `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, and `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is not equal to `s`, the output is -1 and `mid` is the average of the final values of `low` and `high`. If `total` is equal to `s`, the value of `low` is printed, indicating that the original minimum value of `v` was sufficient to reach `s`. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the target volume), along with a list `v` of `n` positive integers representing the kvass volume in each keg. It determines the maximum volume `low` that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs to achieve the total volume `s`. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns -1; otherwise, it outputs the value of `low`. The function also handles cases where the total kvass volume is less than `s` by ensuring that the output is -1 if the conditions are not met.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
