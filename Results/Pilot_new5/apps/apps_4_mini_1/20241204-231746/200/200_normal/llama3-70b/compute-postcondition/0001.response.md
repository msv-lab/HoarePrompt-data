The variable `v` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split into components. The input consists of `n` positive integers. Therefore, after executing the code, `v` will be a list containing these `n` integers. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, while `v` is updated to reflect the input.

Output State: **`v` is a list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer; `v` is updated to the list of integers from input.**
