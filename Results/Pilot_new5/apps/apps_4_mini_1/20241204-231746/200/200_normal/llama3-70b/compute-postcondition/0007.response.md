Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value of `v`, `mid` is equal to `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. The current value of `total` is less than `s`.***
