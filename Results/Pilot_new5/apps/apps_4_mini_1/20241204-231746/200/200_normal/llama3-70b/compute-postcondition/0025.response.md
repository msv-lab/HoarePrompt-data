Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, which indicates that the loop has terminated with `low` reaching the final value that satisfies the condition. The final value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer. The current value of `total` is not equal to `s`, which indicates that the original minimum value of `v` was insufficient to reach `s`. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `mid` is the average of these final values.***
