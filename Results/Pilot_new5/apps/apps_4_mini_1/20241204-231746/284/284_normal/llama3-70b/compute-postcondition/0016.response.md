Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range 1 to 1000 and returns False if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `num`. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by any of those integers, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.**
