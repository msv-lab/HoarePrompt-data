The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The previous value of `i` was 5, so the new value of `i` becomes 11. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 25 and is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, `i` is now 11, and `x` is not divisible by 5 or 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 25 and is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, `i` is 11, and `x` is not divisible by 5 or 7.**
