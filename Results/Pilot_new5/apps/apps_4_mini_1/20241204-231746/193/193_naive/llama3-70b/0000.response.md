Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. The program simply computes the absolute difference `abs(x - y)`, which does not account for the constraints of maintaining the triangle's non-degenerate property throughout the modification process.

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The expected output, as per the problem description, is `4`, representing the series of valid modifications needed to achieve the desired triangle. However, the program would output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect.

Another example is `8 5`, where the expected output is `3`, while the program would again incorrectly compute `abs(8 - 5) = 3`, which is correct in this case, but not due to the logic of the programâ€”rather, by coincidence.

Overall, the program fails to cover cases where the adjustments must consider maintaining the triangle's properties, leading to incorrect results.
