To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) and wants to reduce it to an equilateral triangle of side length \( y \). The operations allowed are:
1. Modifying the length of a single side while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning the lengths must always be positive integers).
2. Each side can be decreased individually.

The goal is to calculate the minimum number of seconds (or operations) required to achieve this.

### Program Logic
The given program implements the following logic:
```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

Here, the program computes the number of operations needed by doing the following:
1. It calculates the difference \( (x - y) \).
2. The expression `(x - y) // 2` represents how many pairs of sides can be reduced simultaneously (which effectively reduces the total length by 2).
3. The expression `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining single side reduction needed if the difference is odd.

### Edge Cases
Let's analyze if the program covers all scenarios.

1. **Valid Input Range**: The problem states that \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). Thus the input will always be valid integers within specified limits.
2. **Reduction to Non-Degenerate Triangle**: For the triangle to remain non-degenerate, at no point should any of the sides be less than or equal to zero. Since we are reducing from \( x \) down to \( y \) where \( y \) is always less than \( x \), the program seems to correctly consider the non-degenerate condition.

### Example Analysis
- For `6 3`, the difference is `3`. The program calculates: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` which is incorrect (it should return 4).
- For `8 5`, the difference is `3`. The program calculates: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` which is incorrect (it should return 3).
- For `22 4`, the difference is `18`. The program calculates: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9` which is incorrect (it should return 6).

### Conclusion
The calculations performed by the program do not yield the correct minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length \( x \) to \( y \). 

Some specific cases where it fails:
- For `6 3`, the expected output is `4`, but it returns `2`.
- For `8 5`, the expected output is `3`, but it returns `2`.
- For `22 4`, the expected output is `6`, but it returns `9`.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
