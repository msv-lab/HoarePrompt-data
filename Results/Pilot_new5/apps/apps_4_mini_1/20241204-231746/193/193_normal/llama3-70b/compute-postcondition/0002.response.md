The function `func` does not take any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that there are two integers, `x` and `y`, such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. Based on these constraints, the output of the function is not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine specific return values or behavior from the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is dependent on the values of `x` and `y`, but since they are not given as parameters to the function, it is unclear what the function returns or how it behaves.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that there are two integers x and y such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific output or behavior is not defined.**
