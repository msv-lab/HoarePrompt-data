The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided by the user through `map(int, input().split())`. Since `x` and `y` are initially defined as integers that satisfy the conditions 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, their new values will depend on the input received. The conditions for `x` and `y` will still hold after the assignment, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will change to whatever integers are inputted.

Output State: **3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, where `x` and `y` are the integers provided as input.**
