To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we must analyze the logic of the program and see if it handles all potential cases appropriately.

The program reads two binary strings representing numbers in the "golden system" and then compares their decimal values based on the formula given, which involves calculations with the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function `func_1` computes the decimal value of a given string based on the presence of '1's, raising \( q \) to the appropriate power for each '1' in the string.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input correctly, ensuring that the input strings are non-empty and consist of only '0's and '1's, as per the problem description.

2. **Calculation Method**: The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value according to the defined formula. It correctly iterates over the string and calculates the value only where '1's are present. The exponent is calculated correctly as \( n - i - 1 \), which aligns with the description.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the values for both inputs, the program compares them and prints the correct symbols ('>', '<', '=') based on the comparison.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- **Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros, but since it computes values only based on the presence of '1's, leading zeros do not affect the results. For instance, '00100' and '11' will both compute to the same value.
- **All Zeros**: The problem description states that the input will be non-empty and consist only of '0's and '1's. Hence, a string of all zeros is not a valid input according to the problem constraints.

Considering all of the above points, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description and handles inputs as specified.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
