#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings; `q` is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2; `decimal` is the weighted sum of the characters in the concatenated strings of `s`, computed as \(\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} int(c_j) * q^j\); `i` is \(N-1\).
    return decimal
    #The program returns the weighted sum of the characters in the concatenated strings of tuple 's', computed as \(\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} int(c_j) * q^j\), where 'q' is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2 and 'i' is N-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters. It concatenates these strings and computes the weighted sum of the characters using the golden ratio, returning this decimal value. There are no checks for the contents of the strings beyond ensuring they are non-empty. If `s` contains invalid characters (other than '0' or '1'), this could lead to a ValueError when converting to integers, but such cases are not addressed in the code.
