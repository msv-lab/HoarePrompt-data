The variable `decimal` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `s` and `q`, remain unaffected as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000; `q` is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2; `decimal` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000; `q` is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2; `decimal` is 0.**
