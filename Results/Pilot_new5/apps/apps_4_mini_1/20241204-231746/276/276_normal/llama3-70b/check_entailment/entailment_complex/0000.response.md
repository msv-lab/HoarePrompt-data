Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the implementation of the function `func_1`. 

### Issues:
1. **Input Handling in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is defined to take a single argument `s`, which is intended to be a tuple containing two strings. However, the code calls `func_1(a)` and `func_1(b)` where `a` and `b` are single strings, not a tuple. This leads to a misunderstanding of how the function is supposed to operate.

2. **Concatenation of Strings:** The explanation of the function states that it concatenates the strings in the tuple `s`, but since the input to the function is just a single string each time (not a tuple), this concatenation does not occur. The program does not account for both strings `a` and `b` at the same time, making it impossible to evaluate the two numbers against each other as required by the problem description.

3. **Calculation of Weights:** The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value based on the incoming string alone, but does not handle the comparison of two separate golden system representations properly due to the way it is structured.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect function signature and the inappropriate handling of input for comparing two strings, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately. Therefore, it fails to correctly determine which of the two golden system numbers is larger, smaller, or if they are equal.

If the function were to correctly accept strings from both inputs and perform the necessary calculations to compare them directly after evaluating both values, it would then adhere to the problem requirements. As it stands, the program does not do this, hence the result of the correctness check is **False**.
