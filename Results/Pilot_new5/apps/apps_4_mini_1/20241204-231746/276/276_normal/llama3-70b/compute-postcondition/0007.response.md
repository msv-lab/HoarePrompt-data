The variable `i` is raised to the power of 2 (since `i` is 2), and the value of `q` is \((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2\). Therefore, the expression `q ** i` becomes \((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2\) squared. The variable `decimal` is updated by adding the product of `int(c)` and this squared value of `q`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings; `q` is \((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2\); `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * ((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2) ** 2`; `i` is 2**
