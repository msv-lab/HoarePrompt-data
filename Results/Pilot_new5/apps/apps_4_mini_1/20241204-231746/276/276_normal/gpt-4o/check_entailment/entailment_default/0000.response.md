The provided Python program aims to compare two numbers represented in a unique "golden system" based on the properties of the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The program calculates the decimal value of the strings representing these numbers and then compares them.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1(s)` computes the decimal value of the input string `s` by iterating over its characters. For each character that is '1', it calculates \( q^{(n - i - 1)} \) where `n` is the length of the string, and `i` is the current index. This is done correctly based on the description of how the golden system converts strings to decimal values.

2. The main part of the program reads two strings, computes their decimal values using `func_1`, and compares the results, printing '>', '<', or '=' accordingly.

### Edge Case Analysis
However, there are potential edge cases that need to be considered:
- The program does not seem to handle cases where both strings consist of only '0's accurately. In such cases, both should yield a decimal value of 0, leading to an output of '='. However, the input constraints specify that the strings will be non-empty, so it's guaranteed that there will be at least one '1' in each input string.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints indicate that the function computes values based on the Fibonacci constant \( q \) raised to the appropriate powers for each '1' found in the string. The hints also correctly mention that the function returns 0 if there are no '1's in the string. However, since the input constraints ensure non-empty strings, this is not a concern for our inputs.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis:
- The program correctly implements the conversion from the golden system to decimal values and handles comparisons as specified in the problem description.
- The output hints agree with the function's behavior based on the provided code, and the edge cases that were identified do not apply due to the constraints.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the program is functioning correctly for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
