The variable `curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous value of `curr_sum`, which was equal to `target_sum`, is now updated to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first character of the ticket string.
