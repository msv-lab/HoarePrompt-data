The variable `target_sum` is assigned the value of `total_sum // 2`, where `total_sum` is a non-negative integer and is also given to be an even number. Therefore, `target_sum` will also be an integer since it is a result of integer division. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), where each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`.**
