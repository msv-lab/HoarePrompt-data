The variable `curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `curr_sum` is either an accumulated sum or some initial value, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables, such as `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments`, remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is unchanged, and `segments` is increased by 1.**
