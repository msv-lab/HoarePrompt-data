Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. It assumes that both indices are valid and within the bounds of the string's length, which must be between 2 and 100. There are no checks for invalid index ranges, so if `start` is greater than `end` or if either index is out of bounds, the function may raise an IndexError. **
