The value of `current_sum` is incremented by `int(ticket[i])`, which means it will take the integer value of the first character of the string `ticket` (since `i` is 0). The `ticket` variable consists of `n` digits, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, `ticket[i]` will definitely be a valid digit. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of n digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
