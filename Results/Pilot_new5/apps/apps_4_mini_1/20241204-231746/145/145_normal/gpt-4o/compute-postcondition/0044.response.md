Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is the number of segments in `ticket` whose sum equals `target_sum`. If the loop executes at least once, `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration. If there are no segments found that equal `target_sum`, then `segment_count` will remain 0.**
