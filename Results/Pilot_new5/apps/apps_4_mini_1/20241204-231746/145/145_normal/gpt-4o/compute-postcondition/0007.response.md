The value of `current_sum` is explicitly set to 0, which changes its previous value (equal to `target_sum`, which is the first digit of `ticket`). The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.**
