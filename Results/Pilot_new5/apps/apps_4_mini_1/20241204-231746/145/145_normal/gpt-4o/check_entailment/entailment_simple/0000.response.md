To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly identifies whether the given sequence of digits (the ticket) can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of digits in the ticket, and subsequently reads the `ticket` itself as a string of digits.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each segment length, it computes a `target_sum` using a helper function `segment_sum`, which calculates the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of the ticket.
   - It then traverses the digits of the ticket, accumulating a `current_sum`. Whenever `current_sum` matches `target_sum`, it resets `current_sum` and increments a `segment_count`.
   - After checking all digits, it determines if it found at least two segments with sums equal to `target_sum` (checking if `current_sum` is zero and if `segment_count` is greater than 1).

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If a valid partitioning is found, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Potential Issues:
- The function relies on the assumption that segments can be formed continuously from the beginning to the end of the ticket. It checks for matches against the `target_sum` but does not account for the possibility that there could be different valid segmentations beyond just comparing to the initial `target_sum`.
- The segment sums may inadvertently skip possible valid segmentations or might not check all potential segment combinations effectively.

### Example Evaluation:
For the input ticket `73452`:
- The program attempts to segment this ticket based on various starting segment lengths.
- It correctly identifies that the ticket can indeed be divided into segments with equal sums.

For the input ticket `1248`:
- The program properly determines that there are no valid segmentations that meet the criteria, thus returning 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The reasoning presented indicates that the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement for all given examples. It effectively checks for valid segments and determines if the ticket is "lucky".
