The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `ticket` is a string composed of `n` digits, where each digit is a character representing an integer between '0' and '9'. 

After executing the function body, the function can return the following based on different conditions: 

- If segment_count is greater than 1, the function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for segments matching the target sum have been met (Case_1).
- If the conditions involving `n`, `ticket`, `current_sum`, and `segment_count` are satisfied, the function returns 'YES' (Case_2).
- If there are multiple segments where the sum of the digits equals the target sum, and the current sum of digits is 0, the function returns 'YES' (Case_3).
- If `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 'NO' (Case_4).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a string `ticket` (of `n` digits) and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions regarding the summation of segments represented by the digits in `ticket`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a string ticket (of n digits), returning 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions regarding the summation of segments represented by the digits in ticket.**
