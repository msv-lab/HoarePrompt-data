The value of `new_marks` is updated by adding `mark - y` to it. The other variables retain their values as described in the initial state. The conditions involving `marks_set` are not directly impacted by this operation, and `new_marks` now includes the specific value `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` has `mark - y` included.**
