The code `print(len(result))` will output the length of the list `result`. The initial state indicates that `result` contains the variable `x`. Since `y_found` is False, `y` has been appended to `result`, making `result` contain both `x` and `y`.

Thus, `result` has two items: `x` and `y`. The length of `result` is therefore `2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `new_marks` is an empty set, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and the length of `result` is 2.**
