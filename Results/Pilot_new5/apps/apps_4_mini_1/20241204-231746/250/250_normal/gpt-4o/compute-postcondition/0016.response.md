The value of `x_found` is explicitly set to `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is True, and `y_found` is True**
