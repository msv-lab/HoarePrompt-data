The value of `new_marks` will include `mark + y` as a result of the code executed. The states of the other variables are not affected by this specific operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` now includes `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` includes `mark + y`**
