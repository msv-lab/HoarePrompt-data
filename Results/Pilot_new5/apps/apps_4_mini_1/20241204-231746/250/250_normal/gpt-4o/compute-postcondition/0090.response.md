Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with `n` elements. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the output `0` has been printed. Otherwise, if `new_marks` is not empty, then `new_marks` is a set with one less element and output `1` was printed. If `new_marks` is empty, `result` is a list containing `x` and `y` of length 2, and the output is ' '.join(map(str, result)).***
