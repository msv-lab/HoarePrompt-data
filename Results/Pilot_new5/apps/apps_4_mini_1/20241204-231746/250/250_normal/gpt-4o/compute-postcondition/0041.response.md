Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and none of the following are true: `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
