Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and it is currently true that `y_found` is not true. The conditions `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` are not in `marks_set`. It is true that either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will include `mark - x`; otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
