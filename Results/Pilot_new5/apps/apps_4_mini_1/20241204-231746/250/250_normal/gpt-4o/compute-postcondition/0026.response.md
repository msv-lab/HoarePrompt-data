Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `mark` is the third element in `marks`. If either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`, then both `x_found` and `y_found` are True. If neither condition is met, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
