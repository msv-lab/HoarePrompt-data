n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; l is a positive integer representing the length of the ruler such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; x and y are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; and a is a list of n integers representing the distances of marks from the origin, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l.
