Since `new_marks` is a set, the `pop()` method will remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. The specific element that is removed cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `new_marks`. However, the set will now be one element smaller.

The other variables remain unchanged as there are no modifications to `n`, `x_found`, or `y_found`. The printed output indicates that an element was successfully popped from `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `new_marks` is a set with one less element, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, output `1` was printed.**
