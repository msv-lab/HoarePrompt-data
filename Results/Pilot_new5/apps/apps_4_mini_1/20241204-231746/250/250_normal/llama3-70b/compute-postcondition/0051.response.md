Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, `need_y` remains unchanged, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`. If the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` holds true, then the state remains unchanged as described in the precondition.***
