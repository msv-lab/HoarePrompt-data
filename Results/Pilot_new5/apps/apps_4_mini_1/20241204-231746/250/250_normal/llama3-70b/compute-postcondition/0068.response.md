To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to look at the provided state and the for loop structure. The variable `marks` needs to contain elements for the loop to iterate over.

1. The loop iterates over `marks`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to ensure that `marks` is either an iterable collection (like a list) with elements or define a default state for it.
  
2. The state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000. While this information is relevant, it doesn't directly influence the execution of the loop unless `marks` is related to `n`.

3. The conditions `need_x` and `need_y` being False can affect what `additional_marks` contains, but we need to clarify their relationship to `marks`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- The `marks` variable should be defined and should contain elements for iteration.
- Since `additional_marks` is derived from `y` when both `need_x` and `need_y` are False, we may assume `marks` could be related to `additional_marks`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `marks` is defined and has at least one element. 

Based on the analysis, here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` is `y`, `marks` is a list that must contain at least 1 element**.
