Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to several issues in its logic regarding the addition of necessary marks.

Here are the main problems:

1. **Additional Marks Logic**: The program checks for pairs of existing marks that can measure distances `x` and `y`. While it correctly determines whether these distances are already measurable, it does not adequately ensure that both distances can be accounted for by potentially adding marks. Specifically, the program only adds `x` or `y` to the `additional_marks` list if they are not already measurable, but it does not account for the case where both `x` and `y` might not be directly measurable. 

2. **Combining Marks**: In the final part of the program where it tries to add sums of existing marks and the additional marks, it is creating new marks from the sums of existing marks and the marks it found to be necessary. However, this does not guarantee that the existing marks can form the necessary distances `x` and `y`. The program might end up with marks that do not help measure either `x` or `y`.

3. **Output Requirements**: The program outputs all additional marks found after the sums calculation but does not ensure that these marks are specifically those needed to measure `x` and `y`. The problem specifically states the need to measure distances `x` and `y`, and not just any distance that can be formed from existing marks.

For example, if the existing marks are such that both `x` and `y` are not possible to measure, the program may incorrectly add a mark that doesn't help in measuring both required distances. Furthermore, the program does not handle the constraints that `x < y` properly since it treats them equally when checking for possible measurements.

Overall, the logic does not guarantee that both required distances will be measurable with the minimum number of additional marks added. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.
