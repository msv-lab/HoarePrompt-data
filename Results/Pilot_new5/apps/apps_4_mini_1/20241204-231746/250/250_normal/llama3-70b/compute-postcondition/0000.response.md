Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9); `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l); `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the distances of the marks from the origin; `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are now assigned the values from `input`.**
