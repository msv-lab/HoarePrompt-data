The `additional_marks` list is modified by appending the value of `i + j` to it. The value of `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`, and `i` is assumed to be some integer (its value is not provided in the initial state). Since `additional_marks` contains at least one element, and `j` being the third element implies that there are at least three elements in `additional_marks`. 

The impact of this code is that it adds a new element to the `additional_marks` list. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` includes the new value `i + j`.**
