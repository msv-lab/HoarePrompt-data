The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. Since `need_y` was previously unspecified, it remains the same as after the assignment. The other variables' states are unchanged and remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`.**
