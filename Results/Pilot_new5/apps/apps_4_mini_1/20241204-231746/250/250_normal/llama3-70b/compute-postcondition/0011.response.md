According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i` and continues until it reaches `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000. The loop will execute again for `j = 0`, and then for each subsequent increment of `j` until it reaches `n - 1`. 

After the last iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to 1 (the next value in the range). Additionally, since `j` starts from `i`, `i` remains 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (which is already the case), allowing `j` to take on the value 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
