Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 3 viable values, and `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, then `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.***
