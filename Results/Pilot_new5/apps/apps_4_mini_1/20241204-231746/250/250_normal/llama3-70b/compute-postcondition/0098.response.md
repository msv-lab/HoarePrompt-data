`additional_marks` is updated by appending the sum of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is the second element of `marks` and `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`, this results in `additional_marks` being increased by one new element which is `i + j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element and now includes the value `i + j`, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`.**
