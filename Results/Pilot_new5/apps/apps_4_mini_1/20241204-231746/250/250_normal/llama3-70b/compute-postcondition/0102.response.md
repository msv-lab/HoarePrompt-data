Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` is updated to include the new element `i + j` if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`. If the condition is not met, `additional_marks` remains unchanged. `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.***
