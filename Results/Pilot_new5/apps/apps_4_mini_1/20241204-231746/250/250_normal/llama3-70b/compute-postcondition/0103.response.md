Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains all values `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its original values. If the loop executes, `additional_marks` may contain new values that are derived from adding `i` to each valid `j` found in `additional_marks` under the specified conditions.**
