According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. If it contains at least one more element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element while `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, after the current value of `j`, there must be another element in `additional_marks` for the loop to continue. 

Assuming `additional_marks` had at least two elements, if `j` was the first element, then the next `j` would be the second element of `additional_marks`. If `j` was the last element in the current state, then the loop cannot run again.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` (which must be the next element after the current `j`).**
