The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. The value of `j` is already known as the second element in `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will include all the unchanged variables, and we will note that `i + j` has been added to `additional_marks`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 element plus `i + j`, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`**.
