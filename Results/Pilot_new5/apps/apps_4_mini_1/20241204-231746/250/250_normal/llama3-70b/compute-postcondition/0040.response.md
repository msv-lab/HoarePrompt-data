Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` (0 ≤ j < n) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` (0 ≤ j < n) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`. If `n` is equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged.**
