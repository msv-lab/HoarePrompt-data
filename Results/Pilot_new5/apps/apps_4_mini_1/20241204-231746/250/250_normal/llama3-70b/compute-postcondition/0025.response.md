The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, `j`, and the expression `marks[j] - marks[i]` remain unchanged, and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is still equal to `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`, `need_x` is True**.
