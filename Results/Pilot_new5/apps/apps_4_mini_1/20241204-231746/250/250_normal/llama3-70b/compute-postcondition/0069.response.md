According to the code, the loop will execute based on the `additional_marks`, which is a variable that is iterable (likely a list or similar). To determine the states needed for the loop to execute, we must ensure that `additional_marks` contains at least one element; otherwise, the loop will not run. Given that `marks` is specified to contain at least one element, we can assume that `additional_marks` likely also needs to have at least one element.

Thus, the adjustments required for the loop to execute are that `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. Since the state indicates that `need_x` is False and `need_y` is False, we don't need to adjust these conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `marks` is a list that must contain at least 1 element**
