#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers representing marks. It checks for the existence of pairs in the marks that have differences of `x` and `y`. If no such pairs exist, it adds `x` and/or `y` to a list of additional marks. It then calculates all unique sums of existing marks and these additional marks that do not exceed `l` and are not already in the marks. Finally, it prints the count of these unique additional marks and the marks themselves.
