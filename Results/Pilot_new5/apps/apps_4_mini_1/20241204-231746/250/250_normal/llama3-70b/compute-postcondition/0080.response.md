According to the code, the loop iterates over the `marks` list, and since `marks` contains at least 1 element, the iteration can occur. The variable `i` takes on each value in `marks` in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be set to the last element of the `marks` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next value in the `marks` list. However, since `marks` is a list and would have been iterated completely, `i` will not have a next value after the last iteration.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we would need to ensure that either new elements are added to `marks` or reset the iterator to start from the beginning of the `marks` list. Without modification to `marks`, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains all viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `i` must be reset to the first element of the list (or new elements must be added to `marks`)**
