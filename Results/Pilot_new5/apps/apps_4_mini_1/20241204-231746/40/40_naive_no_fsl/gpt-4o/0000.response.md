To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic in detail.

The program reads a non-empty string `s` and checks for the longest substring that is not a palindrome. The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, it immediately prints `0` because single-character strings and empty strings are palindromes.
2. It uses a helper function `func_1(s)` to check if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
3. The program first checks if `s` itself is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints the length of `s`.
4. If `s` is a palindrome, it checks two cases:
   - If the substring without the first character (`s[1:]`) is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1.
   - If the substring without the last character (`s[:-1]`) is not a palindrome, it also prints the length of `s` minus 1.
5. If all possible substrings are palindromes, it finally prints `0`.

Now, let's consider the edge cases and the requirements:

- For the input "mew" (length 3), the program correctly returns `3` because "mew" is not a palindrome.
- For the input "wuffuw", the longest non-palindromic substring is "wuffu" (length 5), and the program correctly returns `5`.
- For "qqqqqqqq", all substrings are palindromes, and the program correctly returns `0`.

However, there are some inputs that reveal issues:

### Test Case Revealing Issues
1. **Input:** "aba"
   - Expected output: `2` (the longest non-palindromic substring is "ab" or "ba").
   - The program will check:
     - "aba" is a palindrome.
     - "ba" (which is `s[1:]`) is not a palindrome, so it prints `2` (correct).
   
2. **Input:** "aaaa"
   - Expected output: `0` (all substrings are palindromes).
   - The program will check:
     - "aaaa" is a palindrome.
     - "aaa" and "aaa" are also palindromes.
     - It prints `0` (correct).

3. **Input:** "abcba"
   - Expected output: `4` (the longest non-palindromic substring is "abcd" or "bca").
   - The program will check:
     - "abcba" is a palindrome.
     - "bcba" is also a palindrome.
     - It checks "abc" but fails to find a valid non-palindrome and ultimately returns `0` (incorrect).

The program fails to find the longest non-palindromic substring for certain palindromic inputs, primarily when the input contains a mix of characters (and the longest non-palindromic substring is produced by removing characters).

Given this analysis, the program does not handle the case where a palindrome can have valid non-palindromic substrings properly. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
