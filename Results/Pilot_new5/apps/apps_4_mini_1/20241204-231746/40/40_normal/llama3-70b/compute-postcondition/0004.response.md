To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, this means the loop will start at `j = 1`.
2. The loop will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` will be at least 1.

Now, we check the current state:
- `i` is 0, so `j` will start from 1.
- `n` is the length of the non-empty string `s`, which is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Thus, the loop can execute since `j` starts from 1 and `n` is at least 1.

To summarize: 
- At the start of the loop, `j` will be 1.
- `s` is a non-empty string and `n` is the length of `s`, which is at least 1.

The current state of the program is sufficient for the loop to execute. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
