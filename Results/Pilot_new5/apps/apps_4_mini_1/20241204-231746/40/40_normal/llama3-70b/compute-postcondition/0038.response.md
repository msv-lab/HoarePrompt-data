Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n â‰¥ 2) and `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome (i.e., `substr != substr[::-1]`), then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1, while `i` remains 2 and `j` remains 3. There is no else part in the code.***
