The `max_len` variable is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and the length of `substr`. The previous value of `max_len` is the maximum of its prior value and 1. The `substr` is equal to `s[2:4]`, which has a length of 2 (since `n` is at least 4). 

Therefore, if `max_len` was previously 1 or less, it will be updated to 2 (the length of `substr`). If it was greater than 2, it will remain unchanged. Other variables (`s`, `substr`, `i`, `j`) are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n â‰¥ 4); `substr` is equal to `s[2:4]`; `max_len` is either max of its previous value and 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 4.**
