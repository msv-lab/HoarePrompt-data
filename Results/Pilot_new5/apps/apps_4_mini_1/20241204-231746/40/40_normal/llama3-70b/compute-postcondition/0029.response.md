`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 4. Therefore, `substr` will now contain the substring of `s` starting from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 4, `substr` will be a valid substring of `s`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `max_len`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is now `s[1:4]`, `max_len` remains unchanged**.
