According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop starts with `j` being initialized to `i + 1`, which is 3 (since `i` is 2). The loop will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is still 2, and `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 4. Moreover, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n â‰¥ 4), `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
