The code assigns `max_len` the value of the maximum between its previous value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`, its length is 1 (as it takes only one character from the string `s`). Therefore, `max_len` is compared against its previous value (which is already updated to be at least 2) and remains unchanged since 2 is greater than 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n â‰¥ 4), `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`, `max_len` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 4.**
