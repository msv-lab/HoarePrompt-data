`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, `substr` will be the first character of the non-empty string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
