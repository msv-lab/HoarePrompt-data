The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`, which means it will take the characters from index 0 to index 3 (excluding index 3). The value of `i` is 0 and the value of `j` is 3, meaning `substr` will contain the first three characters of `s`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
