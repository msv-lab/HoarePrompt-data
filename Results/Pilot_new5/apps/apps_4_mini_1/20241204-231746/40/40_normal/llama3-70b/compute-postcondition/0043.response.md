According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to start from `i + 1` and run until `n + 1`. In this case, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, the range for `j` starts from 3 (since `i + 1` equals 3) and goes up to 5 (since `n + 1` is at least 5).

At the end of the last iteration, since `j` has not been used in the loop yet, it has not yet been incremented. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 3 in the next iteration. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, which is at least 4.

Thus, to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 3, and `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n â‰¥ 4), `substr` is equal to `s[2:4]`, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 4**
