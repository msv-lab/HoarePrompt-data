`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from the index `i` and ending at index `j`, which means it takes the elements from index 1 to index 3 (not including index 3) of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 3, `substr` will be a string consisting of the characters at indices 1 and 2 of `s`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, while `substr` is now defined. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]` (characters at indices 1 and 2 of `s`.**
