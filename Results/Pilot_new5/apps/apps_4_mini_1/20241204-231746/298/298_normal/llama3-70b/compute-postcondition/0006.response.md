Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `b` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It uses a recursive approach to calculate and return a tuple consisting of two values: one being the result of the extended Euclidean algorithm. The first value of the tuple is derived from the recursive call, while the second value is computed as `x - (a // b) * y`. If `b` is zero in a hypothetical scenario (though the code ensures this won't happen), it would return (1, 0). **
