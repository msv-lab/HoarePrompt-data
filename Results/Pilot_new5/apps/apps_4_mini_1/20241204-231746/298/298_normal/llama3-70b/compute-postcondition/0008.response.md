The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the function body, if `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which represents the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and if `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a` as the greatest common divisor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, and returns the value of a if b is 0.**
