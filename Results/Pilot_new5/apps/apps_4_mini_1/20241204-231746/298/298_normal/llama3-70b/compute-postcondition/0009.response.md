The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The loop continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point the function returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` directly without entering the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compute the GCD of two integers, handling the case where one of the integers may be zero by returning the non-zero integer or zero if both are zero.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), returning `a` if `b` is zero at the start. **
