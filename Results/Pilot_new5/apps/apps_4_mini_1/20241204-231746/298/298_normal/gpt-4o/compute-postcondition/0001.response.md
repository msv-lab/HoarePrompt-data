`area` is assigned the value of the expression `n * m / k`. The values of `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9. Therefore, `area` will be a float resulting from the division of the product of `n` and `m` by `k`. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`**.
