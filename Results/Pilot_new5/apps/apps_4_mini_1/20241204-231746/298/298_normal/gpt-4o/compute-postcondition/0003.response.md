The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not alter any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables while indicating that a 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and 'NO' has been printed.**
