The code snippet provided prints a formatted string that includes the value of `2 * area`. The initial state mentions that `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and it is confirmed to be an integer. The conditions also state that the value of `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`.

Given these conditions:

1. **Calculating `2 * area`:** 
   - Since `area = n * m / k`, then `2 * area = 2 * (n * m / k) = (2 * n * m) / k`.

2. **Output of the print statement:**
   - The output will be `1` followed by the value of `2 * area`.

There are no variables being changed as a result of the print statement; it simply computes and outputs values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, confirmed to be an integer, and `area` is not equal to 0. The value of `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and the current value of `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. The output printed is `1 (2 * area)` where `2 * area` is `(2 * n * m) / k`.**
