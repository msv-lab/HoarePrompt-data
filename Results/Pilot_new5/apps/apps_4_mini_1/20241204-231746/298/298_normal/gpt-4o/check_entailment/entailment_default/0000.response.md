To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the key elements.

**Problem Description:**
Vasya needs to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
- \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points must equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

The program must output "NO" if it's impossible to find such points, or "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points if it is possible.

**Program Analysis:**
1. It calculates the area using the formula \(area = n * m / k\).
2. It checks if the area is not an integer or is equal to zero and outputs "NO" in those cases.
3. If the area is valid, it attempts to find coordinates based on whether \(2 * area\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\).
4. Depending on those conditions, it prints specific coordinates.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. When \(k\) is larger than both \(n\) and \(m\), \(\frac{nm}{k}\) could yield very small values that lead to a situation where it should print "NO" but might not do so correctly due to rounding issues in the area calculation.
2. When \(n\) or \(m\) is very small (like 1), it could lead to invalid coordinates being generated.
3. The case when \(nm < k\) would also mean that the area would never be met, and this should lead to a "NO" response.
4. The code assumes certain conditions about generating valid points without checking if those points actually lead to a valid triangle area.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints state that the function prints "YES" and coordinates if the area is valid, and lists certain conditions under which coordinates are selected. It accurately reflects that the function will only provide "YES" if the area can be achieved.

However, there is a discrepancy regarding whether the points always yield the desired triangle area. For instance, the generated coordinates must actually form a triangle with the specified area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). A quick check shows that the function does not guarantee valid triangles in all scenarios based on the provided conditions.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the program does not consider certain edge cases effectively, specifically with regard to validating the generated points leading to the exact desired area. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description accurately for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 
The code does not ensure that the generated points form a triangle with the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) in every case, particularly in edge conditions where \(k\) is larger than the product of \(n\) and \(m\).
