To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The program needs to find three integer points such that:
1. The coordinates of the points must be within the bounds defined by `n` and `m`.
2. The area of the triangle formed by the points should equal `nm/k`.

### Program Logic
1. The program first computes the area as `area = n * m / k`.
2. It checks if `area` is an integer. If not, it prints "NO" because the area must be a whole number.
3. If `area` is 0, it also prints "NO". This case should only happen if `n` or `m` is zero, but by constraints, `n` and `m` are at least 1.
4. If `area` is valid, it proceeds to determine the coordinates of the points:
   - It tries to assign coordinates based on whether `2 * area` fits within `n` or `m`.
   - It prints three points based on its logic.

### Potential Issues with the Implementation
1. **Checking for Integer Area**: The program uses `area != int(area)` to check if the area is an integer. A potential pitfall is that floating point division can introduce small errors, although in this case, the integers involved are guaranteed by the constraints.
2. **Handling of Area**: The program assumes that if `2 * area` is less than or equal to either `n` or `m`, it can construct valid points. However, there might be cases where the calculated points fall outside the bounds of the grid defined by `n` and `m`. For example:
   - If `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 2`, the area will be `0.5`. The program will yield "NO" since the area is not an integer, which is correct.
   - If `n = 5`, `m = 5`, and `k = 2`, the area will be `12.5`, and the program will also yield "NO". However, if `k = 3`, the area will be `8.33`, causing it to yield a valid triangle where points might not bound properly.

### Testing for Edge Cases
Let's consider an example:
- For `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 10`, the area will be `0.6`, and the program will print "NO".
- For `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`, the area will be `2`, and the points could be `(0, 0)`, `(2, 1)`, `(0, 1)`, which all fit within the bounds.

### Conclusion
- The program fails when the area is not an integer but does not check for other configurations that could lead to invalid points being returned.
- In particular, if `2 * area` is calculated near the limits of `n` or `m`, it may yield coordinates that exceed the bounds.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, and thus:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not guarantee that the points will always lie within the defined boundary based on the provided inputs, particularly when the area is valid but the conditions for constructing points do not account for boundary limits effectively.
