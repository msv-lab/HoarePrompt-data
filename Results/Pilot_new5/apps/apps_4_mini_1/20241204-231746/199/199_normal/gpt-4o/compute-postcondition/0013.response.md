In the given code snippet, the variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. The initial state shows that `a` is 2, and `b` is initially 1. Thus, after the execution of the code, `b` will take the value of `a`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here’s how the output state looks after running the code:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 6); `count` is set to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is `n - 4`, which is greater than 0 and even.**
