Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 6); `count` is set to 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `rem` is `n - 4` (where `rem` is greater than 0 and even). If the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2, then `count` is updated to 1; otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part in the code.***
