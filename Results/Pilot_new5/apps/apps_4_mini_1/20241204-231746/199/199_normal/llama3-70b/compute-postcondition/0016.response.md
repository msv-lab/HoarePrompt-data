The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7. The initial condition states that `2 * (a + b) = n`, and since `a` is 2 and `b` is 2, the equation holds true. Thus, `ways` increases by 1, reflecting a new valid pair.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `ways` is the count of valid pairs incremented by 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and the current values of `a` and `b` are not equal.**
