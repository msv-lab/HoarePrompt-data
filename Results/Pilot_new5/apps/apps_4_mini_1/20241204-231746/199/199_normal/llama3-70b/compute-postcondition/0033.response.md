According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variables `b` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is some integer value that is at least `a`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`. 

If `b` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. Thus, after the current iteration, `b` will be `b + 1`, and we need to ensure the loop can run again.

Since `n` is at least `2 * (b + 1) + a`, we can state that for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`, `ways` remains unchanged, `b` is `b + 1`**
