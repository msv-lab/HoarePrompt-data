The value of `ways` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unspecified, so it remains unchanged in the context of this output. The value of `b` is updated to `b + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as it is unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`, `ways` is increased by 1, `b` is `b + 1`.**
