Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the count of distinct pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b` equals `n / 2` and `a` is not equal to `b`. If no such pairs exist, it returns 0. The function will only find pairs where both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `n/2`, ensuring that the pairs are valid. **
