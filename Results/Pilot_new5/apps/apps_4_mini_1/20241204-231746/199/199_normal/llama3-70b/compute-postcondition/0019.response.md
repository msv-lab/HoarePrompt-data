The variable `ways` is incremented by 1. The condition given states that `ways` is incremented if `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b) == n`. Given that `a` is 2 and `b` is 3, we can evaluate:

1. `a` is not equal to `b` (2 â‰  3) - this condition is true.
2. `2 * (a + b) == n` translates to `2 * (2 + 3) == n`, which simplifies to `2 * 5 == n` or `10 == n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, this condition can potentially be satisfied if `n` equals 10.

Since the conditions for incrementing `ways` are satisfied (assuming `n` is 10), `ways` is incremented by 1. The other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8; `a` is 2; `b` is 3; `ways` is incremented by 1.**
