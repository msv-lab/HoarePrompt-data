To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to split a stick of length \( n \) into four parts such that:

1. Each part must have a positive integer length.
2. It's possible to form a rectangle from these parts.
3. It's impossible to form a square from these parts.

A rectangle can be formed if we have two pairs of equal lengths, while a square cannot be formed if we do not have all four parts of equal length.

The program starts by checking if \( n < 6 \) and returns 0 in that case, which is correct since with a stick length less than 6, it's impossible to make four positive lengths.

The program then iterates through possible lengths \( a \) for the two identical parts, setting \( b = a \) for the other two identical parts. It calculates the remaining length after accounting for these two parts and checks if it can be split into two equal lengths. Specifically, it checks if the remaining length is positive and even.

However, there is a flaw in the logic when it comes to counting the distinct ways of cutting the stick. The condition `if a != rem // 2` is insufficient to guarantee that the configuration can avoid forming a square. The program does not account for the scenario when \( n \) is even and \( a \) and \( rem / 2 \) could potentially be equal, which would lead to the formation of a square (e.g., when \( n = 8 \), \( a = 2 \), leading to parts {2, 2, 2, 2}).

We can consider a specific counter-example:
- For \( n = 8 \), the only configuration the program allows based on the conditions would be {2, 2, 2, 2}, which is a square and should not be counted.

Given this analysis, the program fails to account for all cases correctly as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
