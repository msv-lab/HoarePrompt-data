`mex` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 4 and `num` is the third element in the list `a` (if n is greater than 2).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 4, and `num` is the third element in the list `a` (if n is greater than 2)**.
