The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are expected to be space-separated integers) to integers. The length of this list will be `n`, which is a positive integer and is updated based on user input. The values of the list elements `a[i]` will be positive integers, satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9.

Since `n` is updated to the number of integers provided in the input and `a` now contains these integers, the output state reflects that `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`, and `a` consists of the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the input list (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.**
