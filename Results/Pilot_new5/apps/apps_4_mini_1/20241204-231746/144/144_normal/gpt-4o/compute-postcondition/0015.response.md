The code prints the value of `mex`. Since `mex` is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and it may also take the value of `n + 1` if all integers from 1 to `n` are present, the output state will convey that `mex` is printed, without changing any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and `mex` has been printed.**
