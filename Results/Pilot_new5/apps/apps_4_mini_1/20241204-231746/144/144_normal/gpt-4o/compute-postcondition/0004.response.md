According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in the sorted list `a`. Since `n` is the length of the list and is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the loop will execute provided that the list `a` has at least one integer. The variable `mex` is already initialized to 1, which can be relevant within the loop but does not affect the initial execution of the loop itself. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we must ensure the following conditions hold:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since n is defined as the length of the list and is stated to be a positive integer).
- `a` should contain elements, which it does since `n` is at least 1.
- `num` will take on the value of the first element in the list during the first iteration.

Thus, the state can be summarized as:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**.
