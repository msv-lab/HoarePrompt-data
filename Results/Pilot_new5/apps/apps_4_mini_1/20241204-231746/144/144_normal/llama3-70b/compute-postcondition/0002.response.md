The `arr` list is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it only specifies the number of elements in `arr`. The specific order of the elements in `arr` is altered, but since `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, the final state will indicate that `arr` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers.**
