Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mex` is 1, and `num` is not equal to `mex`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
