The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Since `mex` can only be 1 or 2 depending on the value of `num`, after the increment, `mex` will either be 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; and `mex` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mex` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `mex`.**
