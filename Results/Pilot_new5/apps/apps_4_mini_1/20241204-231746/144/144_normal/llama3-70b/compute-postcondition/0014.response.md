The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `mex` must be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
