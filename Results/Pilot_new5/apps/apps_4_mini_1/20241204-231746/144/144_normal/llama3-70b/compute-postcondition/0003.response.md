The code assigns the value `1` to `mex`. The previous value of `mex` was not defined, but now it is explicitly set to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 1**.
