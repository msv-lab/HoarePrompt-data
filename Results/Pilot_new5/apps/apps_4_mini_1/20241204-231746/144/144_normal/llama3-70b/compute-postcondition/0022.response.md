To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's structure and how it interacts with the given variables. 

The loop iterates through each element in the sorted list `arr`, comparing each `num` with the current value of `mex`. It increments `mex` if `num` equals `mex`, and breaks out of the loop if `num` is greater than `mex`.

After iterating through the list:
- If the loop completes without breaking, `mex` will be incremented for each `num` in `arr` that matches its previous value, starting from 1. Thus, if all the numbers from 1 to `k` exist in `arr`, `mex` will be `k + 1` after the loop.
- If the loop breaks before reaching the end of `arr`, it can be deduced that there is a missing integer less than or equal to `mex`, which caused the break.

Considering these points, we conclude the following:

- If `arr` contains all integers from 1 to `k` (where `k` is the largest element in `arr` that matches `mex`), then `mex` will be `k + 1`.
- If `arr` does not contain a number equal to `mex` and the iteration breaks, then `mex` remains equal to the smallest integer that wasn't found in the list.

Therefore, we can consolidate the output state based on the outcomes described above.

Output State: **`mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000.**
