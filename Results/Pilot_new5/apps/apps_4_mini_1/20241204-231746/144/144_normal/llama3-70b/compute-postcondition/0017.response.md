According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute again hinges on the `arr` list and its elements. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `arr` contains at least 2 elements. The loop iterates over each element in `arr`, and since `num` is currently the second element, the next value of `num` will be the third element in the list, assuming it exists.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, such that `num` will be the third element in the next iteration. 

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements, we can ensure that the conditions are met if `n` is at least 3.

Thus, if `num` is the second element, in the next iteration, `num` will be the third element of `arr`, and since the loop is dependent on `arr`, it will execute again as long as `arr` has at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`.**
