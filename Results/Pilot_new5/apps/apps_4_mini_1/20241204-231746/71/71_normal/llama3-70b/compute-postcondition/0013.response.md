The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer, constrained by the relationship \(0 \leq n \leq 2,000,000,000\). The parameter `k` is a positive integer, constrained by the relationship \(1 \leq k \leq 9\). Based on the execution of the function, the exact output has not been provided. However, we can summarize the functionality based on the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter n (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000) and a positive integer parameter k (1 ≤ k ≤ 9).**
