To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's first analyze the code:

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

### Problem Description Recap
1. The goal is to remove the least number of digits from the number `n` to make it divisible by \(10^k\).
2. The result should not start with unnecessary leading zeros unless the result is zero itself.

### Output Hints Summary
The function keeps dividing `n` by 10 until `n` becomes divisible by \(10^k\) and counts how many digits are removed in the process. 

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Leading Zeros**: The description states that after removing digits, the result should not have unnecessary leading zeros. However, the code does not explicitly handle cases where there may be leading zeros after removing digits.
2. **Special Cases of Zero**: If `n` is `0`, the output should be `0` digits removed, as the result `0` is valid and is divisible by any power of 10.
3. **Higher Values of \(k\)**: If `k` is larger than the number of trailing zeros in `n`, the while loop may reduce `n` to a point where it becomes zero without any meaningful output for the number of digits removed.

### Checking the Output Hints
The hints state that the function counts how many times `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\) by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 until it becomes divisible. This aligns with the logic of the code; however, it does not account for all potential cases described previously.

### Example Scenarios
- For input `30020 3`, the expected output is `1`, which is correct as the function will remove one `2` to get `3000`.
- For input `100 9`, the expected output is `2` as it can become `0`. The function will count the removal correctly.
- For input `10203049 2`, the expected output is `3`. The function will remove `3` digits correctly.
- For input `0 1`, the expected output should be `0` (because zero is valid), but the code may not reach this condition properly.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the edge case of leading zeros and does not adequately process the special case of `0` correctly. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
