The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; if `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0; otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. The current value of `count_zeros` equals `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
