Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9. If `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is increased by 1 and `to_remove` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `digit` is not '0', `count_zeros` remains unchanged and `to_remove` is incremented by 1.***
