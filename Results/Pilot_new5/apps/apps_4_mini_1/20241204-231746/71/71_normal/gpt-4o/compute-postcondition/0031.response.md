The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer that must be less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, while `k` is a positive integer constrained such that 1 <= k <= 9. The function's output is based on the values of these parameters. However, no specific cases or return values were provided in the output description. Therefore, without additional details, I cannot determine the specific functionality of the function based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and `k`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 9. The specific output behavior is not specified.**
