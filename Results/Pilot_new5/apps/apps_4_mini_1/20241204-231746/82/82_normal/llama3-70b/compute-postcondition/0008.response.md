The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Since `b` is 0, `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `a` and `b`, and return `a` as the GCD of the original `a` and `b` when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, both integers, and returns a, which is the GCD of a and b, given that b is 0.**
