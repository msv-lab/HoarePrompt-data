#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of a, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b, and since b is 0, a remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function continues to compute the GCD until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`, which holds the GCD. This implementation correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is 0, as GCD(0, x) is defined to be x.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of the expression a * b divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns the result of the expression `a * b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will lead to a division by zero error. The function does not handle this case, so it may result in an error during execution if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0.
