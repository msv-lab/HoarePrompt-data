Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
