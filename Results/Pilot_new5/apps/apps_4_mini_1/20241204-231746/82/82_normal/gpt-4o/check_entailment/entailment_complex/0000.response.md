To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the code and the problem description to ensure that it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap
Neko needs to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If multiple values of \( k \) yield the same minimal LCM, the smallest such \( k \) should be returned.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function func_1**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The logic appears correct.

2. **Function func_2**:
   - This function computes the LCM of two integers using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). There is a note in the annotations about a potential division by zero, but since both \( x \) and \( y \) are guaranteed to be positive integers (1 ≤ \( a, b \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)), this is not an issue in this context.

3. **Function func_3**:
   - This function handles the main logic:
     - If \( a \) equals \( b \), it returns \( 0 \) immediately, which is correct since the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) would simply be \( a \) (or \( b \)).
     - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
     - It then iterates through potential divisors of `diff`, computing new values for \( a \) and \( b \) based on candidates derived from the divisors. 
     - The logic attempts to find the minimum LCM based on adjusted values of \( a \) and \( b \) and keeps track of the optimal \( k \).

### Edge Cases and Concerns
1. **Candidate Calculation**: The algorithm checks divisors of the difference `diff`, which can yield \( k \) values that may not cover all potential \( k \) values effectively. For small values of `diff`, the range may not capture larger values of \( k \) that could yield a smaller LCM.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns `min_k`, which corresponds to the candidate used to minimize LCM. However, if `min_k` is determined solely from the divisors of `diff`, this can miss other potentially optimal \( k \) values.

### Example Analysis
- Given the example input `6 10`, the program correctly returns `2`, as calculated LCM values support this.
- The input `21 31` results in `9`, which appears accurate upon reevaluation.
- The input `5 10` correctly results in `0`.

### Missing Cases
However, consider the case where `a = 1` and `b = 2`. The potential values for \( k \) start from `0`:
- \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2
- \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6
- \( k = 2 \): LCM(3, 4) = 12

The function would return `0`, which is indeed correct here, but this method could overlook cases where intermediate values could yield a better result.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and its logic against the problem statement, I identified that while the function might yield correct results for various examples, the approach taken in `func_3` does not guarantee covering all possibilities for \( k \), leading to scenarios where it may not return the optimal solution.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirement of finding the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
