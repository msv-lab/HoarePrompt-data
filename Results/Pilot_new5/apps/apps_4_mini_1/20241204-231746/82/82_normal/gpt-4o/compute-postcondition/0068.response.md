`new_b` is assigned the value of the nearest multiple of `candidate` (which is `diff // 3`) that is greater than or equal to `b`. The previous value of `b` is a positive integer, and `candidate` is also a positive integer (since `diff` is positive and `diff >= 9`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
