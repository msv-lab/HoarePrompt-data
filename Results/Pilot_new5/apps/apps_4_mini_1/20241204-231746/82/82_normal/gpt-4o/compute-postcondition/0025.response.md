To determine the output state after executing the code, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables provided in the initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a positive integer.
   - `candidate` is `diff // k`.
   - `min_lcm` is as per the last update condition.
   - `min_k` is as per the last update condition.
   - `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   ```
   new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   ```
   - The variable `new_b` gets assigned a value based on the calculations involving `b` and `candidate`.
   - Since `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is derived from a division operation (which is non-negative), both parts of the expression calculate to a non-negative integer.
   - The expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate` computes an integer division after adjusting `b`, which could potentially round `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

3. **Output Values**:
   - `new_b` becomes a multiple of `candidate` that is at least as large as `b`.

4. **Unchanged Variables**:
   - The values of `a`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `candidate`, and `new_a` remain unchanged.

Putting all this information together into the required output format:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is as per the last update condition, `min_k` is as per the last update condition, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
