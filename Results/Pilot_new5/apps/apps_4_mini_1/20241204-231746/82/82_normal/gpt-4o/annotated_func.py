    while y:

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, where y is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program effectively returns the value of x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. If one of the inputs is zero, it returns the other input as the GCD. The behavior is undefined if both inputs are zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of x multiplied by y divided by the result of func_1(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the product of `x` and `y` divided by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. The function does not handle cases where `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, which would result in a division by zero error.

If no valid candidates were found, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple of new_a and new_b, with min_lcm being the minimum least common multiple calculated for each valid candidate. If no valid candidates were found, min_k remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, finds candidates that could minimize the least common multiple (LCM) of adjusted values of `a` and `b`, and returns the smallest candidate that yields the minimum LCM. If no valid candidates are found, it returns 0.
