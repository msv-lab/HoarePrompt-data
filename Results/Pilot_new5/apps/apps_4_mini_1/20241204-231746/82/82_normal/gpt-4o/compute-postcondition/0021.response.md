The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers; `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `candidate` is equal to `diff`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `candidate` is equal to `diff`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
