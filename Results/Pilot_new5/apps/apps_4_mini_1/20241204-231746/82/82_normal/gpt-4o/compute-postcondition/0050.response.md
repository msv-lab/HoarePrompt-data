Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is now `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
