Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` after evaluating candidates; `min_k` is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple. `new_a` is the smallest multiple of the optimal candidate greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the smallest multiple of the optimal candidate greater than or equal to `b`.**
