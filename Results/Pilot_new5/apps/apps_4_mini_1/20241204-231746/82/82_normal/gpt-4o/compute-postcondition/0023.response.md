According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. The variable `candidate` takes values from this list. The list will have two elements, and the loop will execute for each of these elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `candidate` was the first element (`k`), then for the next iteration, `candidate` will take the second element (`diff // k`). If it was the second element, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in the list.

Based on the information provided, since `candidate` has taken one of the values from the list, we can deduce the following:

1. If `candidate` is `k`, then for the next iteration, `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
2. If `candidate` is `diff // k`, then the loop cannot continue.

Since we only know that `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` with certain conditions leading to updates, we need to ensure that `candidate` is set to the next possible value in the list.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is as per the last update condition, and `min_k` is as per the last update condition.**
