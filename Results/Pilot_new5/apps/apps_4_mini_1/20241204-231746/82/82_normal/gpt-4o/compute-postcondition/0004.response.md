`min_lcm` is assigned the value of positive infinity, which is a special floating-point representation indicating an infinitely large number. The values of `a`, `b`, and `diff` remain unchanged, and `min_lcm` takes on a new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity.**
