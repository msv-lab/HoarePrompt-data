Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either 3 or `diff // 3`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the iterations, and `min_k` is the candidate corresponding to `min_lcm`. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains the initial minimum value, `min_k` remains undefined or unchanged.**
