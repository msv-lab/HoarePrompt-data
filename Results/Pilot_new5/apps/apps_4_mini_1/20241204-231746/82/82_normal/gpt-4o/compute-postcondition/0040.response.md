Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2. If the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to equal `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to equal `candidate`, `k` remains as 2, `new_a` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.***
