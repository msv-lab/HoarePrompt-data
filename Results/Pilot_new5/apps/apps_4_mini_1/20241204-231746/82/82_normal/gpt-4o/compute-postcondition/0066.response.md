According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. In this case, `k` is 3, and `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9. Therefore, the second element of the list `diff // k` will depend on the value of `diff`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is set to 3 (the first element of the list). For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next candidate, which is `diff // k`. Since `diff` is at least 9, `diff // k` will be at least 3 (because 9 divided by 3 is 3) and could be greater based on the value of `diff`.

However, once the loop has processed the first candidate (3), it will process the second candidate (which is `diff // k`). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the candidate will now be set to `diff // k`, which will reflect the value based on the current `diff`. 

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + 2) // 3 * 3`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
