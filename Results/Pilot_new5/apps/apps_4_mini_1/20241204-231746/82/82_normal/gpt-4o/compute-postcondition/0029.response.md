Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
