According to the code, the loop iterates over a list consisting of the values `[k, diff // k]`, which means it will execute for the first time with `candidate` equal to `k` (which is 2) and for the second time with `candidate` equal to `diff // k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is equal to `diff // 2` from the first iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the next candidate value will be `diff // k` where `k` is 2. 

Since `candidate` is updated in each iteration of the loop, after the first iteration, the next value of `candidate` will be `diff // k`. The loop will execute again as long as the list contains at least two elements, which it does.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
