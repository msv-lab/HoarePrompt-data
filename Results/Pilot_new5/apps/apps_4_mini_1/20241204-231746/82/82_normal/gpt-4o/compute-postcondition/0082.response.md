Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for each valid candidate, and `min_k` is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple. If no valid candidates were found, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.**
