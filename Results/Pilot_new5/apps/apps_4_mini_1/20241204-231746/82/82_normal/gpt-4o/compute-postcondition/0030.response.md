Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for each candidate, `min_k` is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple, `k` remains 1, and `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.**
