The variable `new_b` is calculated based on the value of `b` and `candidate`, which is equal to `diff`. The formula for `new_b` updates it to `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`. The previous value of `b` is not changed, but `new_b` will be updated based on that formula. The values of `a`, `new_a`, `candidate`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `candidate` is equal to `diff`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
