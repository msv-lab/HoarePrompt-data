The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It is a control statement that causes the loop to skip the remaining statements and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
