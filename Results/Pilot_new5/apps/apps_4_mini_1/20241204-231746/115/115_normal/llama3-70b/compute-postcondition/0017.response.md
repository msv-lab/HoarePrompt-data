The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and immediately proceed to the next iteration. However, since the context of the loop is not provided, we cannot make any changes to the state of the variables, nor do we have any information about breaking out of it. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` is an empty list, and we skip to the next iteration of the closest loop.**
