The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the loop. Additionally, there is no impact on the `ops` list since it only appends (3, 1) if certain conditions involving `A` are met. Since the code does not specify the state of `A`, we cannot determine if those conditions were met.

Thus, we conclude that the state of the variables remains unchanged in terms of their values, but we acknowledge that the flow of execution continues to the next iteration of the loop without affecting the current values.

Output State: **`n` must be 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the `ops` list remains unchanged unless `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is equal to 1, in which case, the `ops` list is appended with (3, 1).**
