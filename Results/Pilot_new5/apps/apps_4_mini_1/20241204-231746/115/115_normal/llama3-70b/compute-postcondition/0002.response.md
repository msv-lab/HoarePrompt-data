The code initializes an empty list named `ops`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The 2D list `A` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of the variables, while noting that `ops` has been initialized.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the new input values; `ops` is an empty list.**
