The code snippet provided appends a tuple containing the values `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the values being appended are `(1, 2)`. The list `ops` was initially empty, so it will now contain one element: the tuple `(1, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and `A` do not affect this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ops` is [(1, 2)]**
