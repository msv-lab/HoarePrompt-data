Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `ops` is an empty list. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, we skip to the next iteration of the closest loop.***
