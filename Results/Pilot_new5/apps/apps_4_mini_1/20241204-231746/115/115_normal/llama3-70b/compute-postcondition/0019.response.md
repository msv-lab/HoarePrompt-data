The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The current values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` evaluates to `(1, 3)`. The list `ops` will now contain this tuple.

The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the elements of the list `A` does not affect the variables in the output state since it does not indicate any modifications or conditions being met.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` is now [(1, 3)].**
