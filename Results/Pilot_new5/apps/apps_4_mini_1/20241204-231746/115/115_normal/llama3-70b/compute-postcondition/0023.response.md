According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is at least 1, which means that `m` must be at least 2. Given that `m` is between 2 and 50, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, `j` is initialized to 0 (since the `range(m - 1)` starts from 0), which will be the first value of `j` in the loop. The loop will iterate until `j` reaches `m - 2`. 

Thus, to summarize the essential states:

State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples of the form (1, 1) for the first iteration**.
