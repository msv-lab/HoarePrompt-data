Output State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, and the `ops` list contains tuples of the form (3, k) for each column `k` in the range from 1 to `m - 1` where at least one of `A[2][k-1]`, `A[3][k-1]`, `A[2][k]`, or `A[3][k]` equals 1. If no tuples were appended, the `ops` list remains unchanged.**
