Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, the tuple (2, 2) is included in `ops`. Otherwise, the program does not execute any further statements.***
