Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `ops` is an empty list. If any of the conditions `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equal 1 are true, then `ops` is updated to contain the tuple (1, 1). Otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.***
