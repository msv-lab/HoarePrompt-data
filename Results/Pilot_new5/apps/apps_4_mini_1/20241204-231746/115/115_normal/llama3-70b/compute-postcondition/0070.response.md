The operation prints the first two elements of the list `op`. Since there are no changes to the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, or `j`, and the operation does not alter any variables, we only need to reflect what is printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed.**
