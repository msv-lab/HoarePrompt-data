The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`, both of which are integers constrained such that 2 <= n, m <= 50. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `A`, which is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where each element is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the output is not specified in the given information. Therefore, I cannot describe the return value or functionality. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), m (integer), and A (2D list of integers with dimensions n x m), but the return value or specific functionality is not provided.**
