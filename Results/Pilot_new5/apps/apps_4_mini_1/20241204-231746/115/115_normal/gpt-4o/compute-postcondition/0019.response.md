Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.***
