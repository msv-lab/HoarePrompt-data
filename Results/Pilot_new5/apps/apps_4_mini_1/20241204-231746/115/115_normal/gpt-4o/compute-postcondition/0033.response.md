According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is at least 1, which means `m` must be at least 2. Given that `m` is between 2 and 50, there are valid values for `m` that allow the loop to execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `j` should start from 0, as `j` is initialized in the loop. The state of `i` being `n - 1` does not impact the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0**
