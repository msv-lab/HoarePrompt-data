According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1, and since `m` is at least 2, it can still accommodate this increment.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the elements A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal.**
