Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `B[n - 1][0]` is set to 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is set to 1, `B[n][0]` is set to 1, `B[n][1]` is set to 1, and `operations` has a new entry `(n, 1)`.***
