According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been increased by 1. Since the loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, the maximum value of `i` before the loop ends would be `n - 2`. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. After the last iteration, if `i` was `n - 2`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute once more, `i` needs to be `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1; `B` is a 2D list that reflects the counts of 2x2 blocks in `A` where all four elements are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples containing the positions of those blocks in 1-based indexing, `i` is `n - 1`**.
