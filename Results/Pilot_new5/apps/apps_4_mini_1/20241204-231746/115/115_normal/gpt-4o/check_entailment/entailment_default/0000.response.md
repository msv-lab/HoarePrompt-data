To determine if the provided Python program is correct according to the problem description, let's analyze the code, the problem requirements, and the output hints.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have two matrices, A and B.
2. Matrix A contains elements that are either 0 or 1.
3. Matrix B starts as a zero matrix of the same dimensions as A.
4. We can perform operations on matrix B to try to make it match matrix A. Each operation involves setting a 2x2 submatrix of B to 1.
5. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make B equal to A by performing these operations.

### Code Analysis:
- The program first reads dimensions `n` and `m`, and then constructs matrix A.
- It initializes an empty operations list and creates matrix B filled with zeros.
- The code iterates through all possible positions for the top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in A. If a 2x2 block of 1s is found in A, it marks the corresponding positions in B as 1 and records the operation.
- After attempting to fill matrix B, it checks whether B matches A. If there is any discrepancy, it returns -1. Otherwise, it outputs the number of operations and their positions.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Partial Coverage**: The code only looks for 2x2 blocks of 1s in matrix A. If A has isolated 1s or blocks of 1s that cannot form a complete 2x2 square, those won't be accounted for, leading to a mismatch between A and B.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The loop structure ensures only indices where a full 2x2 matrix can fit are checked. This might skip isolated or edge cases where 1s are not in a complete square.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function identifies all 2x2 blocks of 1s in A.
- It returns -1 if any element in A does not match the corresponding element in B after operations.

The hints align with the code's functionality. However, they do not explicitly mention the issue of isolated 1s or the inability to fill certain configurations of A that cannot be achieved with the allowed operations. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:
```
Input:
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- The expected output should be a sequence of operations that fills B appropriately.
- The provided code will detect the 2x2 block at (1, 1) but will fail to recognize that it can't fill B to match A due to the isolated 1s in the last column.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle cases where isolated 1s exist that cannot be reached by the operations allowed (e.g., when a 2x2 block isn't possible due to the configuration of 1s). This leads to situations where B cannot be made equal to A, but the code would still output a successful operation sequence if at least one 2x2 block is filled incorrectly.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
