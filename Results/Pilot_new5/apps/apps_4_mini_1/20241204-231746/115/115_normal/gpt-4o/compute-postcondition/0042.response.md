According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. This means that `m` must be greater than `2`. 

Since `j` is currently 1, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Therefore, to allow for one more execution of the loop, `m` must be at least 3 (so that `j` is still less than `m - 1`).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 2**
