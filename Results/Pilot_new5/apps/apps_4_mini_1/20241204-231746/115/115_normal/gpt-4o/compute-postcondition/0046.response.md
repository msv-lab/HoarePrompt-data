Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is at least `m - 1`. If the conditions for all pairs `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` being equal to 1 are satisfied for any `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, then `B[n-1][j]`, `B[n-1][j + 1]`, `B[n][j]`, and `B[n][j + 1]` will be set to 1 for those `j`, and `operations` will include tuples `(n, 1), (n, 2), ..., (n, m-1)` for each successful iteration. If none of the conditions are satisfied, `B` remains unchanged and `operations` will be empty.**
