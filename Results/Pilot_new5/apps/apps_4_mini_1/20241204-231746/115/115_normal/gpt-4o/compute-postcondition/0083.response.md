Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m`, and A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all j from 0 to m-1; specifically, A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all values of j in the range [0, m-1]. The loop verifies all elements in the row indexed by i in matrices A and B are equal, and if they are not, the function would return -1. Since all A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j], no return value is specified.**
