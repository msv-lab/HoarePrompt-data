The `operations` list is being appended with the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `1`, we can substitute these values into the tuple:

- `i + 1` becomes `(n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `j + 1` becomes `1 + 1`, which simplifies to `2`.

Therefore, the tuple that gets appended to `operations` is `(n, 2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 2)`**.
