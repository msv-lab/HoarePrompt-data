The code is updating certain values in the 2D list `B` based on given indices. The initial conditions state that `B[i][1]` and `B[i][2]` are both set to 1. The operation modifies values in the list `B` at specific indices using the values of `i`, `j`, and the expression provided.

Given:
- `i` is updated to `i + 1` from the `operations` tuple.
- `j` is `m - 1`, which is the last column index.
- The updates to `B` will change multiple entries:

  1. `B[i][j]` becomes 1.
  2. `B[i][j + 1]` becomes 1.
  3. `B[i + 1][j]` becomes 1.
  4. `B[i + 1][j + 1]` becomes 1.

After executing the code, the specific values of certain elements of `B` are altered based on the operations described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` has updated values `B[i + 1][j] = 1, B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1, B[i][j] = 1, B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `j` is `m - 1`.**
