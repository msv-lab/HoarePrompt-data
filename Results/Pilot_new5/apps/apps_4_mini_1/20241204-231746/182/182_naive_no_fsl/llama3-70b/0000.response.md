Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly computes the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed based on the input angle `x`.

### Problem with the Code:

1. The program uses the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` to determine the number of 90-degree rotations. However, this does not take into account negative angles correctly, particularly for angles that result in needing more than 3 turns.
2. For example, let's consider an input angle of `-90`. According to the problem description, this indicates that the camera was rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The image would be rotated 90 degrees clockwise as a result of this. Therefore, it would require exactly 1 clockwise turn to align the image correctly, but the formula would yield an incorrect result.
3. Another problematic case is when `x = -180`. The camera is rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise, which should require 2 clockwise turns to correct, but the calculation does not handle this properly.

### Example Case:
- **Input:** `-90` 
  - Expected Output: `1` (as one 90-degree clockwise turn corrects the -90 degree rotation).
  - Actual Output from the program: `3` (since `(270 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` gives 3).

Due to these discrepancies and the incorrect handling of negative angles, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem for all inputs.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
