The `print(turns)` statement outputs the value of the variable `turns`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees), `normalized_angle` (equal to `x % 360`), and `turns` (equal to `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`). The value of `turns` is determined by evaluating the expression based on the value of `normalized_angle`.

Since the value of `turns` is computed but not modified or assigned to any other variable in this code snippet, the other variables retain their previous relationships, and we only need to output the value of `turns`.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is equal to `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, and the printed value of `turns` is returned.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is equal to `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` and the printed value of `turns` is returned.**
