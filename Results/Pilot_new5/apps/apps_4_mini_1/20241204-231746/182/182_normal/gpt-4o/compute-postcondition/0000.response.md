`x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input that represents the camera rotation angle in degrees. The previous state of `x` was an integer within the range of -10^18 to 10^18. Now, `x` will hold a new integer value based on user input, while the range condition is still valid.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, and `x` is the input integer.**
