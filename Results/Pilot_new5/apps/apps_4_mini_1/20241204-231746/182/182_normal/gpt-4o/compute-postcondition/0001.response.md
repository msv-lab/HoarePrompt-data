The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`. The value of `x` can be any integer in the range of -10^18 to 10^18, thus the result of `x % 360` will yield a result in the range of -359 to 359, effectively normalizing the angle to fit within a full rotation. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, and `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360.**
