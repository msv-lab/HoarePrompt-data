The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to correct an image taken from a camera that has been rotated by an angle `x`. However, the implementation does not accurately follow the problem description.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Normalization and Calculation Logic**: The program calculates `normalized_angle` as `x % 360`, which gives the effective angle after wrapping. If `x` is negative, this still can yield a negative value which does not represent the correct angle of rotation required for correction. The problem states that the image is rotated counter-clockwise when the camera rotates clockwise. The formula used in the program does not account for the requirement to minimize the deviation from vertical correctly.

2. **Returning to Original Orientation**: The program's logic is based on returning the camera to its original orientation rather than minimizing the deviation from vertical. This does not align with the problem's requirements, which state that the goal is to minimize the deviation from vertical after considering a camera rotation.

3. **Misinterpretation of Conditions**: The requirement to compute the minimum number of turns is not correctly addressed. The turns should not only consider the angle in degrees but also how many 90-degree turns yield the least deviation from "true up" in both clockwise and counter-clockwise scenarios.

### Example Analysis:
- For `x = 60`, the angle is 60 degrees counter-clockwise. The correct minimum number of 90-degree turns is 3, as described in the problem statement. The current logic only considers the clockwise rotations required to return to the original state, which would incorrectly yield a lower number.
- For `x = -60`, the logic again fails to return the correct number of turns, leading to incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not adequately fulfill the requirements of the problem description and does not compute the necessary rotations to minimize deviation from vertical correctly.

Correctness: **False**
