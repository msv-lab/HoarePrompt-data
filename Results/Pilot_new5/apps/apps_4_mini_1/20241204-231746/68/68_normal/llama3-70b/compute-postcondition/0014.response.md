The code simply executes a print statement which outputs a single character string `'?'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged and are still within the defined constraints. No calculations or assignments have been performed on these variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x` <= `y + z`). The value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y` (i.e., `x` >= `y`). The value of `x` is not equal to `y` (i.e., `x` != `y`). The output is '?'**
