The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. All three parameters are integers with the constraint that they must satisfy 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided details, so we cannot determine the specific return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, each constrained between 0 and 100.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters x, y, and z, all of which are integers constrained between 0 and 100.**
