Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` <= `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the function continues with the current values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the function prints '0' if `z` is 0; if `z` is greater than 0, it checks `x <= y + z` and `x >= y`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the function outputs '?' given that `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and still satisfies `x <= y + z`.***
