The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The initial state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect that `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, while maintaining the constraints on the other variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
