Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, meaning `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `x`.***
