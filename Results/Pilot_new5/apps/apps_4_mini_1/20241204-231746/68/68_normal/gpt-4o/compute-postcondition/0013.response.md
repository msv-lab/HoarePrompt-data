Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers in the range 0 to 100. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, then it is established that the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
