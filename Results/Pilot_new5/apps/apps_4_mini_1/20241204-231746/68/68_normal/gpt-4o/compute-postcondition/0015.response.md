Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, where each integer is within the range of 0 to 100. It then checks the relationships between calculated maximum and minimum upvotes and downvotes. If the maximum possible upvotes (`x + z`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`y`), it prints `'-'`. If the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`x`), it prints `'+'`. If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`. The function does not return any value. **
