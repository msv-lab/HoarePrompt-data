The statement `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` assigns the maximum value between the current value of `max_erase` and the result of the expression `j - i - 1` to `max_erase`. Given the initial conditions: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`, we can determine the value of `j - i - 1`.

Since `j` is at least `i + 2`, we can substitute the smallest possible value of `j`: 
- When `j = i + 2`, then `j - i - 1 = (i + 2) - i - 1 = 1`.

Thus, the value of `j - i - 1` will always be at least 1 given the constraints on `j` and `i`. The variable `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and at least 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and at least 1.**
