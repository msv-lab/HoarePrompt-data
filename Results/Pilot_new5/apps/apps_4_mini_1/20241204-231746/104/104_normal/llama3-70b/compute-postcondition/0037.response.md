Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`. If the condition holds that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. Otherwise, no updates are made to `max_erase`.***
