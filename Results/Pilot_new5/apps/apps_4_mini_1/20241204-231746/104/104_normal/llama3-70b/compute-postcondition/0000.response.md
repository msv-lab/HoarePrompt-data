`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints for `n` remain valid. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `n` is an input integer.**
