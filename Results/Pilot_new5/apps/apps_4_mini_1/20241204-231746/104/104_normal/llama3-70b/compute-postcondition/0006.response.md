The line of code updates the variable `max_erase` to the maximum value between its current value and the result of the expression `j - i - 1`. Given that `max_erase` starts at 0, we need to evaluate `j - i - 1`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the calculation results in:

```
j - i - 1 = 1 - 0 - 1 = 0
```

Now we find the maximum between `max_erase` (which is 0) and the calculated value (which is also 0). Thus, `max_erase` remains 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**
