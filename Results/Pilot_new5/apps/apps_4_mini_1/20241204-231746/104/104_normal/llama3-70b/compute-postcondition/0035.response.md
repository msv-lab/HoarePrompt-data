According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value for `j` will be `j + 1`. For the loop to run, `j` must still satisfy the condition that it is less than or equal to `n`. 

If `j` is currently at its maximum valid value, which is `n`, then `j + 1` would be `n + 1`, which exceeds the upper limit for the loop. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1` (which is the next value of `j`).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`, and `j` must be less than or equal to `n`**.
