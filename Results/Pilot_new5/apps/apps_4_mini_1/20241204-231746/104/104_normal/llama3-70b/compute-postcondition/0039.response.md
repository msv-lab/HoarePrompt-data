Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is the maximum number of erasable elements from any valid subarray within the list `a`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is not used after the loop has finished.**
