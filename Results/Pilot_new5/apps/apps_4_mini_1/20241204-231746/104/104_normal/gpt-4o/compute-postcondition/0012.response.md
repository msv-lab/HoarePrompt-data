Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a sorted list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the list `a` (minus 1), and prints this maximum gap. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 1, as there would be no gaps to compute, leading to an output of 0 in such cases. Therefore, if `n` is 1, the function will simply output 0. **
