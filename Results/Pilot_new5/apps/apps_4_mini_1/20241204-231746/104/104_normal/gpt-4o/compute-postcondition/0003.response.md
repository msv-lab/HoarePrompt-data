According to the code, the loop will execute for the range starting from 1 to `n-1`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, as the range is exclusive of the upper bound. Additionally, the index `i` will start from 1 during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, if `n` equals 1, the loop will not execute since the range would be `range(1, 1)`, which is empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to run.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `n` must be at least 2
- `i` is now 1

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0**
