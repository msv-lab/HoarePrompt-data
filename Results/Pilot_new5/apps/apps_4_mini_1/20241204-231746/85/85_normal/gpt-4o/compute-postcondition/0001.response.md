The variable `max_9s` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the execution of the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with the value from user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `max_9s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with the value from user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0.**
