`n` is assigned the value of `n // 10`. The initial value of `n` is 9, so after this operation, `n` becomes `9 // 10`, which is 0. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `max_9s` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 3**
