The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a predefined integer `n`, which is constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Since no output details are provided, we cannot specify what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate on a predefined integer `n` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a predefined integer n, constrained such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
