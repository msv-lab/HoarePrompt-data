According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the calculated upper limit `n // 2 + 1`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current iteration value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n // 2`. Since we know that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n // 2` would range from 2 to 500,000,000.

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must now be less than or equal to `n // 2`, which means that the value of `i` after increment needs to satisfy the condition `i + 1 <= n // 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is the incremented value of `i` (i + 1), and it must be less than or equal to `n // 2`**
