Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and counts how many integers `i` in the range from 1 to n/2 satisfy the condition that the sum of `i` and (n - i) is divisible by the highest place value of that sum. It then prints the count `ans`. The function does not return any value. **
