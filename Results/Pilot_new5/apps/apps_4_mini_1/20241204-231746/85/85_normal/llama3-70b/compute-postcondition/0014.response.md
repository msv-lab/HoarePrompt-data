The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not have any output specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range, but the return value is not defined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The return value is not specified.**
