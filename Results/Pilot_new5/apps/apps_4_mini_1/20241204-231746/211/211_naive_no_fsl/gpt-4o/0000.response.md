Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for splitting the array into non-zero sum subarrays is flawed. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```
In this case, the total sum of the array is `0`, but the elements can be partitioned into subarrays with non-zero sums. The program would output "NO", which is incorrect according to the problem description, since it's possible to split it into subarrays like:
- Subarray 1: elements from index 1 to 1 (sum = 1)
- Subarray 2: elements from index 2 to 2 (sum = -1)
- Subarray 3: elements from index 3 to 3 (sum = 1)
- Subarray 4: elements from index 4 to 4 (sum = -1)

The program only checks if the total sum is zero to determine if it's possible to split the array, but it does not consider that even when the total sum is zero, there can still be valid non-zero sum subarrays. Thus, the implementation is incorrect. 

There are other cases as well where the program fails to provide valid partitions correctly. Thus, the overall correctness of the implementation is false.
