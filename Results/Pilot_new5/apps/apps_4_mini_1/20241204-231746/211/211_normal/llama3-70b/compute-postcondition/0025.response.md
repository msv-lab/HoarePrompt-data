After executing the code `l = r`, the variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is 2. The other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as there are no operations affecting them in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 2, `k` is increased by 1, `l` is 2.**
