The code snippet provided executes a print statement, which outputs the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. The value of `n` does not change and is not directly involved in the print statement. The variables `k` and `l` remain unchanged, and `r` is a constant value of 3.

Therefore, the output state remains focused on the unchanged variables and their values:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `r` is 3; `k` and `l` remain unchanged.**
