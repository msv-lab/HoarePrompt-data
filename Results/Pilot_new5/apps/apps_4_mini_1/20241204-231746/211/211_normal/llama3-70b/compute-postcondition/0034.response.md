Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, with `prefix_sum[i + 1]` equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of list `a` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` is the count of values of `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last value of `r` for which this condition was true, and the output is printed as `k`, `l`, `n`.***
