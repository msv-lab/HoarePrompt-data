The value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means we are updating `prefix_sum[1]` to be equal to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`. Since `prefix_sum[0]` is initialized to 0, the value of `prefix_sum[1]` will be equal to `a[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0.**
