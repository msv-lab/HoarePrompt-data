To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code. 

### Problem Description:
The task is to split an array into several parts such that the sum of each part is not zero. If it's not possible to perform such a split, we should return "NO". If it is possible, we should return "YES" followed by the number of parts and the ranges of indices for each part.

### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
1. Reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
2. It computes the prefix sums of the array.
3. It checks if the total sum (last prefix sum) is zero:
   - If it is, it prints "NO".
   - If it is not, it prints "YES" and then attempts to construct the parts based on non-zero prefix sums.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the array consists entirely of zeros (e.g., `0, 0, 0`), the total sum will be zero, and thus the program will correctly return "NO".
2. If the total sum is non-zero but the prefix sums are zero at some point (e.g., `1, -1, 0`), the program might incorrectly assume that it can create a partition.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that the function counts non-zero prefix sums and checks their conditions. However, it mentions that if all elements of the list are zero, it could lead to an ambiguous situation. 

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not handle cases where the prefix sum becomes zero at some point during the array traversal but the total sum is non-zero. This could lead to partitions that do not satisfy the problem's requirements.
2. The logic for determining ranges based on `prefix_sum[r] != 0` is valid, but it might not correctly conclude the parts if there are consecutive sums leading to ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly as described. An example case where it would fail is:
- For the input `3, 1, -1, 0`, it would end up printing "YES" but would not split the array in a way that each part has a non-zero sum.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
