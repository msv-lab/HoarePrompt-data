The `print` statement outputs the current values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `n` are unchanged by the print operation itself; however, we can infer that they will be printed as they are.

- `k` is the count of values of `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, which could be any positive integer based on the provided conditions. If the condition is never met, `k` remains 1.
- `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition was met, or 1 if the condition was never met.
- `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.

Since `print` does not modify any variables, the output state remains as it is, with `k`, `l`, and `n` retaining their values.

Output State: **`k` is the count of values of `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition was met, `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; Output is printed: k, l, n**
