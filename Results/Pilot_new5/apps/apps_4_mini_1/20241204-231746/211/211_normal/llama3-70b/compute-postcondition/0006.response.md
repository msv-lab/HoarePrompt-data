To analyze the code snippet provided, we start with the initial state. The variable `prefix_sum` is a list that holds cumulative sums of the list `a`. The variable `i` is currently 1.

The code modifies the `prefix_sum` list at index `i + 1`, which is 2. The new value for `prefix_sum[2]` will be the sum of `prefix_sum[1]` (which is `a[0]`) and `prefix_sum[1]` itself.

Let's summarize the impact of the code:
- The value of `prefix_sum[2]` is updated to `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`.

Given that `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, the new value of `prefix_sum[2]` will be `a[0] + a[1]`.

Thus, the updated state of the variables will be:
- `prefix_sum[2]` is assigned the value `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`, which simplifies to `a[0] + a[1]`.

The output will reflect that `prefix_sum` now contains the updated values, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 1**.
