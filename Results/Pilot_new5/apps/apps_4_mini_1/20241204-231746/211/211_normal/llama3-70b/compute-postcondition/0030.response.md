The value of `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is currently 3. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `r` is 3; `k` is increased by 1, but its previous value is not specified and remains irrelevant for this operation; `l` remains unchanged prior to the assignment. After executing the code, `l` will now have the value of `r`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `r` is 3; `k` is increased by 1; `l` is 3.**
