The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates the prefix sums of the list and checks if the total sum of the list is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and counts the number of non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum, printing the count and the last indices where this condition holds, followed by `n`. If all elements of the list are zero, it could lead to an ambiguous situation where no valid output is generated for the prefix sums, as the conditions depend on the existence of non-zero sums.
