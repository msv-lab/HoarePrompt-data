The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, 'YES' is printed to the output, and output is '2 n' where n is the current value of n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
