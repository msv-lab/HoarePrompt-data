The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `A`, which is a list of `n` integers. Each integer `a_i` in the list `A` satisfies the condition -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. 

The function does not have any specific output cases described, so we cannot infer any return values based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list A of n integers, where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
