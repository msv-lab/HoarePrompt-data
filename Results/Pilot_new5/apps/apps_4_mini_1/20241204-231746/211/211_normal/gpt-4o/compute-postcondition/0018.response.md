The code snippet executes a `print` statement that outputs the value `2`. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the initial state. Since the output is a direct print action without any variable assignments or modifications, the initial conditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, and 'YES' is printed.**
