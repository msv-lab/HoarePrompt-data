To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the key requirements:

1. We need to split the array A into several parts such that the sum of each part is not zero.
2. If it is impossible to split the array such that all parts meet the condition, the output should be "NO".
3. If it is possible, the output should begin with "YES", followed by the number of parts and the indices of each part.

Let's examine the given program logic step-by-step:

- The program first checks if the total sum of the array is not equal to zero. If this condition holds, it outputs "YES" and states there's only one part that encompasses the whole array.
- If the total sum is zero, the program iterates through the array to find any non-zero element. If it finds one, it splits the array into two parts: one containing the elements up to and including the first non-zero element, and the other containing the rest of the array.
- If all elements are zero, it outputs "NO".

### Testing for Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Single Non-Zero Element**: If the input is `1` followed by `5`, the output should be "YES" and the index `1 1` should be printed, which is handled correctly.
  
2. **All Zeros**: If the input is `3` followed by `0 0 0`, it correctly outputs "NO".

3. **Mixed Zeros and Non-Zeros**: Consider the input `4` followed by `0 2 -2 0`. The total sum is `0`, and there is a non-zero (2). The program should split as:
   - First part: `0 2` (indices `1 2`)
   - Second part: `-2 0` (indices `3 4`)
   However, the program only finds the first non-zero and will not treat `-2` properly since it does not check if the second part is also valid (it sums to `-2`).

4. **All Non-Zero**: If the input is `3` followed by `1 -2 1`, the sum is `0`, but there are valid splits possible that won't sum to zero, which the program fails to identify since it only splits at the first non-zero.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to account for cases where the total sum is zero, but it can still create valid subarrays by splitting at other indices. The logic does not guarantee that all parts will have non-zero sums in every case. Thus, it does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
