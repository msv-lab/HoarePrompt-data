According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts iterating with `j` initialized to `i + 2`, and it continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given the current values, `i` is less than `n - 2`, which means `i + 2` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`. Since the loop continues while `j` is less than `n`, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be `i + 3`.

Since `i` is less than `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one additional time, `n` must still be greater than `i + 3` (because `j` must be less than `n`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`**
