The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `left` is at least 0 (as it can be any integer), so after the increment, `left` will be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `right`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 1, `right` must be greater than 0**
