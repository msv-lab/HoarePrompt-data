The value of `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`. The previous value of `max_beauty` is not specified, but it remains unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `curr_beauty`. If `curr_beauty` is greater, `max_beauty` takes that value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is an input string; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`; `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`; `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop; `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`; `right` is equal to `n`.**
