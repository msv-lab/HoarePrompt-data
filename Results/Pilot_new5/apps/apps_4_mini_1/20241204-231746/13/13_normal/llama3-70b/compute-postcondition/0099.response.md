According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as the variable `j` is decremented down to -1 from `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented to `i - 2`. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\), there's no change to `n`, and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `max_beauty` depend on the state of string `s` and the characters encountered during the loop. 

Since `j` is now set to `i - 2`, we need to ensure that the character at `s[j]` is evaluated next. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `beauty` is 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` remains equal to `n`, `j` is `i - 2`**
