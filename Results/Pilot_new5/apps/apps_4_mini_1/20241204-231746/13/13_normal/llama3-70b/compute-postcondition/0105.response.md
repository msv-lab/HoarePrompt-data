The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is -1, `beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains equal to `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
