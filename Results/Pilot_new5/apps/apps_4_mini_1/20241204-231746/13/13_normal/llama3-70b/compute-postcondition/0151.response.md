Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `i` is less than `n - 3`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement while maintaining the condition that `n` is within the specified range and `i` remains less than `n - 3.***
