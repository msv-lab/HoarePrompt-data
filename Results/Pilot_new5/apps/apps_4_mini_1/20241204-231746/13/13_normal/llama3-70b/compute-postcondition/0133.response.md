According to the code, the loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `j` by 1 each time. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be greater than or equal to `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, and since the loop runs from `i - 1`, `j` must be at least `0` for the loop to execute one more time. This implies that the value of `i` must be greater than `0` at the start of the next iteration for the loop to continue.

If `j` is currently `i - 1`, it will decrement to `i - 2` for the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `1`, allowing `j` to start at `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, and `i` must be greater than 1**.
