The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `j`, `max_beauty`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The previous value of `beauty` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is `i - 2`, `max_beauty` may be updated as previously stated, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is increased by 1.
