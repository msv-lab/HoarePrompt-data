To determine the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the provided loop and the state variables at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop structure indicates that `j` starts at `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches `0` (inclusive). The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that the loop variable `j` must be decremented for the next iteration. Thus, if `j` was at a certain index during the last iteration, it will be one index lower in the next iteration.

3. Also, we note that the loop will terminate when `j` becomes less than `0`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be at least `0` at the end of the last iteration.

4. The values of the other state variables (`n`, `beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `left`, `right`, etc.) may also need to be accounted for, but the main variable that determines the ability to continue iterating in the for loop is `j`.

From this information, we conclude that during the last iteration, `j` must have been `0` for the loop to have executed. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be `-1` and the loop will not execute again since `j` cannot be decremented below `0`.

Thus, the states can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is -1, `beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains equal to `n`**
