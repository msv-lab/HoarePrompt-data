The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged based on the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3, `beauty` is increased by 1**.
