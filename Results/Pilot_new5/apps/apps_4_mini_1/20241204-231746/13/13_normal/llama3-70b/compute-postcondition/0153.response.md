`beauty` is incremented by 1. The conditions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3`, and `j` is `i + 3`, ensuring `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
