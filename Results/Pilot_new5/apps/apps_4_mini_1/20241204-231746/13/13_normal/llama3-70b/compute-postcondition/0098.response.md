Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `beauty` is updated to 2, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, `curr_beauty` remains the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `beauty` is 1, and `s[j]` is not 'G', breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, and `right` remains equal to `n`.***
