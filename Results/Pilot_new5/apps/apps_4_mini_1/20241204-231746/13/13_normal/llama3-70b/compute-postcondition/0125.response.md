According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is the index for the loop, if the last iteration was with `i` equal to `n - 2`, then in the next iteration, `i` would be incremented to `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` would have been `n - 2` (the highest value within the range), allowing the loop to execute again when `i` is incremented to `n - 1`. However, at this point, the loop will not run since `i` is equal to `n - 1`, which is outside the range.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop's current index `i` would need to be less than `n - 1`. Hence, `i` must be set to `n - 1`, and for the loop to be valid, `n` remains within the specified bounds.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` remain unchanged.**
