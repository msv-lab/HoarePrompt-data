The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `left` is less than `right`, the constraint that `left` must remain less than `right` is still valid after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left`; `golden` must be empty or must not include indices less than `right`; `left` is now `left + 1`, and `left` is still less than `right`.
