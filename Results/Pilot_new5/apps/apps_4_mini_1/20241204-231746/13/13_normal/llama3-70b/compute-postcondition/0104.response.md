`beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `j`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is -1, `beauty` is increased by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains equal to `n`.**
