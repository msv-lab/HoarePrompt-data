`beauty` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is `n - 1`; `beauty` is 1; `curr_beauty` remains unchanged; `max_beauty` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is `n - 1`; `beauty` is 1; `curr_beauty` remains unchanged; `max_beauty` remains unchanged.**
