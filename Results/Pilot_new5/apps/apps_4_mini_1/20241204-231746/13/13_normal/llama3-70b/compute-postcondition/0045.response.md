The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy the condition of being an integer within the range of 2 to 100000. The condition regarding `s` remains valid, as the code does not affect the string `s` or the indexing on it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G' after increment; `left` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G' after increment; `left` is incremented by 1.**
