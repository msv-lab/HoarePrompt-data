Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable by swapping one 'G' with an adjacent 'S', `max_beauty` is the maximum beauty calculated throughout the iterations of the loop, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop execution, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, and `golden` remains a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`. If the loop does not execute, then `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0 and all other variables retain their original values.**
