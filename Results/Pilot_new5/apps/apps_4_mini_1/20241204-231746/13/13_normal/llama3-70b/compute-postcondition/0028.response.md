The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 0, so the new value will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected and retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` must not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1.
