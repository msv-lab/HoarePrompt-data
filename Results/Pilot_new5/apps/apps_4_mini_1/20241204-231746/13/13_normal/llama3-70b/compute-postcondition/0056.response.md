To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given variables and their roles within the loop:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). This requires that `n` is at least `2`, which is already satisfied since it is stated that `2 <= n <= 100000`.

2. The loop variable `i` will start at `0` and will take on values up to `n - 2`. Therefore, before the loop begins, `i` must be initialized to `0`, as it will be the first value used in the iteration.

3. The loop body (which is omitted) may rely on other variables, but we can assert that the loop will execute as long as `n` is not less than `2`.

4. Since `n` is already stated to be within the proper bounds, we do not need to make any adjustments to `n`. 

Given these points, hereâ€™s the finalized state that incorporates the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0**.
