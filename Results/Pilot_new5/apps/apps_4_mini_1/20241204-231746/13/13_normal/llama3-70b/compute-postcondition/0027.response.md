According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`. Right before the loop, `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so the condition `left < right` is satisfied. 

However, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to check the value of `s[left]`. Since `left` is currently 0, we need `s[0]` not to be equal to 'G' for the loop to proceed. 

As the state indicates `s` is an input string, we cannot change it directly, but we can ensure that `s[0]` is not 'G'. Thus, we need the condition that `s[left]` must be different from 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` must not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 1**
