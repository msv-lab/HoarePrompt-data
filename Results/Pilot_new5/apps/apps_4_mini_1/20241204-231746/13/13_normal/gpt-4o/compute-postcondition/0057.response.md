The code assigns values to `prev_start` and `prev_end` by unpacking the tuple at index `i - 1` of the `segments` list. Since `i` is 2, it accesses `segments[1]`. To determine the new values of `prev_start` and `prev_end`, we need to consider the contents of `segments`. The variable `segments` must contain at least 3 tuples, so `segments[1]` is guaranteed to exist.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `segments` contains at least 3 tuples; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[1]`.**
