Output State: **`i` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from the original index `start` up to the first 'S' encountered or `n` if no 'S' is present, `trophies[i]` is 'S' or out of bounds (if `i` equals `n`), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', and `segments` remains an empty list.**
