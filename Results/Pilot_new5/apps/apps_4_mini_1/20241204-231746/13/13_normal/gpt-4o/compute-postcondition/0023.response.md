The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which implies that after the increment, `n` is still greater than the new value of `i + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new `i + 1`, where `i` has been incremented by 1.**
