The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\). The parameter `trophies` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'G' and 'S'. 

After executing the function body, the function has three possible return cases:

- Case 1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns 0, indicating that there is no additional value or calculation to perform.
  
- Case 2: If other conditions are met, it returns the maximum length of segments calculated from 'segments', which contains tuples representing at least one segment of consecutive 'G' characters.

- Case 3: If yet another condition is satisfied, the function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length calculated during the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and based on specific conditions, it returns either 0, the maximum length of segments of 'G', or the minimum value between `(max_length + 1)` and `n`.
