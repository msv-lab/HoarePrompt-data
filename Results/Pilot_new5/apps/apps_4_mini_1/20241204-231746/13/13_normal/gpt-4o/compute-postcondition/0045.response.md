Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of at least one segment of consecutive 'G' characters in the original string `trophies`. The original value of `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'.***
