Postcondition: ***`i` is 2; `segments` contains at least 3 tuples; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the values from `segments[1]`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the values from `segments[2]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the calculated length given by `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.***
