In the code snippet provided, `dp[i + a]` is being updated by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 2, this means we are modifying the value of `dp[2 + a]`, which translates to `dp[a + 2]`.

Since `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000, `a + 2` will be a value between 3 and 100,002. The value of `dp[i]` will be added to the value at `dp[a + 2]`. 

However, we do not have the original value of `dp[i]` or `dp[a + 2]`, so we cannot specify the exact new value of `dp[a + 2]`. Still, we can state that `dp[a + 2]` is updated by adding the current value of `dp[i]` to it.

The output state should therefore reflect the changes made by the operation, while retaining all other variables' states.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `i` is 2, `dp[a + 2]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it.**
