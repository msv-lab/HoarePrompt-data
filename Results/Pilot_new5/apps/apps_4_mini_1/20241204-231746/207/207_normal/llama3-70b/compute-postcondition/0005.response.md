The operation `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding the current value of `dp[i]` to it. The variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged in this context. The only affected variable is `dp[i + a]`, which now includes the value of `dp[i]`.

Since `i` is currently 0, `dp[i]` is equivalent to `dp[0]`, and thus `dp[i + a]` becomes `dp[a]`. 

The initial states that are still valid after execution are:
- `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9.
- `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5.
- `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5.
- `i` is now 0.
- The current value of `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `i` is now 0, and `dp[a]` is now equal to `dp[a] + dp[0]`.**
