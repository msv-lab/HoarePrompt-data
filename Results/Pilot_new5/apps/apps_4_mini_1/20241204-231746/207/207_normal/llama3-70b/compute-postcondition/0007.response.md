Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and `i` is 0. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is updated to `dp[a] + dp[0]`. The current value of `i` is 0, and it holds that `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `b` is less than or equal to 0.***
