The function accepts three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. It calculates the number of ways to reach a total of `m` using increments of `a` and decrements of `b`, and returns the sum of all valid combinations stored in the `dp` list. However, due to the constraint on `m`, the function may run into performance issues or memory limitations when `m` is large, as it tries to create a list of size `m + 1`.
