#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer, and y is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Therefore, the GCD is the value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x`. It correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the value of func_2 with parameters m // g, a // g, b // g, multiplied by g, where g is a value returned by func_1(a, b) and is not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer less than k, which is equal to a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of k * (k + 1) // 2 and m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2, where k is equal to a + b - 1, sum_k is k * (k + 1) // 2, and sum_m is m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It first calculates a value `g` from `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with `m` divided by `g`, `a` divided by `g`, and `b` divided by `g`, then multiplies the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m` integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it returns the sum of the first `k` integers plus the adjusted sum of the first `m` integers minus the sum of the first `k - 1` integers. The function handles various cases based on the relationships between `m`, `a`, and `b`, and performs calculations accordingly.
