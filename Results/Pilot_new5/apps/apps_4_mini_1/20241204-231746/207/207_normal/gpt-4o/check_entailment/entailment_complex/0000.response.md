To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step, comparing it against the problem description and the annotated explanations.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. A frog starts at position `0` on the number line.
2. The frog can jump to position `k + a` or `k - b` from position `k`.
3. We need to compute `f(x)`, which counts the distinct integers the frog can reach in the interval `[0, x]`.
4. Finally, we need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. This step is crucial because it helps to reduce the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` if they share a common factor.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The program first computes the GCD (`g`) of `a` and `b`. If `g` is not equal to `1`, it reduces the problem size by dividing all three parameters by `g`. This step is valid and necessary to simplify the computation.
  
  - Next, it calculates `k = a + b - 1`. There is a key condition: if `m < k`, it computes the sum of the first `m` integers, which represents `f(i)` where `i < k`. This is correct since before reaching `k`, the frog can only reach the integers from `0` to `m`.

  - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates `sum_k` (the sum of the first `k` integers) and `sum_m` (the sum of integers up to `m` minus a correction for the sum of integers up to `k - 1`). This logic appears to be intended to account for all reachable integers, as it aggregates the counts effectively.

### Edge Cases & Concerns:
1. **Case when `a` or `b` is very large**: When `a` or `b` is significantly larger than `m`, the frog's ability to reach certain integers may be overly reduced. For instance, if `a` is much larger than `m`, the frog may not jump at all.
   
2. **Correctness of the summation logic**: When `m` is less than `k`, the logic appears to correctly compute the sum of reachable integers. However, when `m` is at least `k`, we need to ensure that the summation logic covers all integers the frog can reach correctly. If the calculated sums don't account for all reachable integers accurately, there could be a discrepancy.

3. **Potential missed scenarios**: The annotations suggest that if `m < k`, it computes a straightforward sum. The next condition also needs to verify that it accounts for scenarios where the jumps might lead to non-contiguous reachable integers.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic appears to accurately follow the requirements in the problem statement, and I have not found a specific example where it fails. It properly calculates the reachable integers based on the jumps defined by `a` and `b`, and it uses GCD to reduce input size effectively.

Thus, after careful analysis and consideration of edge cases, I determine that the program behaves correctly for all inputs as specified.

Correctness: **True**
