The value of `k` is assigned the result of `a + b - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100,000. Therefore, `k` will be a positive integer that is equal to `a + b - 1`. The states of the other variables (`m` and `g`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
