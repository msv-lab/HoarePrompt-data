The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` assigns new values to `cov`, `x`, and `y` from the popped element of the heap. The previous values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` will be replaced by the new values taken from the heap. The other variables retain their previous states. Since `cov`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values from the heap, we can't specify their final values without knowing the contents of the heap. However, we know `cov` will be updated and since `total_coverage` is defined as `-2 * cov`, that will also change as a result of the new value of `cov`.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 1, loop counter is 2, `cov` is the new value from the heap, `x` is the new value from the heap, `y` is the new value from the heap, `total_coverage` is -2 * `cov`.**
