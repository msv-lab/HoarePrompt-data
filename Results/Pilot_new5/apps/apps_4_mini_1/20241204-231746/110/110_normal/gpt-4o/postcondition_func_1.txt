Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing coordinates, and calculates the area of a rectangle defined by these coordinates and a radius `r`, constrained within the bounds of a pond of dimensions `n` by `m`. The function returns the area, which can potentially be negative if the calculated bounds are invalid; however, the area will default to zero if the rectangle defined by coordinates and radius does not have a valid positive area.
