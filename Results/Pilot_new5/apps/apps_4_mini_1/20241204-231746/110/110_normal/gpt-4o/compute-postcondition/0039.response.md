The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the pond, `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond. After executing the function body, it calculates the total coverage as the negative sum of the first `k` cov values from the heap, and the total positions as equal to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The function then returns the total coverage divided by the total positions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform a calculation based on the dimensions of the pond, the scoop-net size, and the number of fishes, returning a ratio of total coverage to total positions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (dimensions of the pond), r (size of the scoop-net), and k (number of distinct fishes), returns the total coverage divided by the total positions.**
