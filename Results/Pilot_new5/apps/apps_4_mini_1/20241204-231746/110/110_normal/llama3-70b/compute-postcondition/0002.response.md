`ans` is calculated as `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, which is a non-negative integer based on the provided conditions. The expression `((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` represents the total number of cells left after excluding rows and columns from `r`. The output of the print statement will be `ans` divided by this total. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, and the result of the division.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n·m`, 10^5); `ans` is equal to min(`k`, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)); print outputs `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.**
