To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the variables involved.

1. `k`, `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers defined in the initial state. The value of `k` is limited such that `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)`. The values of `n` and `m` are both between 1 and 100,000, and `r` is between 1 and the minimum of `n` and `m`.

2. The code `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` calculates the value of `ans` based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `r`:
   - The expression `(n - r + 1)` calculates how many rows are available after subtracting `r` from `n` and adding one back.
   - Similarly, `(m - r + 1)` calculates the available columns after `r` is subtracted from `m`.
   - The product of these two expressions gives the total number of positions left after considering `r`.

3. Finally, `ans` is assigned the smaller value between `k` and the calculated product. 

Since we don't have specific input values for `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, we can only express the output state in terms of those variables and their relationships.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n·m`, 10^5); `ans` is equal to min(`k`, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)).**
