Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. The main issue arises in the `coverage` function.

### Issue:
1. The `coverage` function is designed to calculate the number of possible positions for the scoop that can cover the fish located at `(x, y)`. However, the calculation appears to be incorrect. Particularly, the way the boundaries are calculated can result in negative values or invalid counts, which would misrepresent the coverage of fishes in the pond.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
n = 2, m = 2, r = 2, k = 3
```
Here, the pond is a 2x2 grid, the scoop size is 2, and you want to place 3 fishes. However, it is impossible to place 3 fishes in a 2x2 grid (as there are only 4 cells). The program does not handle the case where `k` exceeds the number of available cells (which is `n * m`), leading to incorrect calculations, especially when calculating the expected number of fishes caught.

In such cases, the program should return the expected value based on the maximum number of fishes that can actually fit in the pond, which is `min(k, n * m)`, but the logic does not account for this constraint.

As a result, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential edge cases. Therefore, the response is marked as **False**.
