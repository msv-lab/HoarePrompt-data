According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `f_max_n` down to `1`. Currently, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, which means the loop has not yet executed for `j = f_max_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be decremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 2`. Additionally, since the loop needs to execute until `j` reaches `1`, the value of `f_max_n` must remain at least `2` for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo 1000000007.**
