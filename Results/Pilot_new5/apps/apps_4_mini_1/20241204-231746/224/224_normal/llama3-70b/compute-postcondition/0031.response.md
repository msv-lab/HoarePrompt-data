The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by applying the modulus operation with `MOD`, which is `1000000007`. Since the variable `dp[j]` has already been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, after applying the modulus, the value of `dp[j]` will be the result of that addition taken modulo `1000000007`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % 1000000007`.**
