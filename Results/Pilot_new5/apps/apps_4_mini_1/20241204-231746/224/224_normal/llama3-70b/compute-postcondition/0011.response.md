The variable `dp[j]` is updated to include `dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is initialized to 0, this means `dp[0]` is being updated. The previous value of `dp[0]` is 1, so `dp[0]` will remain 1 after the update. The other variable `dp[1]`, which is already stated to be updated based on prior conditions, remains unchanged. The values of `dp` for other indices stay the same as they were not modified in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is updated; `dp[1]` is `dp[1] % 1000000007`; `dp[0]` remains 1.**
