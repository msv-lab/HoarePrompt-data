The code assigns a value to `MOD`, which is a constant set to \(10^9 + 7\). This does not change any other variables or the initial state of `n` or `f_max_n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1 through n, `MOD` is 1000000007**
