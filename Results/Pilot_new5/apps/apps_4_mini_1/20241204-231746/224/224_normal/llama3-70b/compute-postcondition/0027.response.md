The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it and taking the result modulo `1000000007`. The previous value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged, while `dp[j - 1]` is known to be a certain value based on the updates made in the list. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`.**
