#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly handles the case where `b` is 0 by returning `a` as the GCD, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD. If `a` is also 0, the GCD is conventionally defined as 0. Therefore, the function can also return 0 as the result when both inputs are 0.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `res` is the maximum value obtained from the calls to `func_1` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is `n` after the last iteration.
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum value obtained from the calls to `func_1` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, calling the function `func_1` with the current maximum result and the current integer `i`. It returns the maximum value obtained from these calls to `func_1`. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise from the execution of `func_1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1 through n.

            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` has been updated such that for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is equal to the sum of all previous `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `j-1`, modulo `1000000007`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], where dp[j] is equal to the sum of all previous dp[k] for k from 0 to j-1, modulo 1000000007
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^6`) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`. It computes an array `dp` such that `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to obtain a sum of `j` using numbers from 1 to `n`, and returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of ways to achieve this sum modulo `1000000007`. The function assumes that `f_max_n` is at least 0 and does not handle cases where `f_max_n` exceeds the bounds of the computed values in `dp`.
