Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^6`) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`. It computes an array `dp` such that `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to obtain a sum of `j` using numbers from 1 to `n`, and returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of ways to achieve this sum modulo `1000000007`. The function assumes that `f_max_n` is at least 0 and does not handle cases where `f_max_n` exceeds the bounds of the computed values in `dp`. **
