According to the code, the loop will iterate from `1` to `n`, which implies that `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute. Given that the provided state specifies `n` is an integer in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. 

In this specific case, the variable `i` will start at `1` at the beginning of the loop and increase until it reaches `n`. Therefore, `i` will be initialized to `1` when the loop starts.

Since `f_max_n` has been defined in relation to the permutations of integers from `1` to `n`, it needs to be non-negative, which is already implied as it is defined as a non-negative integer.

Thus, the states that need to be noted for the loop to execute are as follows:

1. `n` is greater than or equal to `2` (as already stated).
2. `i` starts at `1` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is non-negative, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` set to 1, and `i` is 1**.
