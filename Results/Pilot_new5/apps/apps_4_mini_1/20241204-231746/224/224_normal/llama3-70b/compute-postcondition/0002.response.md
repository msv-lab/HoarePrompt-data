The variable `dp[0]` is assigned the value 1. Other variables maintain their previous values, as they are not affected by this operation. Since `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized with all values set to 0, only the first element `dp[0]` is updated. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1 through n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` is set to 1 and all other values remain 0.**
