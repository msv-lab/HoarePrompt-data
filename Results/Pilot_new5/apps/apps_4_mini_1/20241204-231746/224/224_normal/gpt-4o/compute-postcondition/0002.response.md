The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` and then taking the modulo with `mod`. The initial value of `result` is 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, `result` becomes `1 * 2 % (10^9 + 7)`, which is 2. The values of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
