According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the current state of `i` and the condition based on `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

Given that `n` must be at least 3, we can derive that `n` could be 3 or higher. If `n` is 3, then `n + 1` is 4, allowing the loop to execute one more time when `i` is 4. If `n` is greater than 3, the loop will still execute when `i` is 4.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 4, and `n` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
