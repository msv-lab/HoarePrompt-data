To determine the correctness of the given program, we first need to analyze the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to compute `f(p)` for permutations of integers from `1` to `n`.
- `f(p)` is defined as the number of distinct GCDs of the prefixes of the permutation.
- `f_max(n)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` across all permutations of the integers `1` to `n`.
- The output should be the count of permutations for which `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Observations from the Code:
1. The code checks if `n` is `2` and directly returns `1` in that case.
2. For `n` greater than `2`, the function `func_1` is called with `n-1` which calculates the factorial of `(n-1)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. The factorial function seems to imply that the program is attempting to count the permutations somehow related to the factorial of `(n-1)`.

### Key Points:
- The only case explicitly handled is for `n=2`, returning `1`, which corresponds correctly as `f_max(2)` is indeed `1` from the provided example.
- For `n>2`, the function computes `(n-1)!`, but it is unclear if this correctly relates to counting the permutations whose `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`.
- The code does not handle general cases or provide the necessary logic to determine the maximum value `f_max(n)` or how it relates to the computation of `f(p)` for each permutation.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases:
1. **For `n = 4`**: 
   - We need to determine `f_max(4)`. Manually or algorithmically checking all permutations shows that the maximum `f(p)` is `2`, and the expected count of permutations for which `f(p) = 2` is `12`.
   - However, the code calculates `func_1(3)` which equals `3! = 6`, leading to an incorrect output.

2. **For `n = 5`**:
   - Similarly, we can find that `f_max(5) = 3`, and the expected number of permutations for that is `30`. The code will compute `4! = 24`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the number of permutations for which `f(p) = f_max(n)`. It only calculates `(n-1)!`, which does not match the requirements of the problem. Therefore, it can produce incorrect outputs for various values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
