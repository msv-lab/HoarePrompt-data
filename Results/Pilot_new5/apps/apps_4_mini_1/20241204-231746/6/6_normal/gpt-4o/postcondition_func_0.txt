The function accepts four integer parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, `l` is between 1 and `n` (not equal to 1), and `r` is between `l` and `n`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to navigate from position `pos` to the specified tab range defined by `l` and `r`. If the leftmost tab (`l`) is 1 and the rightmost (`r`) is `n`, it prints 0. If only the leftmost tab is 1, it prints the distance to `r` plus one. If only the rightmost tab is `n`, it prints the distance to `l` plus one. If both `l` and `r` are within the range, it calculates the minimal movement considering moving to either `l` or `r` and the distance between them, printing the result.
