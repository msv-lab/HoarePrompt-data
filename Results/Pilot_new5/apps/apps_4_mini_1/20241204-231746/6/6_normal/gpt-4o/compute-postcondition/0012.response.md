To compute the value of `close_both_sides`, we analyze the provided state and the expression in the code snippet.

The variables involved in the computation are:
- `move_to_l` which is equal to `abs(pos - l)`
- `move_to_r` which is equal to `abs(pos - r)`

The calculation for `close_both_sides` is defined as:
```
close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
```

Given this, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. `move_to_l` is computed and is equal to `abs(pos - l)`.
2. `move_to_r` is computed and is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.
3. The values `(r - l + 2)` is a constant term added to both parts being compared by `min`.

Since `close_both_sides` is a function of `move_to_l`, `move_to_r`, `r`, and `l`, the other variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The calculation of `close_both_sides` simply creates a new value based on the existing variables without affecting them.

Therefore, the Output State will include the unchanged variables and the newly calculated `close_both_sides`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.**
