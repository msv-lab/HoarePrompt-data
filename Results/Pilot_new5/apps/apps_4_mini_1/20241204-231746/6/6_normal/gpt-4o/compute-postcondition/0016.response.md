Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l` is 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the printed output is 0. Otherwise, if `l` is 1, the printed value is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the printed value is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition holds, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which is printed.***
