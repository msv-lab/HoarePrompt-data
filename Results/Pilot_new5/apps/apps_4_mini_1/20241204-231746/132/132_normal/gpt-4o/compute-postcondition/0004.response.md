The code assigns the value of `total_y` to be the sum of the elements in the list `y`. The previous state gives us that `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, thus `total_y` will be a non-negative integer as well. The value of `total_y` is now equal to `sum(y)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to `sum(x)`; `total_y` is equal to `sum(y)`.**
