The function accepts a positive integer `n`, reads two lists of `n` non-negative integers from user input, calculates the sums of these lists (`total_x` for list `x` and `total_y` for list `y`), and prints 'No' if `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, or 'Yes' otherwise. It does not return any values. The function relies on user input and does not handle edge cases where the input is invalid or does not meet the specified constraints.
