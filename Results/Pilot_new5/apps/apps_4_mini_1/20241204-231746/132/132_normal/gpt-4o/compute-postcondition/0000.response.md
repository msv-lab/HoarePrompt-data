The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Given that `n` is initially a positive integer in the range 1 to 50, it will retain this property. The states of the other variables `x` and `y` are not affected by this specific line of code, but the value of `n` will now be determined by user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of n integers where each integer x_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of n integers where each integer y_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000; `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.**
