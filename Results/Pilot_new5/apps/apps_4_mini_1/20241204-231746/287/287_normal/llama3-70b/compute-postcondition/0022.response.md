The function `func` accepts an implicit positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), which is read from user input. It calculates the total number of divisors of `n`. The result `res` is initialized to zero and is incremented by 2 for every divisor found (one for the divisor itself and one for its corresponding pair). If `n` is a perfect square, it decrements `res` by 1 to account for the duplicate counting of the square root. The function then prints the total number of divisors to the console.

The functionality of the function does not include explicit return statements; rather, it outputs the result directly. There are no additional edge cases mentioned, but the handling of perfect squares is important to note. The function does not handle invalid or unexpected input scenarios (like non-integer values) as it assumes the input will always satisfy the constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input and prints the total number of divisors of `n`, adjusting for perfect squares by decrementing the count if necessary. **
