The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The initial state does not specify the value of `res`, so it remains valid but unspecified. The other variable `n` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least `(i + 1)`; `res` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least `(i + 1)`; `res` is increased by 2.**
