The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` can either be 3 or greater than 3, so the new value of `count` will be either 4 or greater than 4, respectively. The value of `num` and the condition related to `num` remains unchanged. The state of `i` has been incremented by 1 but that is not directly affected by the `count` increment. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 4 or greater than 4, `i` is incremented by 1**
