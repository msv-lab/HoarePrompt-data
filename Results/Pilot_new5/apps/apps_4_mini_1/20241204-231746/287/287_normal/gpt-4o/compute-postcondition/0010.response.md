According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. The loop will execute again as long as the condition `i * i <= num` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` has been incremented by 1. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `num`. Since `i` has been incremented, we must ensure that the new value of `i` squared does not exceed `num`. 

Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `i` before incrementing as `i_prev`. After incrementing, we have `i = i_prev + 1`. The condition for the loop to execute one more time would then be:

\[
(i\_prev + 1) * (i\_prev + 1) \leq num
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
i\_prev^2 + 2 * i\_prev + 1 \leq num
\]

Since we know `num` is at least 4, we need to ensure that `num` is sufficiently greater than `i_prev^2 + 2 * i_prev`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `num` is at least equal to `i_prev^2 + 2 * i_prev + 1`, which would ensure that the condition still holds after the increment.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num`. Specifically, we can express this requirement in terms of the currently known variables.

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 2 or greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
