The provided Python program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a number \( n \). A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to \( n \), and the weight of a split is the number of times the first element appears in that split.

2. **Program Functionality**: The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the total number of divisors of the integer `num`. The process of finding divisors does not relate to splits or weights as defined in the problem description. 

3. **Mismatch**: 
   - The output of the `func_1` function (the count of divisors) does not correspond to the number of different weights of the splits of \( n \).
   - The logic to calculate the number of splits and their respective weights is missing entirely. The program only counts the divisors of the input number, which is unrelated to the required calculation.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
