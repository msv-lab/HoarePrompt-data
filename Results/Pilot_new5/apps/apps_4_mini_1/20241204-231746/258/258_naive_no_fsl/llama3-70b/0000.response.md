Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a key issue in its approach to finding the optimal position for the heat source. Specifically, it uses a brute-force method by iterating over integer coordinates in the range of `-1000` to `1000` for both X and Y. While this may work for many cases, it does not guarantee finding the optimal position for the heat source in cases where the optimal location is not at an integer coordinate.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```
The optimal position derived from the sample is at `(-0.2, 0)`, which is not an integer coordinate. The program, however, only tests integer coordinates and thus would miss this optimal solution, potentially returning an incorrect minimum grilling time for the K pieces of meat.

Moreover, the logic inside `func_3` does not ensure that the optimal point is found, as the minimum time is only calculated based on discrete integer points. This can lead to situations where the solution is not approached closely enough, resulting in an incorrect or suboptimal answer.

Thus, the overall approach does not fulfill the requirement of minimizing the grilling time accurately, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
