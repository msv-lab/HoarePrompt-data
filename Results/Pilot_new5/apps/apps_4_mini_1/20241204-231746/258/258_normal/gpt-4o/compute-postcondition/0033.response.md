The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T` and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
