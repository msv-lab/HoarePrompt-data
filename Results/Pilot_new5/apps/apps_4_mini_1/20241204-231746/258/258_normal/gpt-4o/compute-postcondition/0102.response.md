The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the code does not modify any variables, but it causes the program to ignore any subsequent code within the loop for the current iteration. 

Since `my` remains updated based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `count` is still the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `count` is still less than `K`, and `N` is still greater than `i + 1`, all previous states remain valid.

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `count` remains less than `K`, and `N` is greater than `i + 1; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
