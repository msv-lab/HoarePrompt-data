The code `continue` does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the current iteration and continue to the next iteration of the loop it is inside. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, but the execution flow moves to the next iteration.

Output State: **`my` remains equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated such that `x1` is assigned the value of `x2`, `y1` is assigned the value of `y2`, `c1` is assigned the value of `c2`, `x2` is assigned the value of `x1`, `y2` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `c2` is assigned the value of `c1`; `d` is now equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
