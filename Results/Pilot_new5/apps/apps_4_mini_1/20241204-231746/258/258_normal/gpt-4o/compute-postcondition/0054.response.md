The code `continue` does not change any variable values but affects the control flow of the program by skipping the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. As a result, the variables retain their previous values but do not proceed with any further code within that iteration.

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `(c1 - c2) * T` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
