Postcondition: ***`my` remains equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated such that `x1` is assigned the value of `x2`, `y1` is assigned the value of `y2`, `c1` is assigned the value of `c2`, `x2` is assigned the value of `x1`, `y2` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `c2` is assigned the value of `c1` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.***
