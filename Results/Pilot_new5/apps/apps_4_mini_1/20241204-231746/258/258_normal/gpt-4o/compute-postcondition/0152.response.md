The variable `cy` is assigned the value of the average of `y1` and `y2`. The initial state indicates that `cy` previously held the average of the last two `y` values from `meats`, but now it will be explicitly calculated as `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`my` is updated to the final calculated value, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is N - 2, `j` is N - 1, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to half the difference of the last two `x` values, `dy` is equal to half the difference of the last two `y` values, `d2` is equal to the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.**
