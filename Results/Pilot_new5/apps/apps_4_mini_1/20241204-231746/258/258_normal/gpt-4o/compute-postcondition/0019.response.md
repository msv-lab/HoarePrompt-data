The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 3, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[4]`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `y` is now an integer corresponding to the value in `data[4]`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 4, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuples `(x, int(data[7]), c)` and `(x, y, c)`, where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `index` is 3, `y` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
