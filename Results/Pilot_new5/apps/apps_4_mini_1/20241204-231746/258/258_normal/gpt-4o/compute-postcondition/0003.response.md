The code initializes the `meats` variable as an empty list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state reflects the new value of `meats` while maintaining the previous values of `N` and `K`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list.**
