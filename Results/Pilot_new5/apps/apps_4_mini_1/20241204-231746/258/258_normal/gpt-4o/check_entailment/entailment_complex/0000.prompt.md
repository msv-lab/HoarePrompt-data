You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):

            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)
            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `my` is the final calculated value after all valid iterations, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` may be greater than or equal to `K` or less than `K`, `i` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `d` is non-negative or invalid for the last evaluated iteration, and if the loop did not execute, `my` retains its original value and `count` is the initial sum of `c` for distances calculated before the loop.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the condition of the loop was not satisfied, and my retains its final calculated value while count reflects its initial sum for distances calculated before the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of different pieces of meat, a positive integer `K`, and a positive real number `T`. It evaluates pairs of meats to calculate a midpoint and checks if the sum of hardnesses for meats within distance `T` from this midpoint meets or exceeds `K`. If any valid midpoint meets this condition, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list of meats or cases where `K` is greater than the number of meats, which may lead to unintended behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants ready, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is the highest value less than or equal to the maximum hardness of meat pieces such that `func_1(meats, K, low)` is true, `high` is greater than `low + 1e-07`, and `mid` is approximately equal to `low`. The loop will stop when the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high which is greater than low + 1e-07
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness of meat pieces that can meet the requirement defined by `func_1`. The function returns a value `high` that is greater than `low + 1e-07`, which represents the approximate maximum hardness.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])

        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples of the form `(x, y, c)` where each x, y, c is equal to `int(data[2 + 3*i])`, `int(data[3 + 3*i])`, `int(data[4 + 3*i])` for i in range(N), `index` is `2 + 3 * N`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `N` and `K`, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60) and `K` represents the number of pieces to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N). It also accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. The function then processes this input and calls another function `func_2`, passing the parameters to it. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. However, it does not handle any exceptions or input validation, which could lead to errors if the input format is incorrect.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
