Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
