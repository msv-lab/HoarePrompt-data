Output State: **`my` is updated to the final calculated value based on the last executed iteration, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is equal to `N - 1`, `d` is non-negative and valid for the last iteration, `cx` is equal to the average of the last two `x` values from `meats`, `cy` is equal to the average of the last two `y` values from `meats`, `dx` is equal to half the difference of the last two `x` values, `dy` is equal to half the difference of the last two `y` values, `d2` is equal to the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K` if the function returns True, else no return value is provided.**
