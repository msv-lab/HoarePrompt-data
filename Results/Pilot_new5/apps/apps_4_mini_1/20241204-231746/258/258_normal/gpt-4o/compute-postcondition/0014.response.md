The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `index` is 6, so `index + 2` equals 8. Therefore, `c` will now hold the value of `int(data[8])`. The other variables (`N`, `K`, `meats`, `index`, `x`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuple `(x, int(data[7]), c)` where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `index` is 6, and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])**
