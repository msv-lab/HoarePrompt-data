The variable `d` is updated by dividing its current value by the product of `c1` and `c2`. The states of the other variables (`count`, `j`, `N`) remain unchanged. If `d` was previously non-zero, it is now updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`. 

Output State: **`count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`**
