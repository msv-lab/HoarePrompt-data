Postcondition: ***`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2;` `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True. If not, there is no else part of the program; thus, no value is returned.***
