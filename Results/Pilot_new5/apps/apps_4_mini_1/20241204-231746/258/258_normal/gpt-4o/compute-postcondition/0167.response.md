Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `count` is equal to the number of tuples where sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) and count is less than K, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` is assigned values from `meats[i]`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned values from `meats[j]`.**
