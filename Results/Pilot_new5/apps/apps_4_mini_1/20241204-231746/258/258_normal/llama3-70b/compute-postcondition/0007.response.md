The value of `times` is assigned the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The function `func_2` is called with `x` and `y` being -1000 and -999, respectively. The value of `times` will depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `times` or `ans` without further information.

Since `ans` depends on `times[K - 1]`, we cannot update `ans` until we know the value of `times`. However, `x`, `y`, and `K` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the result of func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)**.
