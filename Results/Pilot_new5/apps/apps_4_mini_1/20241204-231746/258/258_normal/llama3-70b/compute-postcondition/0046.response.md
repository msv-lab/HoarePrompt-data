Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, and it calculates the minimum value from the sorted list of times generated by calling `func_2` with all combinations of integers `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000. It returns the value at the (K-1)th index of the sorted `times` list, where `K` is a positive integer indicating that at least `K` values must exist in `times`. However, the function does not handle cases where `times` has fewer than `K` elements, which could lead to an IndexError. **
