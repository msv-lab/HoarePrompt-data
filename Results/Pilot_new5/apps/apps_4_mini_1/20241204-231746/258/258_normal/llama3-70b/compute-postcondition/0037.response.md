The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `K` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to `N`, and `times` is sorted. The values of `x`, `y`, and `K` do not change. The exact value of `times[K - 1]` is not provided, but it will represent the element at index `K - 1` in the sorted `times` array, which is a valid access because `K` is between 1 and `N`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**
