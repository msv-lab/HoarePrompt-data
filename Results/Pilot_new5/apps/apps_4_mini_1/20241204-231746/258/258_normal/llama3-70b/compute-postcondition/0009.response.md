In this case, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value at the `K-1` index of the `times` list. The variable `K` is a positive integer within the range from 1 to N, which guarantees that `times[K - 1]` is a valid index in the sorted list `times`. The specific values of `ans` and `times` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after the operation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`.**
