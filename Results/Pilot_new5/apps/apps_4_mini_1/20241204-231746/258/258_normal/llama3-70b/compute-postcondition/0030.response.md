According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y`, which is defined to run from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The current state of `y` is 1000, but it needs to be adjusted to fit the range of the loop. The loop will execute for each integer value of `y` starting from -1000 up to 1000. 

To ensure the loop can execute properly, we need to modify `y` to start from -1000. The other variables `x`, `K`, and `times` do not affect the loop execution itself, but `K` should be a valid positive integer and `times` should be sorted for the loop body to function correctly if it relies on those variables.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `y` must be initialized to -1000 to start the loop at its first iteration.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted across all iterations**
