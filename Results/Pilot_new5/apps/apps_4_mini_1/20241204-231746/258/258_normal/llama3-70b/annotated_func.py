#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the two-dimensional plane, calculated using the formula sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four real number parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y). The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as invalid input types (non-numeric values) or the situation where the input points are identical, which would result in a distance of 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are the coordinates (float or int) of a piece of meat, X and Y are the coordinates (float) of the heat source, where X and Y are real numbers.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from 'meats' with the result of 'func_1' applied to the coordinates of the piece of meat (x, y) and the heat source (X, Y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `x` and `y`, which are the coordinates of a piece of meat (either floats or integers), and `X` and `Y`, which are the coordinates of a heat source (floats). It returns a list of values obtained by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from the `meats` list with the result of `func_1` called with the coordinates of the meat and the heat source. The function assumes that `meats` is defined in the scope of the function and accessible during execution. If `meats` is not properly defined, it will raise a NameError.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000, and K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N where N is the total number of pieces of meat.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is sorted in non-decreasing order for each pair of `(x, y)`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations for the given values of `x` and `y`, where `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, and it calculates the minimum value from the sorted list of times generated by calling `func_2` with all combinations of integers `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000. It returns the value at the (K-1)th index of the sorted `times` list, where `K` is a positive integer indicating that at least `K` values must exist in `times`. However, the function does not handle cases where `times` has fewer than `K` elements, which could lead to an IndexError.
