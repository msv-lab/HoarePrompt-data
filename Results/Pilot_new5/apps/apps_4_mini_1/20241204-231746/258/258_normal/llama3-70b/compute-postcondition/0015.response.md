According to the code, the for loop iterates over `x` from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. The loop can execute one more time if `x` is less than 1000 at the end of the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `x` being -999. The loop will continue to run until `x` reaches 1000.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
