The function `func_3` accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000, and `K`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of pieces of meat. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations for the given values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `K`, and return the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `K`, then returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations for the given values of `x` and `y`.**
