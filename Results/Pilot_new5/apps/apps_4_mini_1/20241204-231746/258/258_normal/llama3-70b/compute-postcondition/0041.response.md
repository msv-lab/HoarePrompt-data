The `ans` variable is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the element at index `K - 1` of the sorted `times` list. The `times` list has already been sorted in ascending order prior to this operation. 

Since `times` is a list, the specific values are not provided, but we know it has been sorted. The state of `ans` will depend on its previous value and the value at `times[K - 1]` after the sorting.

The other variables `x`, `y`, and `K` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to min(ans, times[K - 1])**.
