The `times` variable is assigned the output of the function `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, once the `sort()` method is called on `times`, it will rearrange the elements of `times` in ascending order. As the values of `x` and `y` do not change due to this operation and since `K` is a positive integer within the range specified, the only variable affected is `times`. 

The new state of `times` will be its sorted version, but we don't have the exact values from `func_2`, so we can't specify the exact sorted order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted version of its previous values.**
