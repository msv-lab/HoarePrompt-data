To evaluate the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the function `func_2` on the variables `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1001
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is the sorted version of its previous values
- `ans` remains unchanged

The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, which suggests that it may return or modify a list or collection based on the input values of `x` and `y`. However, as we have no information about the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot definitively determine the values that `times` will hold after this function call. 

The only information we can maintain is that `times` will be sorted based on the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is -999 and `y` is 1001, the sorted values would yield `times` as `[-999, -999, 1001, 1001]`. 

The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the update to `times` based on the inputs, while keeping all other variables the same.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1001, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is `[-999, -999, 1001, 1001]`, `ans` remains unchanged**.
