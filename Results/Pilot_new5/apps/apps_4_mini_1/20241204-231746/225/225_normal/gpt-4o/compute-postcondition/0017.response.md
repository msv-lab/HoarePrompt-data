The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the distance from the last found vowel (given by `prev_pos`) to the end of the string `s`. If `prev_pos` is -1 (indicating no vowels have been found), then `len(s) - prev_pos` becomes `len(s) - (-1)`, which equals `len(s) + 1`. This means `max_jump` will be updated to either its current value or `len(s) + 1`.

If there are vowels in the string, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel, making `len(s) - prev_pos` a positive integer less than or equal to `len(s)`.

Overall, the output reflects that `max_jump` has been changed based on the conditions described.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present; `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)**
