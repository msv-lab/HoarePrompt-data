In the provided code snippet, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. The variables affected by the code are `max_jump`, `i`, and `prev_pos`. The values of `i` and `prev_pos` are known: `i` is 2 and `prev_pos` is 0. Therefore, `i - prev_pos` equals `2 - 0`, which is `2`.

Since `max_jump` is being compared to this calculated value (2), the new value of `max_jump` will depend on its previous value. However, the exact previous value of `max_jump` is not specified. Thus, we will keep the condition that `max_jump` can either remain the same or be updated to 2.

The states of `s`, `vowels`, `prev_pos`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the uncertainty regarding the value of `max_jump`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 0, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is either its previous value or 2.**
