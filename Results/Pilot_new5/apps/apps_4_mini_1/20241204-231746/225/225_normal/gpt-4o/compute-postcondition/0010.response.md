The value of `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `prev_pos` will now be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 1, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1.
