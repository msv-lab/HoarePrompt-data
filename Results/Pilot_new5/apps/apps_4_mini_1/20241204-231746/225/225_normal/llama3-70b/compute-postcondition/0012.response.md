The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not provided, so we will consider `last_vowel` to be equal to `i`. The value of `max_jump` may or may not change based on whether `last_vowel` is equal to -1 or not, but since the exact value of `i` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact changes to `max_jump`. However, we know that `last_vowel` is updated to `i` and remains unchanged in the next operations. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string of capital English letters, `last_vowel` is equal to `i`, and the condition for `max_jump` remains based on `last_vowel` and its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `last_vowel` is equal to `i`, and the condition for `max_jump` remains based on `last_vowel` and its previous value.**
