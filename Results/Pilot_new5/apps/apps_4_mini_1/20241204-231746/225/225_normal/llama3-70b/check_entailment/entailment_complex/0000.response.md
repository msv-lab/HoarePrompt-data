Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The main issue lies in how the jumps are calculated between vowels. 

1. **Jump Calculation**: The problem specifies that the Grasshopper can jump to any vowel with a distance from 1 to the maximum jump ability. The program attempts to find the maximum distance between consecutive vowels and divides that distance by 2, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the maximum possible length of a jump. Instead, it should find the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and take the maximum of these distances directly. 

2. **Handling of the Last Vowel**: The condition that checks if the last character is not a vowel seems to miscalculate the necessary jump ability. The problem states that the Grasshopper needs to reach the position right after the last character of the string. If the last character is a consonant, the jump required should be the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, but this is calculated incorrectly in the provided implementation.

3. **No Vowel Edge Case**: The program calculates a `max_jump` of 0 if there are no vowels, which does not match the problem's requirement to return the number of symbols for the jumps. In such a case, the Grasshopper would not be able to make any jumps, and thus the behavior should be explicitly defined, rather than deriving a jump ability of 0.

Given these discrepancies, the program does not meet all the requirements laid out in the problem description.
