To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The code calculates a new value for `max_jump` based on its current value, the length of the string `s` (`n`), and the index of the last vowel found in `s` (`last_vowel`).
2. The expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` computes the jump distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, divided by 2, and adds 1. This accounts for half the distance plus one additional unit.
3. The new value for `max_jump` is determined by taking the maximum of its current value and the calculated distance.

Given the initial state, the output state can be summarized based on the changes to `max_jump`. The values of `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `last_vowel` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**.
