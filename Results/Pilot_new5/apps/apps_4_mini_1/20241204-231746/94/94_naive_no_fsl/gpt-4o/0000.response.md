Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The key issue lies in the condition used to determine if both puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the line `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` uses the bitwise AND operator `&`, which checks if there is a common element in both sets. However, it does not check if the two sets are equal, which is necessary to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

With this input, `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable` would contain different configurations that are reachable from the initial setup, but they wouldn't contain the same configurations in their entirety, leading to a false positive in the output.

The expected output for the above input should be "NO", but with the current implementation, it may output "YES" incorrectly due to the flawed check. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least this case, making it incorrect.
