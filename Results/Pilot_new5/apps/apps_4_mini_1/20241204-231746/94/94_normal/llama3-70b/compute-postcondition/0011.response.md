Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `puzzle2[4]` is 'X', then the condition holds true, and the state of the program reflects this condition. If `puzzle1[4]` is not 'X', the program will not execute any commands related to this condition.***
