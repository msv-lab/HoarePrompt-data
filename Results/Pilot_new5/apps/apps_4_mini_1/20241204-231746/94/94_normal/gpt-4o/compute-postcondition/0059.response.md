`new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list that is a copy of the string `current`. The previous value of `current` is 'AXCB', so the new list will contain the characters ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'ACXB', `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**
