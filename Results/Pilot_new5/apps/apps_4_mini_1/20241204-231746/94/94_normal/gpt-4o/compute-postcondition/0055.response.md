Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and if `new_state_str` is 'ACXB' and not previously in `visited`, then `visited` is updated to include 'ACXB', and `queue` is updated to include 'ACXB', with `current` remaining as 'AXCB', `empty_pos` being 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], and `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'.***
