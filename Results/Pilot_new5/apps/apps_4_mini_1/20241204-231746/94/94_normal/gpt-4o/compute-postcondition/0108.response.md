The value of `new_state_str` is assigned the result of joining the elements of the list `new_state`, which is created from `current` with the values at indices `1` and `empty_pos` swapped. The variable `new_state_str` will now be a string representation of this new state derived from `current`. Other variables (`start`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2; `new_state_str` is the result of joining `new_state`.**
