The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string of length 4 that consists of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents the empty cell, and each of 'A', 'B', and 'C' appears exactly once. After executing the function body, it returns all unique valid states generated from the input string during all iterations, which are contained in the `visited` variable. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a specific string format and return all unique valid states generated from that string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start, which is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns all unique valid states generated from the input during all iterations.**
