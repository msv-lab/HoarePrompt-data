The code swaps the characters in the `new_state` list at the indices `empty_pos` (1) and `new_pos`, which is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`. The impact of the code on the program involves changing the values in the `new_state` list.

1. The `empty_pos` is 1, which corresponds to the character 'X' in `start` ('AXCB').
2. `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated as follows: `new_row = 0 + dr` and `new_col = 1 + dc`. The values of `dr` and `dc` are not provided, but they determine the new position to swap with the empty position.
3. The `new_pos` is calculated as `(0 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`. This will also determine the index of the character to swap with `new_state[empty_pos]`.

Assuming `dr` and `dc` are designed to move within the bounds of the 2D representation of the string and the indices are valid, the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` will be swapped. 

Without specific values for `dr` and `dc`, we cannot determine the exact characters involved in the swap, but we can represent that the characters at those positions have been swapped.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str`; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` remains the first element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_state` is the list of characters from `current` with the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
