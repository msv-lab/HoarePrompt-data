The variable `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`, and `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are 0 and 1, respectively. The values of `dr` and `dc` depend on the `(n+1)`th pair in the directions, which is conditional based on whether it exists. However, the specific values for `dr` and `dc` are not provided. Therefore, without specific numeric values for `dr` and `dc`, the exact values of `new_row` and `new_col` cannot be determined.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_row` is `0 + dr` and `new_col` is `1 + dc`.**
