`new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, but `current` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact value that `new_state` will take. However, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is equal to `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`; `new_state` is a list of `current` (value unknown); `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_row` is `1 + dr`; `new_col` is `1 + dc`.**
