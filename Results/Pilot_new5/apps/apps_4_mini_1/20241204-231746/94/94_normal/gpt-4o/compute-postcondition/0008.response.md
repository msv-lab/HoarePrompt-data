The `new_row` and `new_col` variables are calculated based on the `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The value of `empty_row` is 1, and the value of `empty_col` is 1. With `dr` equal to -1 and `dc` equal to 0, the calculation for `new_row` and `new_col` is as follows:

- `new_row` = `empty_row` + `dr` = 1 + (-1) = 0
- `new_col` = `empty_col` + `dc` = 1 + 0 = 1

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1.**
