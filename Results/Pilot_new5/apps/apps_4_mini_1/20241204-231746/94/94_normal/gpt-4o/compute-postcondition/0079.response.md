The value of `empty_pos` is assigned the index of 'X' in the string `current`. The initial state has not provided a specific value for `current`, but it is stated that `current` is the first element of `queue`, which contains all new valid states. Therefore, the value of `empty_pos` will be determined based on the index of 'X' within that first element.

Assuming `current` has 'AXCB' or a similar state containing 'X', `empty_pos` will be updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains all new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col` represent the original empty space location.**
