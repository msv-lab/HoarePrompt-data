Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` now includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not already present, and the `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet, with `new_state_str` added to it, while `current` is the first element of the `queue`, and `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, and `empty_col` is 1. If `new_state_str` was already in `visited`, then the state remains unchanged.***
