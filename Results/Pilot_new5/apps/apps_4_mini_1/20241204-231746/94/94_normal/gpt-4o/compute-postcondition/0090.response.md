The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. This action modifies the `queue` variable by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged, but their previous states must still be noted.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, plus `new_state_str`, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1.**
