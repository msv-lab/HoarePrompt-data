The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the existing list `queue`. The previous values of the affected variable `queue` included 'AXCB' and 'ABCX', and `new_state_str` is now added to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is unknown; `new_state` is a list of `current` (value unknown); `new_state_str` is now added to `visited`; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `new_state_str`; `queue` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `new_state_str`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1.**
