The code snippet updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, which are not provided in the initial state. However, `empty_row` is given as 0 and `empty_col` is given as 1. Therefore, `new_row` will be equal to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` will be equal to `empty_col + dc`. 

Since we do not have the specific values for `dr` and `dc`, we can only state that `new_row` and `new_col` will be determined relative to those values.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already present, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it, `current` remains the first element of the `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0 + `dr`, `new_col` is 1 + `dc`, and `directions` has more tuples to allow another iteration.**
