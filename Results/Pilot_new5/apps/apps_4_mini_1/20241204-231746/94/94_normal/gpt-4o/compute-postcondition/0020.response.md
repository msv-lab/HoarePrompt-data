The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are 1 and 1, respectively. The values of `dr` and `dc` will be updated to the next values in `directions`, but those specific values are not provided. Therefore, the expression for `new_row` and `new_col` will depend on the updated values of `dr` and `dc`. 

Thus, `new_row` becomes `1 + dr` and `new_col` becomes `1 + dc`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` contains 'AXCB'; `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`.**
