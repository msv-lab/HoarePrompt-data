`a` is assigned the value of `a` multiplied by 3. The possible values for `a` are 3, 6, or 9. Therefore, the updated values of `a` will be 9, 18, or 27 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` must be greater than or equal to 9; `years` is 1**
