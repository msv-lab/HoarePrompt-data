The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in the provided definition. However, it is implied that the function operates based on the constraints that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively, with Limak's weight being less than or equal to Bob's weight. Since the output behavior is not given in the prompt, we cannot derive specific return values or cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with two integers `a` and `b`, constrained by the specified weights of Limak and Bob, although the exact return value or behavior of the function is unclear from the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates with two integers a and b, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, constrained such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.**
