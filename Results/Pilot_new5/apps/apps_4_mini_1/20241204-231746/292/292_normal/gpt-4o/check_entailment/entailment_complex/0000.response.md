Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) are guaranteed by the problem description, and the program assumes valid input according to these constraints.

2. **Weight Calculation**:
   - Limak's weight is tripled every year (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled every year (`b *= 2`).
   - The loop continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).

3. **Year Counter**: The program maintains a counter `years` which is incremented each iteration of the loop to track how many years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

4. **Exit Condition**: The loop ensures that it only exits when Limak’s weight is strictly greater than Bob’s weight, fulfilling the requirement of the problem statement that Limak wants to be "strictly larger" than Bob.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob, which is what the problem statement asks for.

As all these points align perfectly with the requirements stated in the problem, the result is that the program is correct and will always provide the right output for any valid input within the defined constraints.
