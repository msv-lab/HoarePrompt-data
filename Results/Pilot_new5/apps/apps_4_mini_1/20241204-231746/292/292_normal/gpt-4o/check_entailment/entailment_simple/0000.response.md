The annotated program appears to correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. Let's analyze how it works to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from input, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
   - Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`), which matches the growth rates specified in the problem description.

3. **Year Counting**:
   - A variable `years` is initialized to zero and incremented with each iteration of the loop. This correctly counts the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of years after Limak's weight has exceeded Bob's weight, which is the expected output.

5. **Boundary Cases**:
   - The program also handles the guarantee in the problem description that Limak's weight is initially less than or equal to Bob's weight (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).
   - The program will eventually break the loop since Limak's weight is being tripled while Bob's weight is only doubled, ensuring that Limak will surpass Bob's weight after a finite number of years.

Now, let's consider the correctness by checking against the provided examples:
- For the input `4 7`, the output of `2` years is indeed correct as shown in the example.
- For the input `4 9`, the output of `3` years is also correct.
- For the input `1 1`, the output correctly returns `1`, as Limak's weight triples to `3` after the first year and exceeds Bob's weight.

Since the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description in all tested cases and aligns with the logic provided, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
