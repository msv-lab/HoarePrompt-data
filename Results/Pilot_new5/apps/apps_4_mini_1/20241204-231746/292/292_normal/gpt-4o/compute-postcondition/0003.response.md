`a` is assigned the value of `a` multiplied by 3. The value of `a` can vary based on the input but will always be within the bounds of 1 to 10. Since `b` is also an integer from the input with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, we can determine the new possible values for `a`. After executing the code, `years` remains unchanged at 0.

- If `a` was 1, then `a` becomes 3.
- If `a` was 2, then `a` becomes 6.
- If `a` was 3, then `a` becomes 9.
- If `a` was 4, then `a` becomes 12 (but this is not valid since `4 ≤ b ≤ 10`).
- If `a` was 5, then `a` becomes 15 (also not valid).
- If `a` was 6, then `a` becomes 18 (also not valid).
- If `a` was 7, then `a` becomes 21 (also not valid).
- If `a` was 8, then `a` becomes 24 (also not valid).
- If `a` was 9, then `a` becomes 27 (also not valid).
- If `a` was 10, then `a` becomes 30 (also not valid).

Thus, the valid new values for `a` after execution will only be 3, 6, or 9.

Output State: **`a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is an integer from the input with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10; `years` is 0.**
