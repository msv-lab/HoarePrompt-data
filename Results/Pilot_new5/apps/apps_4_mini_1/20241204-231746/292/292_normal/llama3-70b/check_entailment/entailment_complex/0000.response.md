The given Python program implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s an analysis of the program in relation to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob respectively. It correctly follows the constraint that Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).

2. **Weight Growth Logic**: The program uses a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). Within each iteration of the loop:
   - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   - A counter for the number of years (`years`) is incremented.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. At this point, the program correctly prints the number of years that have passed.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the number of full years it took for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, which directly matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

5. **Validation of Logic Against Examples**: The program handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly:
   - For the input `4 7`, it calculates that Limak will be heavier after 2 years, which aligns with the example provided.
   - For the input `4 9`, it correctly identifies that Limak will be heavier after 3 years.
   - For the input `1 1`, it appropriately counts that Limak becomes heavier after 1 year.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
