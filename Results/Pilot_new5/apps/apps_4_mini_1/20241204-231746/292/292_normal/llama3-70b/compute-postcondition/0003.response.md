In this scenario, the code multiplies the variable `a` by 3. Given the initial condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the value of `a` must be in the range of 1 to 10, inclusive. Therefore, after the operation `a *= 3`, the new value of `a` will be within the range of `3` to `30`, depending on its initial value. However, since `b` must still be greater than or equal to `a` after the multiplication, the new value of `a` will depend on its previous value.

If `a` was originally:
- 1, then `a` becomes 3.
- 2, then `a` becomes 6.
- 3, then `a` becomes 9.
- 4, then `a` becomes 12 (which violates the condition `a ≤ b ≤ 10` if `b` is still ≤ 10).
- 5, then `a` becomes 15 (same issue).
- 6, then `a` becomes 18 (same issue).
- 7, then `a` becomes 21 (same issue).
- 8, then `a` becomes 24 (same issue).
- 9, then `a` becomes 27 (same issue).
- 10, then `a` becomes 30 (same issue).

Thus, the only valid transformations for `a` under the constraint that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10` are:
- If `a` is 1, 2, or 3, `a` can be transformed to 3, 6, or 9 respectively and still maintain `b` as greater than or equal to `a` while adhering to the original condition.

However, since we do not have the specific initial value of `a`, we cannot define an exact output state beyond the case distinctions.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is ≥ `a`; `years` is 0**
