The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The initial state indicates that `b` is at least 36, so after the operation, `b` will be at least 72. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 27, `b` is at least 72, `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is 27, `b` is at least 72, `years` is 2**
