The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Given the initial constraints, `1 ≤ a ≤ 3` and `a` must be at least 9, the only possible value for `a` that satisfies both conditions is 9. When `a` is multiplied by 3, the new value of `a` becomes `9 * 3 = 27`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is 27, `b` is at least 36, `years` is 2**
