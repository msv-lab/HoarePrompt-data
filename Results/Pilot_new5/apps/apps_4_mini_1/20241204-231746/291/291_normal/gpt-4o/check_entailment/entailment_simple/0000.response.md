To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program and how it relates to the problem requirements.

### Problem Summary
The task is to compute the minimum number of segments Little Sofia must draw with a ruler (without guides) to create `n` squares on a plane, where each square consists of 4 segments (2 vertical and 2 horizontal). The program must minimize the segments drawn with a ruler by utilizing existing segments as guides.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of squares.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the minimum number of segments needed. 
   - It initializes `min_segments_needed` to infinity.
   - The program iterates over possible values of `a` from `1` to `sqrt(n)`. This is done to divide the squares into dimensions that are as close to a rectangle as possible (i.e., `a` rows and `b` columns).
   - The calculation of `b` is done using integer division, ensuring that it accounts for any remainders in the division of `n` by `a`.
   - For each `a`, it calculates `segments_needed` as `2 * (a + b)`, which accounts for the segments needed for both dimensions.
   - It updates `min_segments_needed` with the minimum segments needed found so far.

3. **Return Value**:
   The function returns `min_segments_needed`, which represents the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic of the program correctly breaks down the problem of drawing squares into manageable pieces. The choice of iterating `a` from `1` to `sqrt(n)` ensures that all potential layouts of the squares are considered, as this is the typical way to pair factors of a number to minimize perimeter (in this case, the segments).

#### Why it Works
- For `n = 1`, it correctly calculates `2` segments.
- For `n = 2`, it correctly calculates `3` segments.
- For `n = 4`, it correctly calculates `4` segments.
- The logic generalizes for any `n`, ensuring that the segments are minimized by choosing the optimal dimensions that fit the number of squares.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description and correctly computes the minimum number of segments that Sofia must draw with a ruler.

Correctness: **True**
