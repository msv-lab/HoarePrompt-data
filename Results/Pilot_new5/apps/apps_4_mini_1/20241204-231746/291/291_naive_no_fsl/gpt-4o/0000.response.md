Correctness: **False**

The program aims to compute the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw without a ruler when drawing `n` squares. However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Case:
- For `n = 1`, the output is `2`, which is correct since two segments are needed to form one square.
- For `n = 2`, the output is `3`, which is also correct since three segments are needed.
- For `n = 4`, the output is `4`, which is correct as well. 

However, let's consider a case where `n = 5`. 
- The correct answer should be `5` because:
  - To draw 5 squares, Sofia can draw a 2x2 square (using 4 segments), and then add the fifth square adjacent, requiring 1 additional segment drawn without a guide.
  
The function currently computes the minimum segments needed based on the logic of dividing `n` into two dimensions, but it fails to account for all spatial configurations of squares. The calculation may not always yield the correct minimum segments required, specifically for cases like `n = 5` and other non-perfect square configurations.

Thus, since the function does not handle all cases correctly, the program is deemed incorrect.
