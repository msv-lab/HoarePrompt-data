The `exit()` command causes the program to terminate immediately, which means that no further operations are performed and the state of the variables does not change. Therefore, all the values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is equal to `(n - 1358023) // 1234`, and the output is 'YES'.**
