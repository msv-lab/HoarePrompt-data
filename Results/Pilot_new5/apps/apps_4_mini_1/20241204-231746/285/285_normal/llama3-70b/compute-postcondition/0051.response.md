The code snippet contains a single print statement, which will output 'YES'. The variables in the initial state are not modified by this code, hence their values remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State captures the unchanged values of all variables as well as the output produced by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 2469134, `a` is unchanged, `b` is at least 1 more than its last value, `c` is calculated as `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, and the output is 'YES'.**
