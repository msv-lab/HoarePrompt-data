The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately, and as a result, no variables are modified or assigned new values. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the existing values and the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `(n - 1234567) // 1234`, and the program has terminated.**
