The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. Therefore, no variables are modified, and we simply acknowledge that the program has exited. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as there are no calculations or assignments taking place.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 1234567; `a` is 0; `b` is 0; `c` is `n // 1234`, and the program has exited.**
