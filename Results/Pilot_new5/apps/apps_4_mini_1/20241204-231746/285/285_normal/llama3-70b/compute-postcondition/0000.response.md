The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which indicates that `n` will now hold the integer input provided. Since `n` was originally a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), after the input it will remain within that range but will now reflect the specific integer provided by the user as input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer reflecting the value of `int(input())` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\**.
