The code `exit()` terminates the program. No variables are modified, and the program simply halts execution. Therefore, the Output State reflects that there has been no change to the variables, but indicates that the program execution has ended.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 2469134, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is equal to `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has exited.**
