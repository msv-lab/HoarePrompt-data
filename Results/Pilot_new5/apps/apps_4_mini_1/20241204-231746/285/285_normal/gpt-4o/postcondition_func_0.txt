The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if it is possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers such that the remaining money after these purchases is divisible by the cost of a computer. It returns 'YES' if such a combination exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'. Specifically, it checks all possible combinations of houses and cars that can be bought within the budget `n` and verifies if the leftover money can fully cover a computer's cost. If no valid combinations are found, it returns 'NO'.
