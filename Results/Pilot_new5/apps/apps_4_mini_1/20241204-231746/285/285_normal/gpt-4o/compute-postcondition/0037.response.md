To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables based on the provided state:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The `for` loop is controlled by the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. For the loop to execute, this expression must be greater than 0.
   
2. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * 1234567`.
   - Since `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, the maximum value of `a` is limited by `n // 1234567`.
   - Thus, `a * 1234567` will be at least `1234567` (when a is 1) and at most `n` (when `a` is at its maximum value).

3. **Analysis of `remaining_after_houses`**:
   - To ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is positive, we need: 
     \[
     n - a * 1234567 > 0 \implies n > a * 1234567
     \]
   - As `a` can take values from 1 to `n // 1234567`, it's important to ensure that even for the minimum value of `a`, `remaining_after_houses` remains non-negative.

4. **Consequences for `b`**:
   - The loop will not execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is less than 0, which implies:
     \[
     remaining_after_houses < 0 \implies n < a * 1234567
     \]
   - Therefore, we need to guarantee that `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative for the loop to execute, which can only happen if `car_cost` is a positive integer.

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - We need to set `remaining_after_houses` to ensure it is non-negative, meaning `n` should be greater than `a * 1234567`.
   - We also must ensure that there exists a valid value for `b`, which depends on `remaining_after_houses` being positive and `car_cost` being a positive integer.

Thus, the adjusted states to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `n` must be greater than `a * 1234567`
- `remaining_after_houses` must be calculated correctly
- `b` starts at 0

Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `car_cost` is a positive integer, `b` is 0**
