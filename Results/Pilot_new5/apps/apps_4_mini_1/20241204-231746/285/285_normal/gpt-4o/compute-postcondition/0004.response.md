`remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. The value of `a` can take on any integer value from 0 up to `n // house_cost`, which means `a * house_cost` will be a multiple of `house_cost` that does not exceed `n`. Since `house_cost` is fixed at 1234567, the expression `a * house_cost` will yield values based on the value of `a`. 

As such, `remaining_after_houses` will be determined by the specific values of `n` and `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `house_cost` is a constant, the result for `remaining_after_houses` will be a non-negative integer calculated as `n - a * 1234567`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is 0 to `n // 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`.**
