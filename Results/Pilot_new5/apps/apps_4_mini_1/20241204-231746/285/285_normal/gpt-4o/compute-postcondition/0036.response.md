The variable `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value `n - a * house_cost`. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer within the bounds 1 to \(10^9\), `house_cost` is 1234567, and `a` is between 1 and \(n // house_cost\). Therefore, the value of `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * 1234567`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`.**
