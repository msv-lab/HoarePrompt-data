Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, and `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for purchasing houses and a car are met.***
