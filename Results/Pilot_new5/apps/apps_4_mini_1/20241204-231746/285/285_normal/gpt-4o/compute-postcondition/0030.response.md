According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `b`, which is controlled by the range defined as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to this upper limit. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `b` would have taken on a value such that it is currently equal to the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition.

Since `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `n - a * house_cost`, and `car_cost` is a positive integer, we also note that in order for the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

If `b` is currently at its maximum allowed value (`remaining_after_houses // car_cost`), then at the start of the next iteration, `b` must be increased by 1. 

Thus, if `b` is currently `b_current`, the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration will be `b_current + 1`.

Since the maximum value of `b` currently is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, for the loop to execute again, the conditions must change in a way that allows `b` to take on a value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 

Therefore, considering the structure of the loop and the current state, the updated states need to reflect that `b` has been incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
