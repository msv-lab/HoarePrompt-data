The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 0, the expression simplifies to `remaining_after_houses - 0 * car_cost`, which means `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses`. Therefore, the value of `remaining_after_cars` remains the same as `remaining_after_houses`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is between 1 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `car_cost` is a positive integer, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
