Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` and may or may not be divisible by `computer_cost`, depending on the values of `b`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` for any value of `b`, the output will indicate that the conditions for purchasing cars and computers are satisfied by returning 'YES'. Otherwise, if no `b` satisfies this condition, the function does not return anything.**
