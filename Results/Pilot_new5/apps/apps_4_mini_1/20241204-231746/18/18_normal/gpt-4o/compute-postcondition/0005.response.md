The code `print(k)` outputs the value of `k` to the console. However, the execution of `print` does not change the value of `k` or any other variables. Therefore, the output will simply reflect the value of `k`, while all other variables retain their states.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers; the value of `t` is greater than `k`; the current value of `t` is less than or equal to `n`; `k` is printed.**
