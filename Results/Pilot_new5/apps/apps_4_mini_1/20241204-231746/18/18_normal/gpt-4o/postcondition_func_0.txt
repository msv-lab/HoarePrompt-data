The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` (with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) and prints the value based on the following conditions: if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`; if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`; otherwise, it prints `n + k - t`. There is no explicit return value from the function.
