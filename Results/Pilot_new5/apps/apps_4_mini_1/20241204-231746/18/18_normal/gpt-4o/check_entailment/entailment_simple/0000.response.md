To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The task is to determine how many spectators are standing at a given time `t`, based on the following rules:

1. At time `1` to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases by one for each passing second until it reaches `k`.
2. At time `k + 1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`.
3. After time `n`, the number of spectators who are standing starts to decrease as each spectator who stood up earlier sits down, resulting in the number of standing spectators decreasing from `k` to `0`.

Now, let's break down the program:

1. The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`.
2. It checks if `t` is less than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `t`, which correctly indicates the number of standing spectators at that time.
3. If not, it checks if `t` is less than or equal to `n`. If true, it prints `k`, as the number of spectators remains constant at `k` during this period (from `k + 1` to `n`).
4. If `t` is greater than `n`, it computes `n + k - t` and prints it.

Now, let's consider if the calculation `n + k - t` will yield correct results when `t > n`. 
- For `t` in the range from `n + 1` to `n + k`, the number of standing spectators will correctly decrease from `k` to `0`. Specifically:
  - At `t = n + 1`, `n + k - (n + 1) = k - 1`, which is the correct number of standing spectators since one spectator has sat down.
  - At `t = n + 2`, `n + k - (n + 2) = k - 2`, which again is correct.
  - This pattern continues until at `t = n + k`, `n + k - (n + k) = 0`, which correctly indicates that there are no spectators standing.

The logic in the program accurately follows the problem description in all cases for the valid ranges of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Thus, the program meets all specified requirements and handles all potential edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
