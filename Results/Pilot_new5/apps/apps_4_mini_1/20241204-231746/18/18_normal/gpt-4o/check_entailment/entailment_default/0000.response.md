To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the program's logic.

### Problem Description:
The problem describes a sequence of spectators standing in a Mexican wave at specific times based on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`. The goal is to determine how many spectators are standing at time `t`.

1. For `t <= k`: The standing spectators increase one by one, so the output should be `t`.
2. For `k < t <= n`: The number of standing spectators reaches its maximum of `k` and remains constant (all k spectators are standing), so the output should be `k`.
3. For `n < t < n + k`: The spectators start sitting down one by one. The number of standing spectators decreases from `k` to `0`, and the output should be calculated as `n + k - t`.

### Program Logic:
The program logic is as follows:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)
```
1. If `t <= k`, it prints `t`.
2. If `t <= n`, it prints `k`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `n + k - t`.

### Edge Case Analysis:
Let's consider the edge cases:
- When `t = 1`: The output should be `1` since one spectator stands.
- When `t = k`: The output should be `k`, as it represents the maximum standing spectators.
- When `t = n`: The output should still be `k`, indicating all `k` spectators are still standing.
- When `t = n + 1`: Here, it should print `k - 1` (one spectator sits).
- When `t = n + k`: It should print `0` (all spectators are sitting).

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that:
- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`.
- If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`.
- Otherwise, it prints `n + k - t`.

These hints agree with the logic of the code.

### Final Assessment:
The code correctly implements the stated problem description and handles the edge cases outlined. The conditions are comprehensive and match the expected outputs given in the examples provided in the problem description.

Thus, I do not find any discrepancies or missing logic in the program.

Correctness: **True**. 
Explanation: The code correctly implements the rules governing the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`, as defined in the problem description. Each condition is properly accounted for, and the logic leads to the expected results for all specified ranges of `t`.
