The variable `min_x` is assigned the value of `(L + M - 1) // M`. Given that `L` and `M` are both positive integers, this expression calculates the ceiling of the division `L / M`. The states of the other variables `N`, `K` are not affected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are assigned values based on input integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`.
