The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints provided: N, M, K, and L, which are all positive integers with the following relationships: 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. The function's output is determined by these constraints and the relationships among the values of N, M, K, and L. Since the specific output conditions were not provided in the prompt, the output cannot be explicitly detailed. However, the function's ability to handle and process these values implies it performs some operations based on them.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates based on the internal values of N, M, K, and L, which are positive integers satisfying specific constraints. The output is determined by these values, but specific output conditions are not provided.**
