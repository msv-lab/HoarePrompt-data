Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not ensure that all three conditions are met for the friends to gift coins to Ivan. 

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins must be different.
3. At least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

The logic in the program checks whether:
- The number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to the number of new coins needed (`L`).
- The number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to the total number of different coins available minus the coins Ivan already has (`N - K + 1`).

However, there are situations where this logic fails:
- If `M` is greater than `N - K`, it may still not be possible to gift `L` new coins if `N - K` is smaller than `L` (since all coins must be different). 

For example:
**Input:** `5 3 3 3`
- Here, `N = 5` (total coins), `M = 3` (friends), `K = 3` (coins Ivan has), `L = 3` (coins that must be new).
- Ivan already has 3 different coins, leaving only 2 coins to choose from. 
- It's impossible for 3 friends to gift 3 new coins, but the program would incorrectly print `1` because it checks the wrong conditions. 

Thus, the program fails in this case, making it incorrect.
