Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible edge cases based on the problem description. 

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, L = 4
```

In this case:
- Ivan's friends are 11, but there are only 10 different coins available.
- Ivan already has 2 coins, so only 8 coins are available that could potentially be new to him.
- The requirement states that at least 4 coins must be new.

In this situation, it is impossible for the friends to gift Ivan the required number of new coins because the total number of different coins (10) is less than the number of friends (11). The program should correctly output `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the conditions.

However, the existing logic in the program checks:
```python
if M * min_x <= N - K:
```
This condition might not correctly identify that it's impossible to satisfy the gift conditions due to the number of friends exceeding the available different coins, which should lead to a direct conclusion of `-1`. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly account for this case, leading to a false result.
