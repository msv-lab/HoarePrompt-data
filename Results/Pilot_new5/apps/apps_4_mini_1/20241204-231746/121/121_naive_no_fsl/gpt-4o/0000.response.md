Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
n = 8
s = "??G??C??"
```

In this case, the program will replace the question marks with nucleotides, but since the total count of existing nucleotides ('G' and 'C') is only 2, and there are 6 question marks available, it will result in an output that does not meet the requirement of having equal counts for each 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

The correct output should be "===" because it is impossible to distribute the nucleotides equally based on the existing counts.

Another example could be:

```
n = 12
s = "A??A??C??G"
```

In this case, after replacing the question marks, the program could yield a string like "AAGACCTTGG", which would not satisfy the condition for equal counts, as it would have too many of one or more nucleotides.

The program should also check whether it's possible to reach a configuration where each nucleotide appears the required number of times after replacing all '?'. If any nucleotide exceeds its target count or if there are not enough '?' to reach the target for a nucleotide, it should print "===".

Thus, the implementation does not account for these edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.
