The function accepts an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4; if not, it terminates without returning any value. If `n` is valid, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and ensures that each of these characters appears exactly `n // 4` times. If any character exceeds this count, it terminates without returning any value. It replaces '?' in `s` with the necessary characters to achieve the target counts, then prints the modified string. If it is not possible to achieve the required counts, the function also terminates without returning any value.
