The code `print('===')` outputs a string but does not modify any variables or their values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` contains exactly 4 elements corresponding to the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and the current value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`.
