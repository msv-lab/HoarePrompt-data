Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for decoding the genome string `s`. Here's the breakdown of how the program meets the specified requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and verifies that the length of the genome `n` is between 4 and 255, and that it fits the requirement of being a multiple of 4. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, it immediately outputs "===" which is in accordance with the problem description.

2. **Count Calculation**: The program accurately counts occurrences of the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string. It maintains a dictionary `counts` to keep track of these counts.

3. **Validation of Counts**: Before attempting to replace '?', the program checks if any nucleotide exceeds `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If any nucleotide appears too many times, it outputs "===" and terminates, accurately addressing cases where it is impossible to meet the equal distribution.

4. **Replacement Logic**: The program iterates through the string `s`, replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotides based on the target count. It ensures that it only adds nucleotides until each type reaches the required count. This is efficient and adheres to the constraints of the problem.

5. **Final Output**: Once all necessary replacements are made, the program prints the modified string.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program is designed to handle cases where multiple solutions exist, and the output can be any valid configuration as allowed by the problem statement.

Thus, the program meets all conditions outlined in the problem description, providing correct outputs for all potential cases described.
