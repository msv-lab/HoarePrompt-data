Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` contains 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with counts less than or equal to `target_count`, and `char` is the next character in `counts`. If the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the behavior is not specified as there is no else part.***
