Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` reflects the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' such that counts[char] is equal to or less than `target_count`, and if `result[i]` is '?', it will be replaced by one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' to ensure that the counts remain within the limits defined by `target_count`, while the rest of `result` remains unchanged.***
