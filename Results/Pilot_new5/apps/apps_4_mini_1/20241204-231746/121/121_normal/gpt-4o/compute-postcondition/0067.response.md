Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` has at least `n + 1` characters, `char` is the next character in `counts` after the current one, and `i` remains `n`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
