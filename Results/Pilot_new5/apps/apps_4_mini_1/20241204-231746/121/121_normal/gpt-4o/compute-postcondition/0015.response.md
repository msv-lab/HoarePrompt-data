The value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Since `char` is the second character of `s`, we are directly modifying the count of that specific character in the `counts` dictionary or array. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `s`, and `char` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1**
