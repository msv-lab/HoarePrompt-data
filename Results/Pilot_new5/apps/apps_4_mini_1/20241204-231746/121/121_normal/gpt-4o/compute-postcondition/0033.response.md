Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` contains exactly 4 elements corresponding to the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`. If the count of `char` (the fourth element in `counts`) is greater than `target_count`, the program does not return any value (None). In all other cases, the program also does not return any value (None).***
