Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` has at least `n + 2` characters, and `char` is the next character in `counts`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[n]` is assigned the value of `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. No else part is defined.***
