Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the next character from `s`; if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is updated to include the character `nc`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and the previous index is incremented by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
