The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `c`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `count['?']` remain unchanged. The character `c` is a valid character from the string `s` that is not equal to '?'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a character from `s` that is not equal to '?', `count['?']` remains 0, and `res` is updated to `res + c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a character from `s` that is not equal to '?', `count['?']` remains 0, and `res` is updated to `res + c`.**
