`count[c]` is assigned the value of `avg - count[c]`. The value of `avg` is equal to `n // 4` and `count[c]` is currently the number of occurrences of 'C' in the string `s`. Therefore, `count['C']` is updated to `avg - count['C']`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `n // 4 - count['C']`, `count['G']` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `count['T']` is the number of occurrences of 'T' in `s`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4, c` is 'C'**
