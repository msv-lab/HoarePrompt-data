`res` is modified by appending the character `c` to it. The value of `c` is confirmed to be not equal to '?', and since it has not been defined in the initial state, it remains unspecified. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` is 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, `res` is equal to `c`, and `c` is not equal to '?'.
