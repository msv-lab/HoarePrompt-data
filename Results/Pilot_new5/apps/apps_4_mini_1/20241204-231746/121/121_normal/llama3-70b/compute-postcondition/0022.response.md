The variable `res` is assigned an empty string, which does not impact the other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, and `res` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, `res` is an empty string.**
