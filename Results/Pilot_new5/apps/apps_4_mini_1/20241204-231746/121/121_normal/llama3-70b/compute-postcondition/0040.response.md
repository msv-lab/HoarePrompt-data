Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `count['C']` is decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0; `count['A']` remains as `avg - count['A']`; `count['G']` remains as `avg - count['G']`; `count['T']` remains as `avg - count['T']`; `count['?']` remains 0; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`; and `res` is updated to `3 * 'G'`. No changes occur if `count[nc]` is not greater than 0.***
