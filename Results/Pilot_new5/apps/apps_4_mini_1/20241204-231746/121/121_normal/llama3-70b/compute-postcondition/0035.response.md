Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and if `count['C']` was greater than 0, then `count['C']` is decremented by 1, `count['A']` remains as `avg - count['A']`, `count['G']` remains as `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` remains as `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, `res` is updated to `2 * nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
