Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are all less than or equal to `avg` (which is `n // 4`); `count['?']` is still 0; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`; `res` contains the first `n // 4` valid characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the order they were available from `count`; the current value of `c` is '?'.**
