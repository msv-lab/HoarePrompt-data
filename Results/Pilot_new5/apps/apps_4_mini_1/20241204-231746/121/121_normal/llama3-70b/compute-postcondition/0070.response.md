The statement `count[nc] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[nc]` by 1. The precondition states that `count[nc]` is greater than 0, so after this operation, `count[nc]` will be at least 0. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the next character from `s`; `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect their current values; `res` is updated to include the character `nc`; `count[nc]` is now decremented by 1 (previously greater than 0); previous index is incremented by 1.**
