The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The value of `n` will remain the same until it is assigned a new integer value from input, but since this is a new assignment of `s`, we retain the existing information about `n`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is the input string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
