The code snippet provided does not modify any variables or state. It simply prints the string '===' to the output. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a string containing characters from `s` with '?' replaced by characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their availability; `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect their final decremented values; `count['?']` remains 0; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`; and at least one of the counts in `count` is greater than 0.**
