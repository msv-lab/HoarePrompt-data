The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, calculates the average number of each nucleotide that should be present (which is `n // 4`), and replaces '?' in the string with the appropriate nucleotides from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' until the counts match the calculated average. If it is not possible to replace '?' such that all nucleotides are balanced, it prints '===', otherwise it prints the resulting string. Edge cases include scenarios where the input string `s` has too many '?' or where the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' cannot be balanced, leading to the output '===' instead of a valid string.
