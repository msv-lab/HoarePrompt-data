Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the next character from `s`; `res` contains the characters from `ACGT` added in order based on the availability in `count`; `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect their final decremented values or remain unchanged if not used; if all counts were greater than 0 then `res` includes all characters from `ACGT` up to the available counts, otherwise `res` will contain only the characters that were available at the start.**
