Postcondition: ***`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, and `ops` must have at least one element remaining. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is adjusted by 1. Otherwise, `dy` and `dx` may be adjusted based on the new `op`, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
