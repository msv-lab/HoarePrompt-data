According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ops`, which is derived from the string `operations`. The loop will iterate over each character in `operations` represented by `op`. For the loop to execute at least once, the string `operations` must have a length greater than 0 (i.e., `n` must be greater than 0). 

At the start of the loop, the variable `op` will take the value of the first character in `operations`. Therefore, we also need to ensure that `op` is initialized to the first character of `operations`.

To summarize, we need to adjust the states to ensure that:

1. `n` is greater than 0 (indicating that `operations` has at least one character),
2. `ops` (or `operations`) is the string of length `n`,
3. `op` is initialized to the first character of `operations`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `operations`**
