`uy` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the string `operations` still has a length greater than 1. The variable `op` remains the third character of `operations`, and `ux` is still adjusted based on the new `op`. Therefore, the only change is in `uy`, which is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length greater than 1, `op` is the third character of `operations`, `ux` is adjusted based on the new `op`, `uy` is increased by 1.**
