Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length greater than 1, and `op` is the second character of `operations`. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is adjusted downwards by 1 and `ux` is adjusted accordingly. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1 and `uy` is adjusted accordingly. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1 and `uy` is adjusted accordingly.***
