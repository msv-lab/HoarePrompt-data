In the given code snippet, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are assigned the values of 0, 0, 0, and 0 respectively. The initial state mentioned that `n` is an input integer, and `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The values of `x` and `y` are also provided from input.

The impact of the code is that the variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are all initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**.
