The variable `ops` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes a string input consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`, while `ops` becomes the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', (x, y) are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `ops` is a string input consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'**.
