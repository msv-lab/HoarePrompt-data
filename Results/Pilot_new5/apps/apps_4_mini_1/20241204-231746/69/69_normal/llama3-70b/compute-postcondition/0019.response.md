Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the first character of `operations`. If `op` is 'U', then `uy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decremented by 1.***
