The variable `final_y` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state specifies that `final_x` is already `0`, and now `final_y` is set to `0` as well. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers within the range -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 0.
