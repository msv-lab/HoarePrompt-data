Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i`, `operations`, and `position_map` remain unchanged; if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.***
