The value of `current_x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, including `final_x`, `final_y`, `target_pos`, `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i`, `operations`, `min_length`, and `position_map`. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x` is now equal to the previous value plus 1; `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i` is now equal to `i + 1`; `operations`, `min_length` is updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x` is equal to the previous value + 1; `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i` is now equal to `i + 1`; `operations`, `min_length` is updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1.**
