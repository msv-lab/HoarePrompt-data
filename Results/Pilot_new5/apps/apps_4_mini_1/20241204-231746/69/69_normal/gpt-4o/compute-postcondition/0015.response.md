Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9. If the current value of `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is set to -1 and `final_y` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is set to 1 and `final_y` is set to 0, with `op` equal to 'R' and `index` remaining 0, while `op` is not equal to 'U', 'D', or 'L'.***
