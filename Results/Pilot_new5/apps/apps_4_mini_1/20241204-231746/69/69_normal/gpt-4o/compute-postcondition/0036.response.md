To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze how the variables change based on the operations provided in the string `operations`. 

1. The loop iterates through each character in the string `operations` and modifies the values of `final_x` and `final_y` based on the operation:
   - `U` increments `final_y` by 1.
   - `D` decrements `final_y` by 1.
   - `L` decrements `final_x` by 1.
   - `R` increments `final_x` by 1.

2. The initial values of `final_x` and `final_y` are both 0.

3. After all iterations of the loop, `final_x` and `final_y` will reflect the net effect of all operations performed on them. Specifically, `final_x` will be influenced by the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, and `final_y` will be influenced by the number of 'U' and 'D' operations.

4. The final values of `final_x` and `final_y` can be determined as follows:
   - Let `count_U` be the number of 'U' operations.
   - Let `count_D` be the number of 'D' operations.
   - Let `count_L` be the number of 'L' operations.
   - Let `count_R` be the number of 'R' operations.
   
   Then:
   - `final_x = x + (count_R - count_L)`
   - `final_y = y + (count_U - count_D)`

5. If `n` is 0 (meaning no operations were provided), then `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Now we will summarize these aspects in the final output state format:

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`, `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`, `operations` is a string of length `n`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `x` and `y` are integers within the range -10^9 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9. If `n` is 0, then `final_x` is `x` and `final_y` is `y`.**
