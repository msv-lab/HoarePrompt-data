Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length at least 2, and `index` is 2. If `op` is 'U', then `final_y` is updated to `final_y + 1` and `final_x` is based on the second character of `operations`. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decreased by 1, `final_x` remains unchanged, and `index` is 2. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged, and `index` is 2. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is updated to `final_x + 1`, while `final_y` remains unchanged, and `index` is 2.***
