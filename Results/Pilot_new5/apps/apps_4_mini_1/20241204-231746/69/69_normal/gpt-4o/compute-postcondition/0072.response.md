Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is equal to `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to `current_x + 1`.***
