The statement `current_x -= 1` decreases the value of `current_x` by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state will reflect this adjustment.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x - 1 + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x` is now equal to `current_x - 1`, `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i` is now equal to `i + 1`, `operations`, `min_length` is updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
