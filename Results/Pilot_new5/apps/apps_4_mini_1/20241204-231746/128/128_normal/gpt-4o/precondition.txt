n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) representing the number of products on the shelves (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9) and the number of clients that will come to the shop (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9) for each of the n days.
