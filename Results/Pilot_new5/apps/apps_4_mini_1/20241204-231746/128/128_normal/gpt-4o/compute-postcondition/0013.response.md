The list `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in reverse order. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables, but changes the order of the elements in the `potential_sales_increase` list based on their values, arranging them from highest to lowest. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` contains `n` values each equal to `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in descending order, and `total_sales` is equal to the sum of `regular_sales`.**
