The variable `potential_sales_increase` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n, `regular_sales` is an empty list, and `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.
