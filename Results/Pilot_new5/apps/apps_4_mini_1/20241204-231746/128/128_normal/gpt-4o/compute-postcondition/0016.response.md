The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n).
- `days` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.

After executing the function body, it returns `total_sales`, which is calculated as the previous `total_sales` value plus the sum of the first `f` elements from the sorted list `potential_sales_increase`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), f (a non-negative integer), and days (a list of tuples containing two non-negative integers each). It returns total_sales, calculated as the previous total_sales plus the sum of the first f elements from the sorted list potential_sales_increase.**
