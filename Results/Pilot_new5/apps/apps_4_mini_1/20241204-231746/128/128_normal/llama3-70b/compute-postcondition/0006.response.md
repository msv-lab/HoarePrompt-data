The values of `k` and `l` are assigned from the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the split input into integers. Prior to this code execution, `k` and `l` were not defined. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list containing one tuple (k, l), where `k` is now an input integer and `l` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list containing one tuple (k, l) where `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
