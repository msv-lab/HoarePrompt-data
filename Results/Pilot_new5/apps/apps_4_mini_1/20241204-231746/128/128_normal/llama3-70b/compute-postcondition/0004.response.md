The list `days` is updated to include a new tuple consisting of the values of `k` and `l`. The initial state indicates that `days` is an empty list, and after executing the code, `days` will contain a single element, which is the tuple `(k, l)`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list containing one tuple (k, l), `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
