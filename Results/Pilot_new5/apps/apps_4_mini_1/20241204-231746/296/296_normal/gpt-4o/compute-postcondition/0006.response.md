The `divisors` list is updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 2. Since `divisors` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, it will contain a single element: 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is [2]; `i` is 2.**
