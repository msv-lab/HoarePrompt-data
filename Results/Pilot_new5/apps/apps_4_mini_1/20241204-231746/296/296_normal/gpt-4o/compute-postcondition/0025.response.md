The value of `k` is assigned the length of the `divisors` list, which contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`. Since `divisors` is not empty, `k` will be a positive integer representing the count of those divisors. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`, `i` is the last integer checked (up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`.**
