The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` has no unique divisors excluding 1 and `n`, the function returns 'NO' and indicates that the current value of divisors is empty. If `n` has unique divisors excluding 1 and `n`, the function returns 'YES', the count of unique divisors excluding 1 and `n` (denoted as k), and a list of tuples (1, d) for each unique divisor d. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and determine if there are unique divisors of `n`, appropriately returning 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions outlined.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 2. If there are no unique divisors excluding 1 and n, it returns 'NO' indicating the divisors are empty. If there are unique divisors, it returns 'YES', the count of unique divisors excluding 1 and n, and a list of tuples (1, d) for each unique divisor d.**
