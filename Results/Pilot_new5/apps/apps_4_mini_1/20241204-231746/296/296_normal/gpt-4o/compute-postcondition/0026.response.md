The list `fractions` is created using a list comprehension that includes pairs where the first element is `1` and the second element is each divisor `d` from the list `divisors`. The variable `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding `1` and `n`, and `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`, `i` is the last integer checked (up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`, and `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of (1, d) for each divisor d in `divisors`.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`; `i` is the last integer checked (up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`); `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`; `fractions` is a list of tuples (1, d) for each d in `divisors`.**
