The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` that is guaranteed to be between 2 and \(10^9\). It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it immediately returns 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, the function proceeds to find all unique divisors of `n` that are neither 1 nor `n` itself.

If there are no unique divisors found (i.e., the `divisors` list is empty), it returns 'NO' again. Conversely, if there are unique divisors, the function returns 'YES', along with the count of these divisors and a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of 1 and the divisor.

However, the code does not handle the case where `n` is prime effectively as it still returns 'YES' but with a count of 0 and an empty list in that scenario, which may lead to confusion. It also does not check for the case when `n` is equal to 4, where the divisors would be 2, and it would still return valid output even though it contains only one unique divisor.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returns 'NO' if `n` has no unique divisors other than 1 and `n`, and returns 'YES' along with the count and list of unique divisors otherwise. It does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is prime or edge cases like `n = 4` with only one divisor. **
