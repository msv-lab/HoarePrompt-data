The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The variable `i` has a value of 3. However, the initial state does not define `divisors`, so its previous state is undefined. The condition `n must be greater than or equal to 9` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `divisors` now includes the value 3**
