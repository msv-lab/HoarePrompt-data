The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' but does not modify any variables. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2; the output is 'NO'**.
