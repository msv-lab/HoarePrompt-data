The value of `k` is assigned the value `2`. The variable `n` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2**.
