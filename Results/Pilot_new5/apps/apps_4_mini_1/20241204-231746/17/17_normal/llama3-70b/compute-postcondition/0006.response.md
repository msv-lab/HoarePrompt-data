The function `func` accepts four parameters: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. All of these parameters are non-negative integers, constrained such that \(0 \leq cnt_i \leq 10^9\) for \(i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). Since the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided details, we cannot describe the return values or conditions that lead to different outputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is focused on accepting the specified non-negative integer parameters without detailing the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, which are non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 10^9.**
