The value of `cnt1` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input value and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `cnt1` while keeping `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` as non-negative integers within the range.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `cnt_1` <= 10^9, `cnt_2` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_3` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer**.
