The value of `n` is halved by the operation `n //= 2`. The initial conditions state that `n` is greater than 1, which means that after the operation, `n` will still remain greater than 0. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, and since there's no other operation in the code affecting `ans`, it remains the same as before. The value of `h` is also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects these updates.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
