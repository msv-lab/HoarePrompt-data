The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`, but it does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` remains as it was, based on the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `ans` is the accumulated sum based on the original value of `n` while iterating through the loop, `h` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50**.
