Postcondition: ***`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length h, `direction` is the second character in the path. If `direction` is '0', `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`. Otherwise, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.***
