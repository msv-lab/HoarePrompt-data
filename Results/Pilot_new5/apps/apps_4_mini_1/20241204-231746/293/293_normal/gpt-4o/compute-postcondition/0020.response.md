The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 4, so the new value will be 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is now 5, `path` is a binary string of length h with at least 4 characters, `direction` is the fourth character in `path`.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string of length h with at least 4 characters, `direction` is the fourth character in `path.**
