The code snippet provided modifies the value of `current_node` based on its previous value. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `current_node`, so we will keep it as is. 

Since `current_node` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, I will represent it as a variable. 

The value of `current_node` will now be calculated as `2 * current_node + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string of length h with at least 4 characters, `direction` is the fourth character in `path`, and `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.**
