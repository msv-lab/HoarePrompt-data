`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `visited_count` is 2, so after the code execution, `visited_count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length h, `direction` is the second character in the path.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length h, `direction` is the second character in the path.**
