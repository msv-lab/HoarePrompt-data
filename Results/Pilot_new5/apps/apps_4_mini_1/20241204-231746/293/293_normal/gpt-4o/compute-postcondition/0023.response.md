Postcondition: ***`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string of length h with at least 4 characters, and `direction` is the fourth character in `path`. If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`. Otherwise, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2.***
