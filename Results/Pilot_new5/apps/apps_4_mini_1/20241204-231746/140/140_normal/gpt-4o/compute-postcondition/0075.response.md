Since `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables (`in_degree`, `queue`, `n`, `node`, `graph`, and `neighbor`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors, `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is now decreased by 1.**
