The command `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The state of `in_degree` and `count` is unaffected by this operation, but it is important to mention that `queue` now contains an additional element, which is the `neighbor`. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees reflecting `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` has neighbors in the graph, `count` is incremented by 1, and `queue` now includes `neighbor`.**
