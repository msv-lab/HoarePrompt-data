The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`, which means the queue now contains all its previous elements plus the `neighbor`. The values of `in_degree`, `n`, `node`, and `graph[node]` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` now includes `neighbor`, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors.**
