`neighbor` is appended to `queue`, which means the queue now includes this new element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` now contains one additional element (`neighbor`), `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.
