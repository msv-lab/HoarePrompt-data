The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables `in_degree`, `n`, `queue`, and `node` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, `n` is the total number of vertices, `queue` contains vertices with in-degrees of 0 excluding the vertex that was removed, `node` is the vertex that was removed from `queue`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, `n` is the total number of vertices, `queue` contains vertices with in-degrees of 0 excluding the vertex that was removed, `node` is the vertex that was removed from `queue`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
