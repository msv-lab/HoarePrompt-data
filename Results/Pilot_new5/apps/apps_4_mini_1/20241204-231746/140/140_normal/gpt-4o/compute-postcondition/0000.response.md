The dictionary `in_degree` is created with keys representing each vertex from 1 to `n`, and each key is assigned a value of `0`. The initial state indicates that `n` is at least 2, which means `in_degree` will contain at least two keys (1 and 2). The states of the graph and `n` remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from those vertices; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to n has a value of 0.**
