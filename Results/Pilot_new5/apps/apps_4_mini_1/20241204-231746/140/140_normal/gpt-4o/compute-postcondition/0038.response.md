The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the variable `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor` appended to its previous values, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in the graph with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`.**
