You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of tuples representing directed edges, visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of boolean values indicating the vertices currently in the recursion stack.
```
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the node has been successfully processed with its neighbor and is part of a valid exploration in the graph.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating that there is a cycle involving the 'neighbor' node in the graph as both 'visited[neighbor]' and 'rec_stack[neighbor]' are True

Case_3: The program returns True, indicating that the current node has been successfully visited and is part of the recursion stack in the graph traversal

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph or has been successfully visited

Case_5: The program returns True, indicating that the node has been visited and is currently in the recursion stack, confirming its presence in the graph's traversal.

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating that 'node' is currently being processed and it has at least one neighbor in the 'graph' that has been visited.

Case_7: The program returns False, indicating that there is no cycle detected in the graph for the given node

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
