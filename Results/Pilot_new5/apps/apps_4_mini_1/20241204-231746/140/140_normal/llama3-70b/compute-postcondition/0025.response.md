The value of `rec_stack[node]` is assigned to `False`. The previous state indicates that `rec_stack[node]` was `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is False, `visited[neighbor]` is True for all neighbors processed, and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True for any neighbor that is part of a cycle; if no cycles are found `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False for those neighbors.

Output State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is False, `visited[neighbor]` is True for all neighbors processed, `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True for any neighbor that is part of a cycle, if no cycles are found `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False for those neighbors.**
