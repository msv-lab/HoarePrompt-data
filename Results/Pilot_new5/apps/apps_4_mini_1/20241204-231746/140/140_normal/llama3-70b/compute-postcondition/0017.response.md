Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, and `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, the function calls `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)`, indicating that the current node has been successfully visited and is part of the recursion stack. If `visited[neighbor]` is True and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph or has been successfully visited. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, no result is returned.***
