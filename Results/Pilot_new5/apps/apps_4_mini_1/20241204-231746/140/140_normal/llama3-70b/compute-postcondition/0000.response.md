The code sets the `visited` status of the `node` to `True`. This updates the `visited` list to indicate that the current vertex has been visited. The states of the other variables (`graph`, `rec_stack`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating the vertices currently in the recursion stack.**
