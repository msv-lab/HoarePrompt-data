According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 3 (since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i - 1`).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 2**
