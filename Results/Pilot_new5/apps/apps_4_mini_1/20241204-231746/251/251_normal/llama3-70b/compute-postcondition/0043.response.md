According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, and given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` will also be at least 2 or more. Therefore, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0. Thus, the states need to reflect that `j` is starting from 0 and will be incremented during each iteration until it reaches `i`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`, and `dp[i]` remains unchanged for other indices**
