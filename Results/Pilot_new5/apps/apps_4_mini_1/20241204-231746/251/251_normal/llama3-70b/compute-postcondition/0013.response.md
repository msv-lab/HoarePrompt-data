The variable `dp` is initialized as a list containing `n` zeros, where `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100,000. The states of the other variables, including the `cakes` list, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` contains `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element `(math.pi * r * r * h), r, h` for each input pair of `(r, h)`; `dp` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros.
