The `print` statement outputs the formatted value of `result` to six decimal places. Since `result` is assigned the output of `func_1(n, cakes)` and its value is not specified in the initial state, it remains unknown. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `data` is a list of strings; `cakes` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples derived from `data`; `result` is the output of `func_1(n, cakes)` printed to six decimal places.**
