According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, and the loop has iterated through all values of `j` less than `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Thus, `j` will be able to take on new values, specifically `j` will now iterate from `0` to `i` (which is one less than the new `i`).

So, to prepare for the next execution:
- `i` must be increased by 1 to `i + 1`.
- The range for `j` will then cover from `0` to `i` (which is `i + 1 - 1` due to Python's `range` function).

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `volumes[j]` must be less than `volumes[i + 1]`, `i` is now `i + 1`**
