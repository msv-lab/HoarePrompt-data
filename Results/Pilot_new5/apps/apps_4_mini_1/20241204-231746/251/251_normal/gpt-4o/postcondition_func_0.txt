The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes` where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes that can be formed by stacking cakes with strictly increasing volumes. If no cakes are provided or if `n` is 0, the function will return 0, since the maximum volume sum would be zero in that case.
