In this code snippet, `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The value of `i` was incremented by 1 prior to this code execution, and since `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` must have been less than `n - 2`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.

The variable `b` will now hold the value `b + a[i]`, where `a[i]` is within the range of -100 to 100 as defined in the initial state. The variable `c` is also updated based on the new value of `i`, but its specific new value isn't given by the snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` is updated accordingly based on the new `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`**.
