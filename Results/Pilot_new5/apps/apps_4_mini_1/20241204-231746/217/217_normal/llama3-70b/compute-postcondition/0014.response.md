According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has just been incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Since it is given that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `i + 2` after the current increment.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` can be updated or set to 0 depending on the parity of the new `i`, `c` is updated accordingly based on the new `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`**
