Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or less, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed; `a` contains all the values of `x` collected during each iteration, where each `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` at that time. The original value of `n` must have been sufficient to allow the loop to execute until `i` reached its final value. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
