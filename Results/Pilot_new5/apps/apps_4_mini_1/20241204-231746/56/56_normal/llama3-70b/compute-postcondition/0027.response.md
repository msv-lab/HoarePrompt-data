The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The value of `n` remains greater than 0 (specifically, `n` is equal to its previous value minus `2`). Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1**
