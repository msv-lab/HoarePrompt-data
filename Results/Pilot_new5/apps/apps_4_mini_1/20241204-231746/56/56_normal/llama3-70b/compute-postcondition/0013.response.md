The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the value of `n` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is a positive integer resulting from `n = old_n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer resulting from the operation `n = old_n - 2`; `i` is increased by 1.**
