According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, which guarantees that `n` is positive. Thus, there is no need to adjust `n` for the loop to execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted either.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
