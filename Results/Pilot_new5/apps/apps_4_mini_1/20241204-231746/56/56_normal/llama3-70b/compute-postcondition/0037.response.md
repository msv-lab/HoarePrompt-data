Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than `k`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `a` contains all the values of `x` collected during each iteration (where each `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` at that time), and if the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. If the length of `a` is equal to or greater than `k`, 'Yes' is printed, `a` is sorted in reverse order, and the output is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.***
