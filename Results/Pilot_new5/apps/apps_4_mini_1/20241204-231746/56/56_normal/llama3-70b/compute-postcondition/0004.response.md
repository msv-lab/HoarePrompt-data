The code initializes the list `a` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State retains the information about `n` and `k` while noting that `a` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list.**
