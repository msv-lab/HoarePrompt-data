The function reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from input. It first checks if `n` is less than `k`, printing 'No' if so. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it collects values of `x` (where `x` is determined by the bit length of `n`) until `n` becomes zero or the loop conditions are no longer met. If the number of collected values is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. If there are at least `k` values, it sorts them in descending order, prints 'Yes', and outputs the first `k` values as a space-separated string. The function does not return any values; it only produces print outputs.
