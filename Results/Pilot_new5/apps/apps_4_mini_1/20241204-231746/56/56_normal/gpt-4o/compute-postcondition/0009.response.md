The code `bits.append(i)` adds the value of `i`, which is 59, to the `bits` list. The previous state of `bits` is not specified, but it will now include the value 59. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 59, and if the bit at position 60 of `n` is set, then the variable `bits` contains the value 60 and 59 is appended to `bits`.**
