Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n` (from 0 to 60). The length of `bits` is greater than `k`.***
