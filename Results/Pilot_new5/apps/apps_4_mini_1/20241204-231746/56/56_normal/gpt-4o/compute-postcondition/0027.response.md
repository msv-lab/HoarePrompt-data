`smallest` is assigned the value of the last element in `bits` before it is removed from the list `bits`. The list `bits` is now one element shorter, and the last element has been removed from it. The conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `len(bits)`, and the initial state of `smallest` before the code execution will still hold true, except for the changes to `smallest` and `bits`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `len(bits)` is less than `k`, `smallest` is the last element that was in `bits` before it was popped, and `bits` has one less element than before.**
