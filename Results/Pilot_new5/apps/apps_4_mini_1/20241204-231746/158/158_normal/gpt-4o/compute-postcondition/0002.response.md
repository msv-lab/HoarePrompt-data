The value of `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `b` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `b` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `c` is an input integer.**
