The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with values between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function does not specify any output in the provided information, hence we cannot determine the return value based on the given constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that represent quantities of fruits within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, with values between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
