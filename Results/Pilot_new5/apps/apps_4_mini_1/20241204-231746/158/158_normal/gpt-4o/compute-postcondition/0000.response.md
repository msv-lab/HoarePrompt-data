The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` will accept an integer input from the user. Since `a` is a positive integer representing the number of lemons with values between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `a` will now have the specific integer value provided by the input, while the values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
