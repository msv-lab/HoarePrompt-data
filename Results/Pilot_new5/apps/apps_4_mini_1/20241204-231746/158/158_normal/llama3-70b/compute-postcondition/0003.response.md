`min_lemon` is assigned the value of the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged but are used to compute `min_lemon`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the computation of `min_lemon` without changing the input integers.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
