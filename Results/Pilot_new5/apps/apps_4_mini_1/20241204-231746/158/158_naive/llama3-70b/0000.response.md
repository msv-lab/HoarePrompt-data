To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem states that Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears, and they need to be combined in the ratio of 1:2:4 for compote. The goal is to calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used based on the available quantities while maintaining the required ratio.

The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the ratios:
   - The number of lemons is limited by `a`.
   - The number of apples is limited by `b // 2` (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
   - The number of pears is limited by `c // 4` (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. It finds the minimum of these three values (`min_lemon`), which represents the maximum number of lemon sets that can be used.
4. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of fruits in these sets: `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
- If Nikolay has 0 lemons, apples, or pears (although the problem states 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000, it's worth checking if the logic handles edge cases properly).
- The case where one type of fruit is not enough to form a single set. 

#### Example Cases:
1. **Input:** 
   ```
   1
   2
   4
   ```
   - Output should be `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. The program correctly returns `7`.

2. **Input:** 
   ```
   1
   3
   1
   ```
   - Here, we can use 1 lemon, but we can't use enough apples or pears. The output should be `0`. The program would return `0` since `min_lemon` would be 0.

3. **Input:** 
   ```
   2
   5
   7
   ```
   - The maximum sets that can be formed is `1` (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). The output should be `7`. The program returns `7`, which is correct.

4. **Input:** 
   ```
   4
   7
   13
   ```
   - The maximum sets that can be formed is `3` (3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears). The output should be `21`. The program returns `21`, which is correct.

5. **Input:** 
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   - In this case, we can't make a single complete set because there are not enough pears. The output should be `0`, and the program correctly returns `0`.

### Conclusion:
After thorough analysis of the program with the specified examples and potential edge cases, the program handles all cases correctly according to the problem’s requirements. 

Correctness: **True**.
