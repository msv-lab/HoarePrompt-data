The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from user input, and calculates the maximum value of `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and the remaining amounts can together satisfy `x`. It prints this value of `x`, with the understanding that it should not allow `x` to become negative due to the constraints provided.
