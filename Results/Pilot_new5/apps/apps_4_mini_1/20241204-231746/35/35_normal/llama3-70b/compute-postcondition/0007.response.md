According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute again unless there's a break statement or an external interruption. Since the condition is always true, the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing any adjustments to the states.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1.**
