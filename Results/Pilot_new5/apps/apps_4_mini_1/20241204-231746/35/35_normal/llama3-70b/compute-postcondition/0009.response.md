Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `a - x + (b - x) is greater than or equal to x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
