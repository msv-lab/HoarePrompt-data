The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The variable `mid` is unchanged by the operation, and the relationship `low < high` still holds. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `high` will now be equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2.**
