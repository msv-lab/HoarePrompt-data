The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which represents the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` must be less than `high`, the result of this operation will always be a valid midpoint value between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
