The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is a positive integer that represents the number of pieces each plate must contain. Additionally, the function utilizes two other positive integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of two cakes, and a positive integer `n`, which satisfies the condition \(2 \leq n \leq (a + b)\). After executing the function body, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of plates that can be filled with the pieces from both cakes, calculated as \(a // x + b // x\), is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept a positive integer `x` and determine if the available cake pieces can be distributed into plates with the specified number of pieces while meeting the required plate count.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, a positive integer representing the number of pieces each plate must contain, and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to fill at least n plates with the pieces from two cakes of sizes a and b.**
