The variable `a4` is assigned the value of `(x ** z) ** y`. Given that `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, `a4` will result in a positive real number as well. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `(x ** z) ** y`.**
