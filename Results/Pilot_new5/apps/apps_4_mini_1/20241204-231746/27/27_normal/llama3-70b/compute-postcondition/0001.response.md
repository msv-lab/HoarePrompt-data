The value of `a1` is assigned the result of `x ** (y ** z)`. Given that `x`, `y`, and `z` are input positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, inclusive, and each has exactly one digit after the decimal point, the value of `a1` will be a specific positive real number based on the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, inclusive, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `a1` is equal to `x ** (y ** z)`.**
