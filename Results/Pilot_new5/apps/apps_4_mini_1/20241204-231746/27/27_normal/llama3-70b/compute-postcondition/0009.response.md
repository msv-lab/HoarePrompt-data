The variable `a9` is assigned the value of `z` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `y`. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, the value of `a9` will be a positive real number as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `y`; `a9` is equal to `z` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `y`.**
