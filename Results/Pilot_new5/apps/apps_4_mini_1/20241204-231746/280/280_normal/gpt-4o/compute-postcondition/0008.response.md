To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the operation within the context of the initial state.

Initial State: `speeds[1]` is updated, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2

The code snippet is:
```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

1. **Understanding the code**: 
   - The value of `speeds[i]` will be set to the lesser of two values.
   - The first value is `speeds[i - 1] + d`, which means it will add `d` to the value at `speeds[1]`.
   - The second value is `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which incorporates the variables `v2`, `t`, and `d`.

2. **Values involved**:
   - Since `i` is 2, we are working with `speeds[2]`.
   - `t` is greater than 2, which implies that `t - i - 1` will be positive (since `t` can be at least 3).

3. **Calculating the minimum**:
   - The first value becomes `speeds[1] + d`.
   - The second value becomes `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, given that `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, `speeds[2]` will be assigned the minimum of these two computed values.

The other variables in the initial state, namely `speeds[1]`, `d`, and `v2`, remain unchanged, but `speeds[2]` is updated based on the calculations.

Output State: **`speeds[1]` is updated, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `speeds[2]` is assigned the value of min(`speeds[1] + d`, `v2 + (t - 3) * d`)**.
