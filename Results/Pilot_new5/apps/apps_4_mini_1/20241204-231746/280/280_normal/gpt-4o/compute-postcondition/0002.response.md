The variable `speeds` is assigned a list of length `t`, where each element is initialized to `0`. The value of `t` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), so `speeds` will contain `t` elements all set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive); `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive); `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros.**
