The function accepts four integers: `v1` and `v2` (both between 1 and 100 inclusive), `t` (between 2 and 100 inclusive), and `d` (between 0 and 10 inclusive). It computes a list of speeds based on the provided formula, starting with `v1` and ending with `v2`, while ensuring that speeds do not exceed the calculated maximum speed at each step. The function then sums these speeds and prints the total distance traveled. It does not return any value.
