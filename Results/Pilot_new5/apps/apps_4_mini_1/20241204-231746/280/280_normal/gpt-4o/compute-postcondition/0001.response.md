The values of `t` and `d` are assigned based on the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input values into integers. The initial state indicates that `t` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `d` is between 0 and 10 (inclusive). After the code executes, `t` and `d` will be updated to the integers provided by the user input. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers based on the input; `t` is the user input integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is the user input integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive).**
