To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

**Initial State:**
- `v_1` is an integer based on the input.
- `v_2` is an integer based on the input.
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive).
- `speeds[0]` equals `v_1`.
- `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are still zeros.
- `speeds[t-1]` equals `v_2`.
- `i` is 1.

**Code Execution:**
```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```
In this line:
- `speeds[i - 1]` equals `speeds[0]`, which is `v_1`.
- Therefore, `speeds[i - 1] + d` equals `v_1 + d`.
- `t - i - 1` equals `t - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `t - 2`. Thus, `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d` becomes `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`.

Now, `speeds[1]` will be assigned the minimum of the two values calculated above:
- `speeds[1] = min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`

**Output State:**
The state of other variables remains unchanged, and we update `speeds[1]` based on the computation.
Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`v_1` is an integer based on the input, `v_2` is an integer based on the input, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), `speeds[0]` equals `v_1`, `speeds[1]` equals `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` to `speeds[t-2]` are still zeros, `speeds[t-1]` equals `v_2`, `i` is 1**.
