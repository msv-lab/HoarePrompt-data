According to the code, the for loop is defined to iterate starting from `i = 1` and going up to `i < t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 2 since the range of the loop is `range(1, t)`, which means at least one iteration will occur when `t` is 2 or greater.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `t - 1`. The variables `v_1` and `v_2` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they determine the values in `speeds`. The state of `speeds` at the start of the loop indicates that `speeds[0]` is `v_1` and `speeds[t-1]` is `v_2`, which are already defined.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, the state must reflect that `t` is at least 2, `i` must start at 1, and the initial values of `speeds` are already defined correctly as per the given state.

State: **`v_1` is an integer based on the input, `v_2` is an integer based on the input, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), `speeds[0]` equals `v_1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are still zeros, `speeds[t-1]` equals `v_2`, `i` is 1**
