The code snippet `min_length += min_speed` updates the value of `min_length` by adding the current value of `min_speed` to it. The other variables retain their previous states.

1. **`min_length`** is updated to `min_length + min_speed`. Thus, after execution, `min_length` will be equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`.
2. The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `i`, `min_speed`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state reflects the new value of `min_length` but retains the definitions of the other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 1`, and `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
