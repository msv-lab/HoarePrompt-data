The code `max_length += max_speed` will add the current value of `max_speed` to `max_length`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the previous value of `max_length` is updated to be equal to its previous value plus the current value of `max_speed`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is now equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`.**
