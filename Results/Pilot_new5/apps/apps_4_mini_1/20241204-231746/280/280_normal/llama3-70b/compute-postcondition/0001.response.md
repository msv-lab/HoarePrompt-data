After analyzing the provided code, the variables `t` and `d` are assigned values based on the input. The specific values of `t` and `d` are determined by the input provided at runtime. The states of `v_1`, `v_2`, and any other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second.**
