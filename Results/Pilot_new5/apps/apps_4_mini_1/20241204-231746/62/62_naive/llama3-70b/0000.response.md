Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases as described in the problem statement. 

1. It reads the input values for the two numbers along with their respective bases.
2. It defines a function `func_1` which takes the list of digits and the base as input and converts the number from that base to decimal correctly.
3. It compares the two decimal values and prints '<', '>', or '=' based on their relationship, which satisfies all the requirements.

The function `func_1` processes each digit correctly, ensuring that the conversion from the specified base to decimal works for all valid inputs within the given constraints. The program handles edge cases, such as different lengths of numbers in different bases, since the conversion ensures that they are correctly processed regardless of their length.

Overall, the implementation is robust and adheres to the problem description, so I find no case where it fails to meet the requirements.
