Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input format, capturing the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` effectively converts a number represented by a list of digits from a specified base into its decimal equivalent. It multiplies the current result by the base and adds the digit in each iteration, thereby constructing the decimal representation correctly.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program uses standard comparison operators to determine if X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y. It prints the correct symbols ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison.

4. **Constraints and Edge Cases**: The code adheres to the constraints provided in the problem, ensuring that base values are within the specified ranges and that there are no leading zeroes or invalid digits based on the bases. 

Since the program correctly handles all specified inputs and outputs the expected results for the provided examples, as well as adheres to the constraints outlined in the problem description, it can be confidently assessed as correct.

Overall, I could not identify any potential input case where the program would fail to meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness assessment is True.
