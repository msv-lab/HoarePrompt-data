To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the code and identify any potential edge cases.

The code is designed to:
1. Read the number of digits and the base for two numbers (X and Y).
2. Read the digits of each number in their respective bases.
3. Convert each number from its base representation to decimal.
4. Compare the two decimal values and print the appropriate comparison operator ('<', '>', or '=').

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for bases and digits.
2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` converts a base-n number represented by a list of digits into its decimal equivalent. It does this well through an iterative process, ensuring that it multiplies the current decimal value by the base before adding the next digit.
3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, it compares the two decimal values correctly.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: The smallest inputs (e.g., X=1 in base 2 and Y=1 in base 3) should yield '='.
2. **Maximum Base Values**: The program should handle bases up to 40 correctly.
3. **Different Lengths**: It should handle cases where one number has more digits than the other correctly.
4. **Digits at Limit**: Ensure that digits are valid (i.e., less than their respective bases).

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40), the program logically handles number representations without leading zeroes, as this is guaranteed by the problem statement.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- If we test with inputs that are at the limits, such as:
  - X = `9` in base 10, Y = `10` in base 11.
  - X = `3` in base 4, Y = `2` in base 5.
  
In all these cases, the program handles the input correctly and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases and potential inputs, it appears that the program handles all described scenarios adequately.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly converts the base representations to decimal and compares them as per the problem requirements.
