Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down how it meets each requirement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input format, where it first captures the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y. It uses `map(int, input().split())` to convert the inputs into the appropriate integer values.

2. **Digit Representation**: The digits of both numbers are read as lists of integers. The program ensures that the digits are processed in the correct order (most significant to least significant), which is crucial for correctly converting the base representation to decimal.

3. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is implemented to convert a number from its base representation to decimal. It iterates through the `digits` list and calculates the decimal value based on the given base. This implementation adheres to the mathematical principle of converting from any base to decimal, which is essential for comparing the two numbers.

4. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal representations of both numbers, the program uses standard conditional statements to compare the two decimal values. It outputs '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison, which aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program accommodates the constraints provided (e.g., valid digit ranges, non-leading zeros, and differing bases) by design. It handles all possible valid inputs as specified (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40) without violating any of the constraints.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem’s requirements and will correctly handle all specified cases, thus confirming its correctness.
