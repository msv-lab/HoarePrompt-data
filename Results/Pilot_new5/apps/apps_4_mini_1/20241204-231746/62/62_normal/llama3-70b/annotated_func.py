#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, base is an integer representing the base in which the number is expressed, where 1 ≤ len(digits) ≤ 10, 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, and all digits are non-negative integers less than base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, `base` is an integer, `result` is the integer represented by `digits` in base `base`.
    return result
    #The program returns the integer represented by the list of digits in the specified base, where 'result' is that integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base`, representing the base in which the number is expressed. It computes and returns the integer equivalent of the digit list in the specified base. The function assumes that all digits are valid for the given base, meaning they are non-negative integers less than the base, and handles only valid inputs as per the annotations. If invalid inputs are provided, the function does not include error handling for such cases.
