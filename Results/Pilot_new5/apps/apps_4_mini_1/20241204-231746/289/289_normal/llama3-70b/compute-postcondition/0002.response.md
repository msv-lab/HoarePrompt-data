The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle a positive integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. However, since the function does not take `n` as an input parameter, the specific behavior of the function in relation to `n` is not directly described in the provided information. 

Therefore, without additional context regarding what the function does with `n` or how it is determined, we cannot provide further details on the output. The functionality of the function is currently undefined based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified.**
