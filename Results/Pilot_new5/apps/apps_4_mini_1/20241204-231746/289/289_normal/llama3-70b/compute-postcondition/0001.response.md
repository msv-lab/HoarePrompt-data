The code `print(n.bit_length() - 1)` calculates the bit length of the integer `n` and then subtracts 1 from that value. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the bit length of `n` indicates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary.

The output of `n.bit_length()` will be the number of bits needed to represent `n`. By subtracting 1 from this bit length, we get the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. 

Thus, after running the code, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the result that would be printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; the output of the statement is `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
