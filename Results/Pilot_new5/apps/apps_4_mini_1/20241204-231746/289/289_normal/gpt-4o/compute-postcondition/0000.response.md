Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the assignment `n = int(input())` indicates that the value of `n` will be replaced by the integer input provided by the user. The exact value of `n` after this code execution is dependent on the user's input, but it remains within the bounds of a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\).

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\**.
