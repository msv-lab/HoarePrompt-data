Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string as specified in the problem description. Instead, it counts the number of distinct adjacent characters in the string `s`, which does not correspond to the number of operations needed to fully delete the string.

To illustrate why the program fails:
1. The problem states that you can delete contiguous substrings where all characters are the same. The minimal number of operations depends on the arrangement of characters and their groupings rather than just counting distinct adjacent characters.
2. For example, in the string `abaca`, the correct approach would result in 3 operations: delete 'a', then 'b', and finally 'ca' (each consisting of contiguous characters). However, the program would simply count the transitions between 'a', 'b', and 'c' to yield an incorrect output of 4 (since it counts the transitions as operations).
3. The program doesn't consider the potential to delete larger contiguous groups of the same character, which is crucial for minimizing the number of operations.

Therefore, the implementation does not adhere to the specified requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
