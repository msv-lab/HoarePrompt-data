Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings consisting of equal letters. 

The program, however, counts the number of distinct groups of adjacent characters in the string. Specifically, it increments `ans` every time it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. This logic does not translate to the minimum number of operations required to completely delete the string.

For example, consider the string "abaca":
- The program will count 5 groups (`a`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `a`).
- The output will be 5, which does not represent the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string (the correct answer should be 3 because you can remove 'aaa' in one operation, 'c' in another, and 'b' in a third).

Thus, the logic fails to correctly implement the solution as required by the problem description.
