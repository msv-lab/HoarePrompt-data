To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop, we first analyze how the loop modifies the `ans` variable based on the comparisons between adjacent characters in the string `s`. 

1. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
2. For each iteration, it checks if the character at the current index `i` is different from the character at the previous index `i - 1`. 
3. If they are different, `ans` is incremented by 1.

Given the constraints that `n` is between 1 and 500 and `s` is a string of length `n`, we can summarize the following states based on the output after the loop executes fully:

- If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 1.
- For `n` greater than 1, `ans` will be equal to the count of distinct adjacent characters in `s`. 
- The maximum value of `ans` occurs when all characters of `s` are different, which would result in `ans` being equal to `n` (the original value of `ans` incremented by `n-1`).

Thus, we can conclude that after the loop executes:

Output State: **`s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is equal to the number of distinct adjacent characters in `s`, and `n` is between 1 and 500.**
