Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string `s`. 

The logic implemented in the code counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` and adds 1 to that count, which does not represent the correct number of operations required. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
5
aaabb
```
The expected output is `2` because you can perform:
1. Delete "aaa" in the first operation.
2. Delete "bb" in the second operation.

However, the code would calculate the number of operations as follows:
- `ans` starts at 1.
- It detects that `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]` (both 'a'), so it doesn't increment `ans`.
- It detects that `s[2]` is different from `s[1]`, so it increments `ans` to 2.
- It detects that `s[3]` is different from `s[2]`, so it increments `ans` to 3.
- The final output would be `3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem, leading to a verdict of correctness being **False**.
