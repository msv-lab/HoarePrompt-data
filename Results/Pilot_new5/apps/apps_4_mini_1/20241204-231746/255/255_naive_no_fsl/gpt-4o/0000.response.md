Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of operations to delete the string as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of contiguous segments of different characters in the string, which does not reflect the minimum operations needed to delete the entire string.

To illustrate this, consider the input:

```
5
aaaaa
```

In this case, the string consists entirely of the same character ('a'). According to the problem description, we can delete the entire string in a single operation since all characters are equal. Therefore, the expected output should be `1`.

However, the provided program would output `1` as well, but consider another input:

```
6
aaabbb
```

In this case, the string can be deleted in two operations: first deleting 'aaa' and then deleting 'bbb'. The expected output is `2`. 

The program counts the transitions between different characters and would return `3`, since it increments for each change from 'a' to 'b'. Thus, it fails to account for the fact that contiguous equal characters can be deleted in a single operation.

Another example:

```
7
abbbccaa
```

In this case, the operations can be done as follows:
1. Delete 'bbb' -> remaining string is 'acaa'
2. Delete 'aa' -> remaining string is 'c'
3. Delete 'c' -> string is empty.

The expected output is `3`, but the program would incorrectly calculate it as `5`.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly implement the logic as required, we conclude that it is incorrect.
