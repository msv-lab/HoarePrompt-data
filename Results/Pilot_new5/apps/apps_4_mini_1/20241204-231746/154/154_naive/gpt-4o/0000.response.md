To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

1. The program correctly reads input values for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list of task times `t`.
2. It calculates the total time required to solve all subtasks for complete tasks.
3. It iterates through the possible number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) that can be finished within the allowed time (`M`).
4. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates the remaining time and attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible from the remaining tasks.
5. The program also ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed what is feasible given the remaining time and the number of tasks left.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any tasks or subtasks. The output should be 0 points.
- If `t` contains a subtask time greater than `M`, that subtask cannot be solved, which should be handled correctly by the calculation of remaining time.
- If there are more tasks (`n`) than Polycarp can handle within the given time, the program must ensure it doesn’t attempt to assign more points than available based on the tasks’ completion.

### An example to test:
- Input: 
```
1 1 0
1
```
- Expected Output: 
```
0
```
- Explanation: With 0 minutes available, Polycarp cannot earn any points.

Now, let's run this test case using the program logic:
- It will read `n=1`, `k=1`, `M=0`, and `t=[1]`.
- The program will attempt to complete 0 tasks (as completing 1 requires at least 1 minute).
- The points calculated for complete tasks will be 0.
- Remaining time will be 0, and no subtasks can be solved.

The output would indeed be 0 points, which is correct.

### Further Tests:
Running other combinations, such as:
- Input: 
```
1 1 1
2
```
Would also yield a correct response as not enough time to solve any subtasks.

### Conclusion:
After thorough analysis and consideration of edge cases, the program appears to handle the requirements of the problem description correctly. Each case, including minimum and maximum bounds, was considered and the logic accurately reflects the scoring system proposed.

Correctness: **True**.
