Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 45. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to the remainder of `remaining_time` when divided by `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, and `t` remains a non-empty iterable.***
