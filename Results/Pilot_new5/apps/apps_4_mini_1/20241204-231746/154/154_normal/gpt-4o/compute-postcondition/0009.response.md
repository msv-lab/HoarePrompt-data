The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. This does not change any of the previously established conditions or values of other variables, so all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M`, and `subtasks_solved` is 0.
