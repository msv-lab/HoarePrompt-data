The variable `total_time_per_task` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `t`, which contains `k` positive integers. The value of `total_time_per_task` will depend on the specific values in the list `t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`.**
