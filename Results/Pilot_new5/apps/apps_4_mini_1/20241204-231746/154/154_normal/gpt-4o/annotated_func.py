#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, and t is a list of k positive integers where each integer t[j] is such that 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is the maximum points achievable given the constraints; if the loop does not execute, `max_points` remains 0.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is the maximum points achievable given the constraints, where complete_tasks is equal to n and total_time_per_task is the sum of the elements in t. If the loop does not execute, max_points remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` positive integers. It calculates the maximum points that can be achieved by completing up to `n` tasks within a time limit `M`. Each completed task grants `k + 1` points, and additional points can be gained by solving subtasks if time permits, limited by the number of remaining tasks. If no tasks can be completed within the time limit, the function returns 0.
