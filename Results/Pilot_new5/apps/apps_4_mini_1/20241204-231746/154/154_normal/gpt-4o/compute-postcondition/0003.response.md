The variable `time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. The value of `complete_tasks` is initially 0, which means that `time_used` will also be 0 regardless of the value of `total_time_per_task`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0.**
