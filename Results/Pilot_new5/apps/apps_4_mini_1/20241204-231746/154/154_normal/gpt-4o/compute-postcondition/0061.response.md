The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged and are still valid after the execution. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` where `complete_tasks` has been updated to `complete_tasks + 1; remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used; `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
