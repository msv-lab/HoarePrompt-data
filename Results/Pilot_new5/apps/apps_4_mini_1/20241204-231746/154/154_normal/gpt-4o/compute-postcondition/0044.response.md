The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is determined by the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, which implies the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved in the given remaining time. The variable `subtasks_solved` is then incremented by this value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`; `remaining_time` is greater than 0; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**.
