The `subtasks_solved` variable is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The values of `remaining_time` and `subtask_time` are based on the previously defined variables. 

1. `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`.
2. `subtask_time` is equal to the first element of the list `t`.
3. `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Thus, the output state updates `subtasks_solved` by adding `max_subtasks_for_this_task` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, `points` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is equal to M - (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, `subtasks_solved` is updated to `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `t` is a list containing at least one element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
