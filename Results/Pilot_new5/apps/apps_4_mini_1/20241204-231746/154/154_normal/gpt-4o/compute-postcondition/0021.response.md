According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be a valid `subtask_time` from the list `t` that can be used for the next iteration. Since `t` contains `k` positive integers, if the previous iteration used `t[j]`, then the next `subtask_time` will be `t[j+1]` if `j < k - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, if `complete_tasks` is incremented, that means tasks have been solved based on `subtask_time`. The loop needs to ensure that `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, if the last `subtask_time` used was `t[j]`, we need to prepare for `subtask_time` to be `t[j + 1]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `k - 1`.

So the adjustments needed for the next iteration are:
- `subtask_time` should be set to the next element in the list `t`, which is `t[j + 1]`.
- We also need to ensure that `remaining_time` is still sufficient for the next subtask, so `remaining_time` must remain greater than or equal to `t[j + 1]` to proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j + 1]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j + 1]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is incremented by 1; `time_used` is the same as before; `remaining_time` must be greater than or equal to `t[j + 1]`**
