Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45. If the remaining time is greater than or equal to the subtask time, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, `points` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is reduced by the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that fits within the original remaining time, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to (original remaining_time // subtask_time).***
