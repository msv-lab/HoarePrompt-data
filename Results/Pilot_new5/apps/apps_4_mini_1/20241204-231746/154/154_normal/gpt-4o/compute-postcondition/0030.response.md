The variable `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, which means `complete_tasks` increases by 1. The variable `time_used` is then calculated as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. 

Since `complete_tasks` is now `complete_tasks + 1`, the new value of `time_used` will be `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`. 

The state of the other variables (`n` and `k`) remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to complete_tasks + 1, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task**.
