Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is 0; `time_used` is 0; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is equal to `t[j]`, and `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
