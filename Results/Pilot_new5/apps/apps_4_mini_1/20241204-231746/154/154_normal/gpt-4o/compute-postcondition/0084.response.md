Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` positive integers. It calculates the maximum points that can be achieved by completing up to `n` tasks within a time limit `M`. Each completed task grants `k + 1` points, and additional points can be gained by solving subtasks if time permits, limited by the number of remaining tasks. If no tasks can be completed within the time limit, the function returns 0. **
