The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `i` is `k + 1` and `j` is `1`, the assignment takes place at that specific index of the `dp` array. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the existing `dp` values remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
