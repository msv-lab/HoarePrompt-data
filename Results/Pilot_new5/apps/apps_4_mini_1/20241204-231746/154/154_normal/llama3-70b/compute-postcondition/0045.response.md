The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` indicates that the value at the index `[i][j]` of the `dp` array is being assigned the value at the index `[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `k + 1` and `j` is `3`, the value of `dp[k + 1][3]` is now equal to `dp[k + 1][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` must be greater than or equal to 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3, `dp[k + 1][3]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][2]`.**
