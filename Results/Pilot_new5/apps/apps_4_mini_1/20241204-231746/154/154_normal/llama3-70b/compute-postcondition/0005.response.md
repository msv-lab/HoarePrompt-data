According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will execute if `M` is at least 1 because the range starts at 1 and goes up to `M`. The provided state indicates that `M` is a non-negative integer, but it does not specify its value, so we must ensure that `M` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which does not need adjustment for the loop. However, we need to ensure that the other conditions are satisfied.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `M` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of k integers, `dp` is a list of k + 1 lists each containing M + 1 zeros, `i` is 1**
