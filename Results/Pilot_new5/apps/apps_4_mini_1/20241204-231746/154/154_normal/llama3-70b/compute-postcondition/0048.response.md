Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `M`, and `dp[k + 1][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[k][j - t[k]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[k]`. If the loop does not execute, `j` will be 1, and the values of `dp[i][1]` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
