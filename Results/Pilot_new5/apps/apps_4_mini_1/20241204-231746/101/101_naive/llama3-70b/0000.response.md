To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of the pixels.
   
2. **Identifying White Pixels**: 
   - It gathers all coordinates of white pixels ('w') in the input, which is required for further calculations.

3. **Finding Frame Bounds**: 
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which helps in determining the frame's bounding box.

4. **Calculating Frame Size**: 
   - It computes the frame size based on the maximum distances between the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels.

5. **Frame Size Validation**: 
   - The program checks if the frame size is greater than the monitor dimensions; if so, it outputs -1, indicating the frame cannot fit.

6. **Building the Frame**:
   - The program then iterates over the entire pixel grid to build the frame by placing '+' where needed while ensuring that existing white pixels remain unchanged.

7. **Output**: 
   - Finally, it prints the modified pixel grid.

**Potential Issues**:
- The program does not handle cases when the calculated frame size does not correspond to a proper square frame that can fully encapsulate all the white pixels.
- The conditions for placing '+' characters around the frame only check if the specific rows and columns are the min or max, but if the calculated frame size is not large enough to encapsulate the entire region containing all 'w', it might lead to a situation where a proper frame cannot be drawn.

**Example Case of Failure**:
Consider a case where there are white pixels that form a diagonal line like:

```
5 5
w....
.w...
..w..
.w...
....w
```
In this case, the program will calculate the frame size based on the outermost white pixels, but the resulting frame would fail to encapsulate the diagonal relationship properly, leading to output that does not meet the requirements.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
