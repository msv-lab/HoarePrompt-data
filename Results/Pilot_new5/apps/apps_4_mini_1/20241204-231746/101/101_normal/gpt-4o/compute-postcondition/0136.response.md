The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `bottom` was also 2, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected, and since `i` is not less than `top`, we confirm that no statements in the if block were executed.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2**.
