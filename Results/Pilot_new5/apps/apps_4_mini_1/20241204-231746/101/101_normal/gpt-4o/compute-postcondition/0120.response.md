The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial value of `j` is 1. Therefore, after the code executes, both `left` and `right` become 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
