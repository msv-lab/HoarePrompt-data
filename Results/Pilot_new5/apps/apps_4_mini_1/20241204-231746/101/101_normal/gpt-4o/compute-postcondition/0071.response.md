`top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `1`, both `top` and `bottom` will now be `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
