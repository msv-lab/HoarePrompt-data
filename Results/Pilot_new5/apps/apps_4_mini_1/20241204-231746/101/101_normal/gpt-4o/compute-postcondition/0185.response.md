Postcondition: ***`top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'.***
