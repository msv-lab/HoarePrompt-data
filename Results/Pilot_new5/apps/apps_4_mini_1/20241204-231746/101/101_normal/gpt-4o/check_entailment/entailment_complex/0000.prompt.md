You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and screen is a list of strings of length m, where each string contains exactly m characters consisting of '.' for black pixels and 'w' for white pixels, with at least one 'w' present in the screen.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters; `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that there is no valid index for the 'w' characters due to at least one of the indices (top, bottom, left, right) being None.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters; `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns. None of the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` are None.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1 because frame_height is less than 2 or frame_width is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, and both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2.
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `bottom` is less than `n`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is less than `m`, and all elements `result[i][j]` on the boundary defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
    return result
    #The program returns the updated 'result' matrix where the boundary defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' has been modified with '+' in place of '.'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns), along with a list of strings `screen` representing a grid of pixels. It identifies the smallest rectangle that contains all 'w' (white pixel) characters in the grid. If no 'w' characters are found or if the rectangle formed has a height or width less than 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it modifies the boundaries of this rectangle to replace '.' (black pixels) with '+' and returns the updated grid. The function ensures that `screen` has at least one 'w' character, as guaranteed by the input conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
