The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The value of `j` is 2, so both `left` and `right` will be assigned the value of 2. The other variables are not affected.

Updating the output state, we have:
- `left` is updated to 2.
- `right` is updated to 2.

The remaining variables (`n`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and `m`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2.**
