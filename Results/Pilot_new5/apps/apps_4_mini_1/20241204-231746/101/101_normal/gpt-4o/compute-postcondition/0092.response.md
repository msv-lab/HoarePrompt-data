In the provided code snippet, `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is not specified but it remains unchanged as this line only assigns `right` the value of `j`. The other variables are unaffected by this assignment.

From the initial state, we have:
- `top` is either 1 or equal to `i` (which is 1).
- `bottom` is 1.
- `left` is equal to `j`.
- `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, but since `top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, this condition does not apply here.
- `j` is incremented by 1 (if the condition regarding `left` is satisfied, which is not specified here).
- `m` is at least 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Since `right` is now just equal to `j`, we don't change anything else.

Output State: **`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
