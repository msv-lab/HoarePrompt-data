The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so both `top` and `bottom` are now set to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `top` is 2.**
