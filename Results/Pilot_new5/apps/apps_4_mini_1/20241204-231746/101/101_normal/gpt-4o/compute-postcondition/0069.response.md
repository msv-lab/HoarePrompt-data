Postcondition: ***`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged with `n` being at least 2, `i` being 1, `m` greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w'.***
