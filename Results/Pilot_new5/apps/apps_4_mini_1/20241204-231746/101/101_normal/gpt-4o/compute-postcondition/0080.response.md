Postcondition: ***`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is less than `top`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to equal `j` after incrementing `j` by 1. Otherwise, none of the conditions result in changes.***
