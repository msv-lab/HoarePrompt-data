In the provided code snippet, both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`, which is initially `0`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code:

1. `top` is updated to `0` (the value of `i`).
2. `bottom` is updated to `0` (the value of `i`).

The initial states of `n`, `left`, `right`, `m`, and `j` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is either 1 or updated to 1 if `j` is greater than its previous value, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2.**
