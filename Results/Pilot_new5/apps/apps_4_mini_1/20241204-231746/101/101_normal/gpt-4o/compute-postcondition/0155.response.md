According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `top` and `bottom`. For the loop to execute, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`. Given that `frame_height` is defined as `bottom - top + 1`, if `frame_height` is greater than 0, it indicates there are rows to iterate over.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. Additionally, at the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `top`.

State: **`top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is `top`**
