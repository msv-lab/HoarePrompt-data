Postcondition: ***`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2 if `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None. Otherwise, if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` remains 2, `bottom` remains 2, `left` remains 0, `right` is updated to 2 if `j` is greater than `right`, otherwise all variables remain unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the variables remain unchanged.***
