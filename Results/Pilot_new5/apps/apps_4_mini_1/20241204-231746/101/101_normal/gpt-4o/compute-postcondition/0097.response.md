According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 2. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can still execute for the next iteration.

Regarding the state of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, since they are not explicitly changed within the loop and are already defined as per the previous iteration's context, we keep them unchanged.

State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters; if there are no 'w' characters in row `i`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain None, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2**
