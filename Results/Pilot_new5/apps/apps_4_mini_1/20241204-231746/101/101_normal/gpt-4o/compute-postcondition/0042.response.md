The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 2, so `left` will now be equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects the variable `left`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is either 1 or updated to 1 if `j` is greater than its previous value; `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2.**
