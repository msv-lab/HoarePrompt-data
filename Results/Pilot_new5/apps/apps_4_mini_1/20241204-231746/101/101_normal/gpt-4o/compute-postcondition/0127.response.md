`right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 1, so `right` will be updated to 1. The states of the other variables (`top`, `bottom`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `left`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 1**.
