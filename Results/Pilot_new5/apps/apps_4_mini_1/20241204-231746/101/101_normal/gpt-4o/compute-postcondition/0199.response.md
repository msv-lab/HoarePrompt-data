In the provided code snippet, `result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. We need to consider how the index variables `i` and `j` are derived from the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`
- `j` is equal to `left + 2`

Since `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, the value of `i` will be one greater than `bottom`, ensuring that `i` is always greater than `top`. 

Also, since `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` must be greater than or equal to `left + 2`, the value of `j` will be at least `left + 2`, ensuring that it is a valid index.

The specific values for `i` and `j` are determined but are not stated explicitly in the initial state. However, we can summarize their relationship to `bottom` and `left`.

Therefore, the values of `result[i][j]` get updated, but we don't have specific values for `bottom` and `left` in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is less than or equal to `bottom`; `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`; `left` is less than or equal to `right`; `j` is equal to `left + 2`; `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 2; result[i][j] is '+'**
