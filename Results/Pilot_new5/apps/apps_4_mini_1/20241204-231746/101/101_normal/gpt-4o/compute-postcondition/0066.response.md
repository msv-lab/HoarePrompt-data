The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. Since the current value of `j` is greater than `right`, this means that `right` will now hold the value of `j`, and therefore will no longer be None. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
