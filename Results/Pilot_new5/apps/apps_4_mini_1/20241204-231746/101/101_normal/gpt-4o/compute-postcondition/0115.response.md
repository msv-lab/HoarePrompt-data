Postcondition: ***`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w'. If the current value of `j` is greater than `right`, there are no changes to the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `screen[2][0]`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, there is no effect on the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `screen[2][0]`.***
