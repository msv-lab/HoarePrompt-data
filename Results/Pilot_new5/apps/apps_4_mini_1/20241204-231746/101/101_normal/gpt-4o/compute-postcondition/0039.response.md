Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is either 1 or updated to 1 if `j` is greater than its previous value; `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is less than `top`, the function proceeds with the given conditions, but since there is no else part, the values of the variables remain unchanged in that case.***
