The values of `left` and `right` are assigned the value of `j`. The initial value of `j` is 2, so both `left` and `right` will be updated to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
