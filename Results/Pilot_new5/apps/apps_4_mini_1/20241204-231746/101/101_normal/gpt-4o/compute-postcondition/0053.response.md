The variables `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` has an initial value of 1, both `top` and `bottom` will now be equal to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is None, `right` is None, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w'.
