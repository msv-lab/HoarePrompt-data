The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The initial state specifies that `right` is either 0 or None, and since `j` is 1, the value of `right` will now be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1.**
