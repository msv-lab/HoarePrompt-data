The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the definition provided. Instead, it operates on input that consists of two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing exactly `m` characters. Each character in the grid is either a '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). The function guarantees that at least one character in the input grid is 'w'.

However, since the function does not take parameters directly, we will focus on the output behavior. Based on the provided information, the function will process this grid and return some form of output based on the presence and arrangement of the characters.

Functionality: **The function processes a grid of characters defined by dimensions n and m, where characters can be either '.' (black pixel) or 'w' (white pixel), and returns a result based on the arrangement of these characters, ensuring that at least one 'w' is present in the input.**
