According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 2000, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, implying that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. As `n` is still between 1 and 2000, and since `i` (now 2) is still less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m - 1`**
