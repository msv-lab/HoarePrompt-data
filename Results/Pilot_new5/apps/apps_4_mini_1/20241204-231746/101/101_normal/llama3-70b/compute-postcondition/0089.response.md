To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior based on the initial state of the variables and the conditions defined within the loop.

Given:
- `n` is between 1 and 2000.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is equal to `m - 1` (which means `j` starts from `m - 1` and decreases with each iteration).

The loop executes for `j` in the range of `m`, which means that it will execute a total of `m` times if `m` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, the variable `j` will take values from 0 to `m - 1`. 

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute at all. In this case, `pixels` remains unchanged, and the state of `n`, `i`, and `m` remains the same.
2. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `m` times. For each iteration:
   - If the conditions are satisfied, `pixels[i][j]` may be set to '+'.
   - If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the loop will skip to the next iteration without changing `pixels[i][j]`.
   - If neither condition applies, `pixels[i][j]` will be set to '.'.

At the end of the loop:
- `n` remains between 1 and 2000.
- `i` remains 2.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` will be equal to `m` after the loop finishes (since it increments on each iteration until it reaches `m`).

Given these considerations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `pixels` array has been modified with '+' at specific indices or remains unchanged based on the conditions applied during the loop iterations.**
