The code `continue` does not change any variables or states directly; instead, it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
