The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are assigned to the extremes of floating-point numbers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list of lists containing input strings with length equal to `n`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing coordinates of elements in `pixels` that are equal to 'w', `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list of lists containing input strings with length equal to `n`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing coordinates of elements in `pixels` that are equal to 'w', `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`**.
