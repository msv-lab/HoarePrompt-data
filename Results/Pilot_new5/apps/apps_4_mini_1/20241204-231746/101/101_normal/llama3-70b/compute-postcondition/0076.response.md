Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `j` is equal to `max_y` and `pixels[i][j]` is '+', the value of `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration; if not, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'***
