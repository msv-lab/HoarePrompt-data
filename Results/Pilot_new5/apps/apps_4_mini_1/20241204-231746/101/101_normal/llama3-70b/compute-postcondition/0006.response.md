The code snippet assigns values to `max_x` and `max_y` based on comparing the current maximum values with the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum of their current values and the new coordinates. 

Since `max_x` and `max_y` are not defined in the initial state, we only state that their values are updated. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least one tuple representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(max_y, y)**
