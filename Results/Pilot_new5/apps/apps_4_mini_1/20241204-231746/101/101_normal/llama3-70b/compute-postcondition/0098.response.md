Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, then the conditions related to `pixels` and `white_pixels` hold, and `frame_size` is confirmed to be greater than both `n` and `m`. Otherwise, the `pixels` contain `n` rows where each row is a string formed by the elements of that row in the original `pixels`, and all rows have been printed out.***
