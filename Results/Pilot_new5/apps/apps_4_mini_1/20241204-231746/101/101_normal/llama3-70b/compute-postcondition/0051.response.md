Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0; `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `i` is not equal to `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `j` is not equal to `max_y`. If the value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then the conditions hold as stated. If the value of `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then it is confirmed that `pixels[i][j]` equals '.' instead.***
