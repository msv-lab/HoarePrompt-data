Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` contains at least one 'w', `white_pixels` is a list containing the coordinates of all 'w' in `pixels`, `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w', `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w', `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w', `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w', and `frame_size` is equal to max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1. The current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.***
