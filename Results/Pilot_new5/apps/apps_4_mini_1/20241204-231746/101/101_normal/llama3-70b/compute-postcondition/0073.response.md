Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. It is not the case that either `i` is equal to `min_x`, or `i` is equal to `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `j` is equal to `max_y`, or that `pixels[i][j]` is equal to '.'; and `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w'.***
