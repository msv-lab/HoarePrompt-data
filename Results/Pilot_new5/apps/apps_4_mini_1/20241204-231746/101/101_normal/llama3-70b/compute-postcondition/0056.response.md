The code assigns the character `'.'` to the position `pixels[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so the specific operation will be `pixels[1][1] = '.'`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the operation does not affect these variables directly.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` is assigned the value '.'**
