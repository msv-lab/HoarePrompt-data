According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop continues while `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. 

For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, the value of `m` must still be greater than 1 (to allow `j` to be less than `m`).

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
