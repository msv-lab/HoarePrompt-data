The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the 2D list `pixels` at the position defined by the indices `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is `1` and `j` is `2`, this means that `pixels[1][2]` is now `'.'`. The other variables, `n`, `m`, and `j`, are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[1][2]` is '.'**
