Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0. If `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `i` is neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, and `j` is neither `min_y` nor `max_y`, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the conditions hold as stated. If `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` remains '.' instead.***
