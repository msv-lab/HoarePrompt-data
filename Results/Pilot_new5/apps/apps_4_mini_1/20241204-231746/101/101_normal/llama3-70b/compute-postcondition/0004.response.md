To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the state variables:

- The loop iterates over `white_pixels`, which is a list of tuples representing coordinates of elements in `pixels` that are equal to 'w'.
- For the loop to execute, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple (i.e., it must not be empty).

Given the provided state:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (this is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop).
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (also not directly relevant).
- `pixels` is a list of lists containing input strings with length equal to `n` (we need to ensure this contains 'w' for `white_pixels` to be populated).
- `white_pixels` is currently an empty list, which means the loop will not execute unless it contains at least one coordinate.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to extreme values, which may be updated during the loop but do not impact whether it can start.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple. This can be achieved if `pixels` contains at least one 'w' character.

Therefore, the adjustments required are:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least one tuple representing coordinates of 'w'**.
