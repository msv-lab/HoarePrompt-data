The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the value at the position `pixels[i][j]` to '+'. The initial state provides that `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and the specific value at `pixels[i][j]` before this assignment is equal to '.'. This means that the previous character at that location is changed from '.' to '+'.

No other variables are affected by this operation, so the output state will reflect the updated value at the specified index in `pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**.
