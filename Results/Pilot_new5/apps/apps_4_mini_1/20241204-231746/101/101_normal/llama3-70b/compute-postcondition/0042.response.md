According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is between 1 and 2000, which means the loop can execute for at least one more iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

The state of `m` does not affect the increment of `i`, but it may affect the update of `pixels[i][j]`. However, since `m` is greater than or equal to 0, the next iteration can proceed as long as `i` is still less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` still satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0**
