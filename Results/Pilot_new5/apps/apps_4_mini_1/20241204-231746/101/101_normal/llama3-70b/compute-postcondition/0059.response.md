According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Therefore, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
