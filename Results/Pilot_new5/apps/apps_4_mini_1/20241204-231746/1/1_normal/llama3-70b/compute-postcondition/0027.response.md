Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `f` is True; if `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `ind` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind` remains -1 if `s[i]` is equal to '['.***
