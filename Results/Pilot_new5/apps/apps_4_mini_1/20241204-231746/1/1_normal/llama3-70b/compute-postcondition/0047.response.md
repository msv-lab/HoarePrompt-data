Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; if the condition `f` is true, then `bind` is set to `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is false, the state of `bind` remains unchanged at -1.***
