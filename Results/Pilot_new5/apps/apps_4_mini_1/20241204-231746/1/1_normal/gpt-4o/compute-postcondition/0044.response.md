Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ind + 1`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 1; if `s[i]` is a colon character, `start_colon` is set to `ind + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
