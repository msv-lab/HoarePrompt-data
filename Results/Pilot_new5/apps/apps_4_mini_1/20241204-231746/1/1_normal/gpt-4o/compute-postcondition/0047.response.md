The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ind + 2`; `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`; `ind` is less than `bind - 1;` `start_colon` is `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
