Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; if `s[i]` is '|', then `i` is incremented by 1 and `pipe_count` is increased by 1, with the conditions for `bind`, `ind`, `end_colon`, and `start_colon` remaining valid; `i` must still be less than `end_colon - 1`.***
