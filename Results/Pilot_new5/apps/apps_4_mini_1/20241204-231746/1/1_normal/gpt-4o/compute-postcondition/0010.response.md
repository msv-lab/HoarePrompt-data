The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
