`bind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n - 1`. The previous value of `bind` was -1, but now it is updated to `n - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `bind` is now `n - 1`; the current value of `s[i]` is ']'.
