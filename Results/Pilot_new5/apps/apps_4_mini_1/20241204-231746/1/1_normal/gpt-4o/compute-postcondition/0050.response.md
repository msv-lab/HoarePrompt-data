The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `bind`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind`; `start_colon` is the index of the first colon character found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind`, or -1 if no colon was found in that range; `end_colon` is -1.
