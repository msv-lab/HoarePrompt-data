The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `ind` will also be 0 after this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the current value of `s[i]` is '['; `ind` is 0.**
