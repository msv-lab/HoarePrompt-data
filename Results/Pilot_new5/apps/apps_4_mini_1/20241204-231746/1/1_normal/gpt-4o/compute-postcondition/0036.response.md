To determine the necessary state adjustments for the `for` loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions and variables involved in the loop:

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `ind + 1` and `bind`.
2. For the loop to execute, the starting point of the range (`ind + 1`) must be less than the ending point (`bind`).

Given the provided states:
- `n` is greater than 0 (this does not directly affect the loop execution).
- `i` is not -1 (this indicates that `i` can take valid values).
- `bind` is not -1 (this is necessary for defining the end of the range).
- `ind` is less than `bind` (this is necessary for the range to make sense).
- `start_colon` is -1 (this state does not affect the loop execution).

Next, we need to ensure that `ind + 1 < bind`. Since `ind` is less than `bind`, if we add 1 to `ind`, it might still be less than `bind`, depending on the exact values. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.

The only condition we need to verify is that `ind + 1` indeed results in a value that is still less than `bind`.

Thus, the required adjustments would be:
- Ensure that `ind + 1` is less than `bind`, which means `ind` must be less than `bind - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is not -1; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 1; `start_colon` is -1.**
