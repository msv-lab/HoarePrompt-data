Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 2`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 2`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is a colon (':'), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
