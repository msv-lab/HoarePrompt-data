The variable `p` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input represents a sequence of integers that form a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `b` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones of length n.**
