The value of `b` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the input (which consists of space-separated integers) to integers. The previous values of `b` are replaced by this new list of integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of the integers provided as input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of the integers provided as input.**
