The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with both lists having a length of n. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the given criteria which is not explicitly stated in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list `b` containing zeros and ones, and returns a result that is dependent on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list p which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
