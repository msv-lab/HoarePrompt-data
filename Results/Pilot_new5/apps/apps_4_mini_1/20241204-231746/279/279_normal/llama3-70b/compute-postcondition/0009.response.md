The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was either 0 or 1, depending on the condition of the permutation `p` relative to the index `i`. However, since we know that `ans` is being incremented directly, we conclude that `ans` now holds a positive integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, the current value of `b[i]` is 0, and `ans` is a positive integer (previous value of `ans` + 1)**
