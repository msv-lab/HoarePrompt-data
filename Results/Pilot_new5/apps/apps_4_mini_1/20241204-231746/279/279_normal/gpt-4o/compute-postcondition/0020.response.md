The statement `visited[x] = True` sets the value at index `x` of the list `visited` to `True`. The initial state indicates that the first value of `visited` is `True`, and the value at index `x` must be adjusted to `False`. Therefore, the previous value at index `x` is `False`, and now it will be changed to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` has `True` at index 0 and `True` at index `x`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing 0 and `x`, `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1**.
