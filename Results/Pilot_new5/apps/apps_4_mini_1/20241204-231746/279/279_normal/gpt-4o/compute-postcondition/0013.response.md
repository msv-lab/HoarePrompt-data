The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The previous value of `x` is 0. The list `cycle`, which is initially empty, will now contain one element, which is the value of `x`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` values with the first value `True` and the rest `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing 0, `x` is 0.**
