The code `cycles.append(cycle)` appends the current `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. The `visited` indices remain unchanged as this operation only adds to the list of cycles. The `cycle` itself also remains unchanged, but its reference is added to `cycles`. The state of `x` as an index pointing to an already visited node remains unaffected as well.

Output State: **`visited` contains `True` for every index that was visited during the loop iterations, `cycles` now contains the previous cycles plus the current `cycle`, `cycle` contains all indices that were part of the cycle, `x` is an index that points to an already visited node.**
