Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, and `cycles` is an empty list. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited` will be updated to mark the indices that have been visited, `cycles` will include the previous cycles along with the current `cycle`, which contains all indices that were part of the cycle, and `x` will point to an already visited node. If `visited[i]` is True, no changes occur.***
