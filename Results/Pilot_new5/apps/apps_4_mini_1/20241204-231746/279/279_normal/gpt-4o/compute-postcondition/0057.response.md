`cycle` is updated to include the value of `x`. The value of `x` is already defined as `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[2]` is True, `visited[x]` is True, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current cycle which now includes 2, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, `p[2]` is greater than 2, and `cycle` now includes `x`.**
