Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a valid permutation of length `n`, and a list `b` consisting of integers (0s and 1s). It identifies cycles in the permutation defined by `p` and counts how many of these cycles consist entirely of indices where the corresponding value in `b` is `0`. If there is exactly one cycle, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count of cycles consisting entirely of 0s if the count is greater than `0`; if none of the cycles consist of 0s, it prints `1`. **
