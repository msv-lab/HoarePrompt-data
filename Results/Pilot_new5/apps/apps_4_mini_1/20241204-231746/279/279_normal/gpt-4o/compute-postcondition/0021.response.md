The variable `cycle` is updated by appending the value of `x` to it. Prior to this operation, `cycle` contains the values 0 and `x`. After appending `x`, the new state of `cycle` will include the value of `x` again. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` has `True` at index 0 and `True` at index `x`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing 0, `x`, and `x` (again), `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1.**
