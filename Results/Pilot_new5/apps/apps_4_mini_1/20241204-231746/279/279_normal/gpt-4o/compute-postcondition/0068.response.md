Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values, `cycles` is a list of lists containing all the cycles identified in the permutation described by `p`, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of the counts of cycles where all corresponding values in `b` are 0. If there is exactly one cycle in `cycles`, `0` has been printed. Otherwise, `no_reverse_components` remains unchanged and the output is `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, the output is 1.***
