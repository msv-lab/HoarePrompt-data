Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic implemented is based on calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals k1, k2, and k3. However, the problem requires that at least one garland must be lit during each second after the maximum starting time, which is not guaranteed by simply checking if the GCD of the intervals is 1.

For example, consider the input:

```
2 2 2
```

In this case, the GCD is 2, and the program will output "NO". However, if Mishka switches on all garlands at second 1, they will be lit at seconds 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. This means that there is a way to light the garlands such that during each second after the maximum x (which is 1 in this case), at least one garland would indeed be lit.

Thus, the program fails to account for scenarios where multiple garlands can be switched on in a way that covers every second, despite having a GCD greater than 1. Therefore, the logic is inadequate, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
