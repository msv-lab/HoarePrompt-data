According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is not zero (i.e., when `b` is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `b` is equal to `a % b`. 

Since both `a` and `b` are positive integers, for `b` to be non-zero in order for the loop to proceed one more time, we need to ensure that `a` is not a multiple of `b`. If `b` is equal to `a % b`, it indicates that `b` must be strictly less than `a`. Therefore, the condition must be adjusted so that `b` can still be a positive integer.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer equal to `a % b, and `b` must be less than `a`**
