According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (or true), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `b_prev % b`, where `b_prev` is greater than 0. This means that `b` was modified in the last iteration, and since `b_prev` is greater than 0, `b` must also be greater than or equal to 0. However, the exact value of `b` is not specified, so it could be 0 as a result of the modulus operation if `b` was equal to `b_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be adjusted to be non-zero.

State: **`a` is equal to the current value of `b`; `b` must be greater than 0**
