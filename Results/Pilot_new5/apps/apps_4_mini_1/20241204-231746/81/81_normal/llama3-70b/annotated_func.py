#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of 'a', which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and it computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the GCD. If both `a` and `b` are positive, the function properly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers greater than 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of 'a' and 'b' divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where 'a' and 'b' are positive integers greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value, as dividing by zero would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise an error, but this case is not handled within the function.
