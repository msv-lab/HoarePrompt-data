The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers greater than 0. After executing the function body, it returns the product of `a` and `b`, divided by the result of another function `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the output of `func_1(a, b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by `func_1(a, b)`.**
