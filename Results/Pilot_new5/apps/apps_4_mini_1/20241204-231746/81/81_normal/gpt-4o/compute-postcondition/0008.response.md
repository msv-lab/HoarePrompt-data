The variable `b` is assigned the value of `z // i * x`. Given that `z` is equal to `y // x`, the calculation for `b` becomes `(y // x) // i * x`. Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `y // x * x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and a multiple of `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `z` is at least 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to `y` (since `b` = `y // x * x` which equals `y` when `y` is a multiple of `x`).

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and a multiple of `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `z` is at least 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `y`.**
