The value of `count` is incremented by 2. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1; `a` is equal to `i * x; `b` is equal to `z // i * x; `count` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1; `a` is equal to `i * x; `b` is equal to `z // i * x; `count` is increased by 2.**
