To execute the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \( 1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9 \)
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \( 1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9 \) and `y` is a multiple of `x`
- `i` is an integer representing \( (i + 1) \leq \text{int}(\sqrt{z}) \)
- `a` is equal to \( i \times x \)

Now let's analyze the code:
```
b = z // i * x
```

Here, `b` is assigned the value of \( z // i \times x \). The value of `b` depends on the variable `z` and the integer division of `z` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

We can state the conditions:
- The value of `i` is defined, being less than or equal to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{z}) \), so it is a positive integer.
- The value of `z` is indirectly related through \( i \) and must be a positive integer as well since `i` is positive.

Updated variables:
- `b` is calculated as \( (z // i) \times x \).

Final output state:
- The initial conditions for `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is now defined based on the calculation involving `z` and `i`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is an integer representing (i + 1) less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(z)); `a` is equal to `i * x`; `b` is equal to (z // i) * x.**
