To determine whether the provided program is correct according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and check for potential issues.

### Given Program
```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```

### Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` correctly.
2. **Pair Counting**: It iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` with `l <= a, b <= r`. The outer loop iterates `a` from `l` to `r`, and the inner loop iterates `b` from `a` to `r`. This approach counts each pair `(a, b)` where `a <= b`, but it doesn't account for the distinct pairs `(b, a)`, as it only checks pairs with `a <= b`.
3. **GCD and LCM Check**: 
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(a, b)` computes the LCM using the relationship `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.

### Potential Issue
The program only checks pairs `(a, b)` where `a <= b`, thus it misses counting pairs `(b, a)` for all cases where `a != b`. For instance, if we have valid pairs `(a, b)` such as `(3, 6)` and `(6, 3)`, the program will only count `(3, 6)`. This means the total count of good pairs `(a, b)` will be incorrectly reported as it will not include combinations where `b < a`.

### Example Case
Let's take an example to illustrate the problem:
- Suppose we have `l = 1`, `r = 3`, `x = 1`, `y = 3`.
- The valid pairs should be `(1, 3)` and `(3, 1)`.
- The program counts only `(1, 3)` but misses `(3, 1)`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly count the number of good pairs because it does not consider the pairs where `b < a`.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly handle the counting of distinct pairs `(a, b)` where `a != b`, it is incorrect. The program fails for cases where valid pairs exist in both orders.

Correctness: **False**.
