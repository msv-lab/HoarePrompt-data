To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is supposed to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in the input string such that there are no uppercase letters between the positions of these letters. 

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program extracts the indexes of all lowercase letters in the string `s` and calculates their count. However, it does not consider the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between selected indexes of lowercase letters.

### Example Cases to Illustrate the Issue:
1. Consider the input:
   ```
   5
   aAbBc
   ```
   - The lowercase letters are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
   - Positions of 'a' are [0, 1] (but only one can be chosen), 'b' at position 3, and 'c' at position 4.
   - The maximum pretty set would include positions 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to 'b' and 'c', which gives us a count of 2 (not 3).

2. Consider another input:
   ```
   10
   aBacCdE
   ```
   - The lowercase letters are at positions 0, 2, 4, but we can't choose them all due to the uppercase letters 'B' and 'C' in between.
   - The maximum pretty set here would be {0, 2} or {2, 4} giving us a count of 2.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly count the positions of lowercase letters when uppercase letters are present between them. It simply counts lowercase letters without addressing the condition imposed by uppercase letters. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem requirements for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**
