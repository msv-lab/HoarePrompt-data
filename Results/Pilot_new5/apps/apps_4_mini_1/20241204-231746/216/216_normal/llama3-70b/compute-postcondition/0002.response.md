The variable `lowercase` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a list of indices `i` for each character `c` in the string `s` if the character is a lowercase letter. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200. The characters in `s` could be a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

The impact of the code is that `lowercase` will contain indices of all lowercase characters found in the string `s`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length `n`; `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase letters in `s`.**
