The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The length of this string will be `n`, which is a positive integer within the bounds of 1 to 200. The value of `s` will depend on what the user inputs, but it will consist of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it does not get modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length `n`, where `s` is an input string.**
