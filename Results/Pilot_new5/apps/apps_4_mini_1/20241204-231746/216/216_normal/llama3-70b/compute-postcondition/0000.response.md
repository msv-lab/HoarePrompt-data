The value of `n` is reassigned to the value obtained from `int(input())`, which will be an integer. The string `s` remains unchanged and retains its previous value consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length `n`. The specific value of `n` is now determined by user input, but it must remain within the bounds of 1 to 200 as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input within 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length `n`.**
