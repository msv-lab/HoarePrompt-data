The variable `current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `current_count` was determined based on `char`, but since `current_count` is now explicitly set to `0`, the maximum value of `current_count` has been reset. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character in `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0.**
