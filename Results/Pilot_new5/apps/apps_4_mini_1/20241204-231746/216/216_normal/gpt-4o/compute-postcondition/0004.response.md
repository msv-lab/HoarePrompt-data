`current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set; `current_count` is 0.
