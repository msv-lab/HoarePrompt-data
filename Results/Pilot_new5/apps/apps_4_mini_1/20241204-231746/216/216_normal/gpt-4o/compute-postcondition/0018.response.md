The code increments `current_count` by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character in `s`, `current_set` has `char` added to it if `char` is a lowercase letter, and `current_count` is increased by 1.
