The statement `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` updates the value of `max_count` to be the greater of its previous value or the current count of unique lowercase letters. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `max_count` while retaining the previous state of the other variables.

Output State: **`max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`.**
