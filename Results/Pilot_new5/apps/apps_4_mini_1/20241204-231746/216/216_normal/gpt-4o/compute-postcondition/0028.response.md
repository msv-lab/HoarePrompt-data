The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. Since `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0, it will now reflect either its current value or `current_count`, whichever is greater. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` remains unchanged, `current_count` remains unchanged, and `max_count` is now the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.**
