Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `s`, which is a lowercase letter if `char` was not previously in `current_set`. Otherwise, `current_set` remains unchanged and `current_count` remains the same.***
