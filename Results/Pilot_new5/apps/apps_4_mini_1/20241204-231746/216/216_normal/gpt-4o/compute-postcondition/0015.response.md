Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `char` is the first character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then `current_set` contains `char`, and `current_count` is 1, provided `char` was not previously in `current_set`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` remains empty, and `current_count` remains 0.***
