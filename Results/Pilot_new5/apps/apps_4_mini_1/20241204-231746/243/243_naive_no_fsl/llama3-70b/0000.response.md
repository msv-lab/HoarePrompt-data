Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to accurately compute the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number `n` and thus does not identify the integers `n` whose factorials end with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

Here are a few cases to illustrate the program's incorrectness:

1. **Case when `m = 1`**: The output should be `5` and the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`, as shown in the example. When this input is processed, the program attempts to determine how many integers have exactly one trailing zero in their factorial but does not correctly enumerate the possible integers.

2. **Case when `m = 5`**: The output should be `0` since there are no integers whose factorial ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. However, the program logic fails to precisely determine this due to the incorrect handling of the count of trailing zeroes.

3. **General case for higher values of `m`**: The logic implemented in the loops does not correctly calculate the trailing zeroes because the way to compute the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is by summing `n // 5`, `n // 25`, and so on, which is not addressed in the program.

In summary, the current implementation does not follow the logic required to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes, leading to incorrect results for several inputs.
