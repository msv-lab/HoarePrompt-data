To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition:

The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.

### Analyzing the States:
1. **Current State of `left`:** It is defined as `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2, which means it is an integer value that can be adjusted by changing either `low` or `high`.

2. **Current State of `zeroes`:** It is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. This doesn't directly affect the loop condition but indicates the behavior of the function based on `mid`.

3. **Current State of `m`:** It is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, which means `m` is definitely a valid value.

### Requirements for Loop Execution:
- For the loop to execute at least once, the outcome of `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. If it does not, then adjustments are necessary.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `func_1(left) == m` must hold true for the loop to run, and we currently do not know the specific value of `func_1(left)`, we can make references to potential adjustments:
  - If `func_1(left)` currently returns a value different from `m`, either `left` needs to be adjusted or the function `func_1` needs to be altered to ensure its output matches `m`.

### Conclusion:
Thus, since `left` is defined in terms of `low` and `high`, we need to ensure that some adjustment guarantees that `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 and func_1(left) must equal m**.
