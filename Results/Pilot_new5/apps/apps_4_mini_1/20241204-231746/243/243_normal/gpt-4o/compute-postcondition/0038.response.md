The code `result = []` initializes the variable `result` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, but the state of `result` will certainly be updated.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list**.
