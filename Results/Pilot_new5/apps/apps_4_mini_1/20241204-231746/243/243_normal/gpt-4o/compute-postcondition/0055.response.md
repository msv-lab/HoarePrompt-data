The code assigns a list to the variable `result` that contains a range of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. Given that `left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, the value of `left + 1` will still be affected by the value of `k`. The value of `right` is equal to `mid + (k + 1)`.

The range of integers generated will be from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, which can be expressed as:

- `left + 1 = (original_value_of_left - k) + 1 = original_value_of_left - k + 1`
- `right - 1 = (mid + (k + 1)) - 1 = mid + k`

Thus, the `result` will be a list of integers starting from `original_value_of_left - k + 1` to `mid + k - 1`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged, but since `result` is now assigned a new list, we note that change as well.

Output State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(right)` is greater than `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + (k + 1)`, `result` is a list from `original_value_of_left - k + 1` to `mid + k - 1`**.
