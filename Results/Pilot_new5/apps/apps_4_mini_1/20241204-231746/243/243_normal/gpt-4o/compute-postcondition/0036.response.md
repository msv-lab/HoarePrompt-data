The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be greater than its previous value. The values of `m`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `high` is unchanged; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.**
