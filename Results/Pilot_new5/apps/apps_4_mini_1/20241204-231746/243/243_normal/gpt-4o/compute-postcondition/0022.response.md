To determine if the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute for the first time, the result of `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

Given the current state:
- `left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed.
- `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1).
- `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.
- `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, which is less than or equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `right` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1.

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Since `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`, we don't know how `func_1(right)` compares to `m`, depending on the specific implementation of `func_1`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` is indeed `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust it so that the condition is satisfied.

Since `right` is calculated based on `m`, we do not have enough information yet to determine the specific values needed for that condition. Therefore, to guarantee that the loop executes, we can assume that we need to ensure a situation where `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 

Thus, we can summarize:

State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed, `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.**
