Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is decreased by `k`, `func_1(right)` is greater than `m`, `right` is updated to `mid + (k + 1)`, `result` is a list from `original_value_of_left - k + 1` to `mid + k - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
