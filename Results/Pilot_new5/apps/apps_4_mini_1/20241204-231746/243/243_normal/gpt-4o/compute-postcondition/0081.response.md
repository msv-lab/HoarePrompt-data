The variable `result` is assigned the value of `list(range(left + 1, right))`, which creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. The values of `left` and `right` are derived from the initial state, but their specific values are not provided.

Since `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k` and `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + (n + 1)`, we can denote the expanded range in terms of `low`, `high`, `k`, and `n`.

The `range` function generates numbers from `left + 1` to `right`, where `left` and `right` are defined as stated. Hence, the output state updates `result` to be a list of integers from `((low + high) // 2 - k + 1)` to `((low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) - 1)`.

Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `result`.

Output State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is a list containing integers from `((low + high) // 2 - k + 1)` to `((low + high) // 2 + (n + 1) - 1)`; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + (n + 1).**
