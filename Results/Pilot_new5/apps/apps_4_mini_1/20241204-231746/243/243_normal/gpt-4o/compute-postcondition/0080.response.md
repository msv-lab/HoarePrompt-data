Output State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + (n + 1), where n is the number of times the loop executed, and func_1(right) must equal m.**
