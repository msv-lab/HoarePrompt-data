To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 2`.
- `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100000`.

For the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m` after the current iteration. We don't know how `func_1` behaves with respect to `right`, but we know that `right` is currently set in relation to `low` and `high`.

Since we want the loop to be able to run again, we can conclude that `right` must remain within a range such that `func_1(right)` continues to equal `m`. Given that `right` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 + 2`, if either `low` or `high` changes in the next iteration, it could affect `right`.

To ensure that the condition `func_1(right) == m` holds for the next iteration, we must specify that `right` must be such that `func_1(right)` continues to equal `m`. Since `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, we'll make it clear that `right` must not change in a way that causes `func_1(right)` to differ from `m`.

Therefore, we need to stipulate that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` in the next state as well.

State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + 2; and func_1(right) must remain equal to m.**
