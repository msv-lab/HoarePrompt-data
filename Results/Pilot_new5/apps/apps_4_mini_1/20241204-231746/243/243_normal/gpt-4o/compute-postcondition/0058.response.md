Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and if `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is decreased by `k`, `func_1(right)` is greater than `m`, `right` is updated to `mid + (k + 1)`, resulting in `result` being a list from `original_value_of_left - k + 1` to `mid + k - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
