To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will run. The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.

1. Given that `left` is equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, we need to ensure that calling `func_1(left)` results in a value equal to `m` for the loop to execute.

2. The state of `left` is currently set to a specific value calculated from `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000, we need to understand if `func_1(left)` indeed equals `m`. 

3. The only adjustment needed for the loop to execute is to ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. If it does not, then we can adjust `left` or reevaluate the function's output to meet this condition.

4. If `func_1(left)` currently does not equal `m`, we don't have specific information on how `func_1` behaves. However, we know that `zeroes` is already defined as the result of `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`.

5. For the loop to execute, the condition `func_1(left) = m` must hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `left` is adjusted such that when passed into `func_1`, it produces `m`.

Adjusting the state, we recognize that a specific condition must be met regarding the output of `func_1`. Since we cannot ascertain the behavior of `func_1` without more information, we can say that `left` needs to be adjusted accordingly to meet the loop's requirement.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` must be adjusted so that `func_1(left) == m`**
