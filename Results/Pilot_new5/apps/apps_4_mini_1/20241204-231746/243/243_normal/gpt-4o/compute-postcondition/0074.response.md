According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `func_1(right)` and its comparison to the integer `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(right)` needs to equal `m`. 

Right before the loop, `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. Since `func_1(right)` is currently not specified, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` evaluates to `m`. This means that the function `func_1` needs to be such that when called with the current value of `right`, it returns the value `m`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state related to `right` or the condition that determines what `func_1(right)` would return to ensure it equals `m`. Since we don’t have information about how `func_1` is defined and what effect the current values of `low`, `high`, and `k` have on it, we need to specify that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.

State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + 1; and func_1(right) must equal m**
