The value of `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. Therefore, the new value of `right` becomes (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed; `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1.**
