According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of `count`, `n`, `m`, and `ans`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first iteration.

State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` is an empty list `[]`**
