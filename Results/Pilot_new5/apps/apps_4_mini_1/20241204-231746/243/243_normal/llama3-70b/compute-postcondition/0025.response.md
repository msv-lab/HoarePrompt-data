Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can be executed indefinitely. Therefore, there are no conditions that would prevent it from executing one more time. As such, no modifications to the program state are necessary.

State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 2, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` is [1]**
