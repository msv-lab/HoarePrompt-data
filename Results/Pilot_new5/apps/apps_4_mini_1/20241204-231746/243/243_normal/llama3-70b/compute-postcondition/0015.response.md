The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` is still equal to 1 and does not affect the calculation because `n // 5` does not change the state of `count` directly. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 3; `n` is 1.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 3; `n` is 1.**
