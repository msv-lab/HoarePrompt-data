Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely unless a break condition is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, the program state does not need any adjustment in this case, as the loop can naturally proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 3, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, and `ans` is [1, 2]**
