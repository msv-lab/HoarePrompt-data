The code prints the last two unique numbers from the sorted list `unique_numbers`, which are the second last and last elements. The initial state indicates that `unique_numbers` contains at least two elements and that the counts of the last two unique numbers are equal to `n / 2`. 

Since `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers from `cards`, we can denote the last unique number as `unique_numbers[-1]` and the second last unique number as `unique_numbers[-2]`. Their respective counts in `count` are both equal to `n / 2`.

After executing the code, `unique_numbers` remains unchanged, but we are now aware of the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`, which will be printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `count` is a Counter object containing counts of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers; `unique_numbers[-1]` is the last unique number; `unique_numbers[-2]` is the second last unique number; the output 'YES' has been printed; the values printed are `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`.**
