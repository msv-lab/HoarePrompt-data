The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and a list of integers. The parameter `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. The second parameter is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100, representing the numbers on the cards. After executing the function body, the output will depend on the logic defined within the function. However, since the output conditions are not specified, we cannot determine specific return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` and a list of integers and perform operations based on those inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (between 2 and 100) and a list of n integers (each between 1 and 100) and performs operations based on these inputs.**
