Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; if `c` is 0, then `c` is increased by 1, `a1` is set to the value of `i`, and `a2` is the new value of `i`; otherwise, `c` remains unchanged, `a1` remains unchanged, and `a2` is equal to `i`, while breaking out of the most internal loop or structure.***
