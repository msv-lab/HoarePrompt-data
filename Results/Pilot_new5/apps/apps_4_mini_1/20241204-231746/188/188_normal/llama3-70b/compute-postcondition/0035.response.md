Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that must have at least 1 key. If `c` is equal to 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, and `a2` is -1, while `i` remains the first key in `d` with the current value of `d[i]` equal to `n // 2`. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, `i` is still the first key in `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
