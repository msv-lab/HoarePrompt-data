`a` is updated by appending an integer value obtained from the input, which will be converted to an integer. The initial state of `n` being an even integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `i` being 1 remains unchanged. The updated state of `a` will reflect this new integer that has been appended. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing the input integer with the new integer appended, `i` is 1**
