The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a sequence of `n` integers (where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It counts the occurrences of each integer in the sequence and checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that both occur `n // 2` times. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid or out of the specified range.
