Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is `i`. If `c` is equal to 0, `c` is increased by 1 and `a1` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `a1` is the appropriate value based on `c`, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
