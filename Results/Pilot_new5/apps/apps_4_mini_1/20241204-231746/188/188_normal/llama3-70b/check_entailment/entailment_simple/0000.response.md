Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Petya and Vasya can fairly choose integers such that they can take all cards with those integers and have an equal number of cards each.

Here's a detailed explanation of the flaws in the program:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The program tries to find two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n/2` times. However, it does not account for the fact that the total number of cards must equal `n` and can be distributed in various ways. For example, if there are three cards with one integer and three cards with another integer, the game would not be fair because Vasya cannot choose a distinct integer that has `n/2` cards each.

2. **Failure to Handle All Cases**: The program does not check if there are enough unique integers in `a` or if the distribution of integers allows for a fair split. It only checks if it finds two integers that have exactly `n/2` occurrences without considering whether other integers may also exist with different counts.

3. **Edge Cases Not Covered**: The logic does not handle the scenario when there are multiple integers, none of which can provide a fair split. For instance, if there are four cards with the same number (e.g., `[2, 2, 2, 2]`), the program would incorrectly output `NO` while it should also consider that two distinct integers can lead to fair sharing.

Thus, the logic for determining a fair game is flawed, as it oversimplifies the conditions necessary for a "fair" outcome based solely on the counts of two integers instead of all possible distributions of the cards.
