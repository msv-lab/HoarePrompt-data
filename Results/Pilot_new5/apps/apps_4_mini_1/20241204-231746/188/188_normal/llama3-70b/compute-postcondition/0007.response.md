`a` is a list that now has an input integer appended to it as an integer value is taken from the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The initial value of `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 < n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing the previous integers plus the new input integer; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 < n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing the previous integers plus the new input integer; `i` is 2.**
