The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables are not changed by this operation, and since `a1` and `a2` are both not equal to -1, we maintain that at least two keys in `d` had values equal to `n // 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` with at least two keys having values equal to `n // 2`; `c` is 2; `a1` and `a2` are both not equal to -1; print output is 'YES'.**
