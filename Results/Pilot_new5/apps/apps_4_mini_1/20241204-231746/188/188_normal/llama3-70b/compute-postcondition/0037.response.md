According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the keys in the dictionary `d`. The loop will iterate over each unique integer in `d`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is either 0 or not equal to 0, which affects the values of `a1` and `a2`. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is equal to `i` and `a2` is -1. If `c` is not 0, then `a1` is -1 and `a2` is equal to `i`. Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more keys in `d`.

Since `i` is the first key in `d` with `d[i]` equal to `n // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must move to the next unique integer in `d`. 

Thus, for the loop to continue executing, `i` will be the next key in `d`, and the state of `c`, `a1`, and `a2` will depend on whether `c` was 0 or not during the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is `i`, `c` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `a1` is the appropriate value based on `c`, and `a2` is the appropriate value based on `c`.**
