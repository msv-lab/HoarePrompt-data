According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to 100 inclusive. The variable `t` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 100. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be 100 for the loop to run one last time, since `range(1, 101)` includes 100 as the last value. To execute one more time after the last iteration, `t` would need to be incremented to 101, which is outside the loop's range.

Therefore, since the loop will not execute again when `t` is 101, we need to evaluate the states of `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `current_cost`, but they remain unchanged as per the condition provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; `min_cost` remains unchanged; `best_t` remains unchanged; `current_cost` remains unchanged; `t` is 101**
