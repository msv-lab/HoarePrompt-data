The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (split into integers) to the `int` type. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, which determines the length of list `a`. The list `a` will now contain `n` integers, each representing the lengths of sticks and satisfying the conditions of being between 1 and 100. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 (updated to the value from input); `a` is a list containing `n` integers which are the lengths of sticks and satisfy 1 <= a[i] <= 100 for all valid indices i.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 (updated to the value from input); `a` is a list containing `n` integers which are the lengths of sticks and satisfy 1 <= a[i] <= 100 for all valid indices i.**
