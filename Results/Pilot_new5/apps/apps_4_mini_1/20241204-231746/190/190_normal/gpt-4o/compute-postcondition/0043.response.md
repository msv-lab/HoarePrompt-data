Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `length` is set to the next integer in `a` if it exists, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, and `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `length` is set to the next integer in `a` if it has one, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
