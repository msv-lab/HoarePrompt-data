The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This action means that `min_cost` is now a floating-point number that is greater than any other number. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list containing `n` integers which are the lengths of sticks and satisfy 1 <= a[i] <= 100 for all valid indices i; `min_cost` is float('inf').**
