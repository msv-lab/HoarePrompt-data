To analyze the impact of the code provided:

1. The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the variable `current_cost` by adding to it the result of the expression `t - 1 - length`. 
2. The variable `length` is defined as the third element of the list `a`, which means its value is known based on the current contents of the list.
3. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Since we do not have specific values for `t`, `current_cost`, and `length` (but we know `length` is valid because it is derived from `a`), the output state will reflect the update to `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `length` is the third element of `a`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`.**
