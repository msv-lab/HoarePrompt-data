The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, so after the assignment, `min_cost` will now equal `current_cost`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the conditions applied to each element of `a`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 101, and `length` is the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the conditions applied to each element of `a`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 101, and `length` is the last element of `a`.**
