The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`, which directly changes its previous value. The initial states of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; `min_cost` remains unchanged; `best_t` remains unchanged; `current_cost` is 0; `t` is 101**
