The line of code updates `current_cost` by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to it. The variable `length` is defined as the first element of list `a`, which is an integer, and it is given that the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`. Therefore, `t - 1 - length` will be a positive integer.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `length` remain unchanged, but `current_cost` is updated based on the calculation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `length` is the first element of `a`, `current_cost` increases by the value of `t - 1 - length`, and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1.**
