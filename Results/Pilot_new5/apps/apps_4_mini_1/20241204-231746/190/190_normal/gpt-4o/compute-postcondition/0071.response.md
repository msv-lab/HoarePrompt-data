The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. The `length` is defined as the third element of the list `a`, and since `length` must be 2 or greater, we can ascertain that `length` is at least 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `t` have not changed as a result of this operation. 

Let's break down the impact:
- `current_cost` is updated: `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`, which means the new value of `current_cost` will be the previous value plus the result of `length - (t + 1)`.
- `length` is at least 2, therefore `length - (t + 1)` is at least 2 - (t + 1) = 1 - t, which indicates that if `t` is less than 1, `current_cost` will increase; if `t` is 1, `current_cost` will be unchanged; and if `t` is greater than 1, it will decrease.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the third element of `a` and must be 2 or greater, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.**
