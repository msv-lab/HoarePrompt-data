The code assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Given that `current_cost` is the total adjustment made based on each element of `a` compared to `t`, and it is mentioned that `current_cost` is currently less than `min_cost`, the value of `min_cost` will now be equal to the current value of `current_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total adjustment made based on each element of `a` compared to `t`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` remains unchanged.**
