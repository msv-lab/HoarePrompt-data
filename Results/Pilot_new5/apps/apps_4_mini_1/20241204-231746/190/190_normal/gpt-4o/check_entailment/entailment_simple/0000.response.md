To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. For each stick, we can change its length to another positive integer.
2. The cost of changing a stick from length `a` to `b` is given by `|a - b|`.
3. A stick length `a_i` is called "almost good" for some integer `t` if it satisfies `|a_i - t| â‰¤ 1`.
4. We need to find a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for `t`, while also minimizing the total cost of changing stick lengths.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads two lines of input correctly, where `n` is the number of sticks and `a` is the list of their lengths.
2. **Logic to Compute Costs:** 
    - The program iterates through all possible values of `t` from `1` to `100` (which is the range of stick lengths).
    - For each potential `t`, it initializes `current_cost` to `0`.
        - It then checks each stick length:
            - If the length is less than `t - 1`, it adds the necessary cost to bring it up to `t - 1`.
            - If the length is greater than `t + 1`, it adds the necessary cost to bring it down to `t + 1`.
    - This logic ensures that after processing all stick lengths, they will all be within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`, thereby making them "almost good" for that `t`.
3. **Finding Minimum Cost:** 
    - The program tracks the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` throughout the loop.
4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the best `t` and the minimum cost.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to fulfill the problem description by:
- Iterating through all possible values of `t`.
- Calculating the cost to adjust each stick's length appropriately.
- Ensuring that all sticks are "almost good" for the chosen `t`.

Therefore, the program is indeed correct, as it faithfully follows the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
