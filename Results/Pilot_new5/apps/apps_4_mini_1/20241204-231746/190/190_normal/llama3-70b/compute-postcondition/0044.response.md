Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and a list of `n` integers where each integer is a positive integer (1 <= a_i <= 100). It sorts the list and calculates the minimum cost to move all integers to a specific target value, `min_t`, which is determined to minimize the total cost. The function then prints `min_t`, which is the optimal target value, and `min_cost`, the corresponding minimum cost. The function handles target values both below and above the median of the sorted list, ensuring it explores the range from 1 to 100.**
