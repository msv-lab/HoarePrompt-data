The value of `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The previous state indicates that `min_cost` was at least equal to `cost`, and now it is set to that value directly. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `mid`, `i` is now `mid - 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost` (updated)**.
