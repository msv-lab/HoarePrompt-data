Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, and `t` equals `mid`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, `min_t` is set to `mid + 1`, and `i` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
