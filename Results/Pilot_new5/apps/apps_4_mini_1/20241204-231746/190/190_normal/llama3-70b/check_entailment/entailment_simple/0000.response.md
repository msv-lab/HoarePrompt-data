To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze its functionality step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program begins by reading an integer `n` (the number of sticks) and then reads a list of integers representing the lengths of those sticks. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting Sticks**:
   - The program sorts the list of stick lengths. This is a reasonable step to simplify the subsequent calculations related to the median, which is an effective target for minimizing the sum of absolute differences.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates an initial cost based on the median of the sorted sticks. It correctly computes the cost of changing all stick lengths to this median. This is a good strategy as the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

4. **Exploring Possible Values of `t`**:
   - The program considers values of `t` both below and above the median (from `mid - 1` down to `1` and from `mid + 1` up to `100`). For each potential `t`, it calculates the cost to change all stick lengths to be "almost good" for that `t`, which involves checking both `t` and `t + 1` as valid target lengths.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost encountered and the corresponding `t` value.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints out the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t`.

### Key Points to Check Against the Problem Description:
- The program must ensure that all stick lengths become "almost good" for some integer `t`. The condition `|a_i - t| <= 1` implies that the lengths can only differ by at most 1 from the target `t`.
- The cost calculation correctly accounts for the absolute differences.
- The program must return a positive integer `t`, which the given logic adheres to since `t` is initialized from the median and adjusted within valid ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully identifies a suitable `t` and corresponding minimum cost by evaluating both sides of the median. It manages to cover all potential cases effectively, ensuring that all sticks can be adjusted to be almost good for at least one positive integer `t`.

Therefore, the correctness determination is as follows:

Correctness: **True** 

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given constraints.
