Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks.**
