The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`, which was previously calculated based on the provided formula. The values of `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged and the specific value of `cost` is now represented by `min_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `t` equals `mid`, `i` is 101, `cost` is calculated based on the formula provided, and `min_cost` equals `cost`.**
