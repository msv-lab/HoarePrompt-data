The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 101. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `t` equals `mid`, `i` is 101, `cost` is the sum of minimum of `abs(x - 101)` and `abs(x - 100)` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` equals `cost`, and `min_t` equals 101.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `t` equals `mid`, `i` is 101, `cost` is the sum of minimum of `abs(x - 101)` and `abs(x - 100)` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` equals `cost`, `min_t` is 101.**
