Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the initial number of stones needed to ensure that no operation of taking a stone (`-`) is performed when the pile is empty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
According to the problem, if Vasya needs to take 3 stones, he must start with at least 3 stones. However, the program initializes `stones` to 0 and calculates the result based solely on the number of operations, which leads to an output of `0`. This output is incorrect because it implies that Vasya could have started with 0 stones and still performed all the operations, which contradicts the problem statement.

Another example is:
```
4
-++-
```
In this case, the program would again allow for a negative number of stones before stopping at `0`, which is not permitted according to the problem.

Thus, the program does not handle the scenario where the number of required stones at the beginning is determined by the number of `-` operations. The correct approach would be to calculate the minimum initial stones needed to ensure that no operation results in an attempt to take from an empty pile. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
