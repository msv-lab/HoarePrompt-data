According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `operation` will take the values of each character in `s` one by one. Given that `s` is a string of length `n`, if the loop has executed for the last character (i.e., at the end of the last iteration, `operation` is set to the last character in `s`), the loop can execute one more time if there is another character in `s` for `operation` to take.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and the length of `s` is `n`. Since `s` can consist only of '+' and '-', if the loop has finished processing the last character, `operation` would be equal to the last character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `operation` should have a value that corresponds to the next character in the string `s`. Therefore, if the loop has processed `n` characters in total, `operation` would be equal to the `n`-th character in `s`. Thus, if the loop is to execute again, it means that it should have `operation` set to the next character in `s`, which would not be possible since the loop exhausted all characters in `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` must be the next character in `s`, and since the loop finishes processing all characters, there isn't a next character.**
