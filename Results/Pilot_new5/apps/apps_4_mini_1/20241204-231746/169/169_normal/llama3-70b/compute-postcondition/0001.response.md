The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The length of `s` is `n`, and since `s` consists of symbols "-" and "+", the length of `s` after the input will still be an integer within the range of 1 to 100. The variable `n` will now equal the length of the input string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`.**
