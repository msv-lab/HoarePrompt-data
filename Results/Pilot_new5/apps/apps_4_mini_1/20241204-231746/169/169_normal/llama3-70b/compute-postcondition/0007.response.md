The code `print(plus_count - minus_count)` calculates the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`. Since it is given that the count of '+' is greater than or equal to the count of '-', the result of this subtraction will be a non-negative integer. However, since the code snippet only prints the result without assigning it to a variable, it does not change the values of `s`, `n`, `minus_count`, or `plus_count`. 

Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; the result of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed.**
