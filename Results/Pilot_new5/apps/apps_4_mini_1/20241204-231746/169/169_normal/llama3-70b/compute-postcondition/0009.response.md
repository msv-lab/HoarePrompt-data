The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the symbols "-" and "+". The functionality of the function is to process the string `s` and return a result based on the counts of the symbols. However, without specific output cases provided, we will focus on the input parameters.
