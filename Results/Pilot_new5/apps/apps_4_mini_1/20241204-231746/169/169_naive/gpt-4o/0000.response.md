Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the operations include more "-" than "+" operations, specifically when the initial number of stones is not sufficient to satisfy the "-" operations. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
----- 
```
In this case, the program would start with `stones = 0` and after processing all five "-" operations, it would output `0`. However, according to the problem description, to perform the first "-" operation, there should be at least 5 stones at the beginning. The expected minimal number of stones in this scenario should be `5`, not `0`.

Thus, since there exists an input case where the program fails to produce the correct output as per the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
