Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly flattens a nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively checks each element of the input `nested_list`. If the element is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that element and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to `flat_list`.

This approach effectively handles any level of nesting and various combinations of lists and non-list elements. The function should work for edge cases such as:

1. An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `[]`.
2. A list with no nested lists: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. A deeply nested list: `func_1([1, [2, [3, 4]], 5])` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly and adheres to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
