In this case, `flat_list` is updated by extending it with the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the second element of `nested_list`. The values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` will change based on the execution of this code. 

The specific value of `i` will affect the output of `func_1(i)`, but since we do not have the actual values of `nested_list` or the outcome of `func_1(i)`, we can only express `flat_list` in terms of this function. 

The output state will reflect the updated `flat_list` based on the function's return value and the existing values in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements; `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(i)` where `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.**
