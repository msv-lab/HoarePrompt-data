According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` has at least two elements, the loop has executed at least once. The current state indicates that `i` represents the second element of `nested_list`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to iterate over the next element in `nested_list`, which means we must consider the index of `i`. If `nested_list` has more than two elements, `i` must be updated to the next element in the list.

Since `nested_list` has at least two elements, and the loop is currently on the second element, the next iteration will involve the third element. Therefore, `nested_list` must have at least three elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, i is the third element of `nested_list`, flat_list is updated accordingly**
