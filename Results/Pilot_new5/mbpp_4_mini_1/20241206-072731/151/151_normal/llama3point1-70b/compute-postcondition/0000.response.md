The variable `flat_list` is assigned an empty list. The `nested_list` remains unchanged and retains its original state, which can still include other lists or non-list elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements, and can be nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements, and can be nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
