The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is the third element of `nested_list`, to `flat_list`. The value of `i` depends on the specific contents of `nested_list`, but since `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is guaranteed to be an element of that list.

The initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least three elements and `flat_list` is updated to include this new element. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` has been updated to include `i`.**
