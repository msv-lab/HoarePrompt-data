Postcondition: ***`flat_list` is updated based on the type of `item`. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the third item of `nested_list`. In both cases, `nested_list` has at least 3 items and `item` is the third item of `nested_list`.***
