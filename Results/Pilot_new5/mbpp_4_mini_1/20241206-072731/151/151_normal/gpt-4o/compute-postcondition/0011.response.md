According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again for the third item. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items. To execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and the `item` in the next iteration would be the third item in `nested_list`.

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` has at least 3 items, item is the third item in `nested_list`**
