Output State: **The program returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may contain integers or other lists, or a combination of both, depending on the total number of non-list elements and the elements returned by `func_1` applied to any sublists. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be an empty list.**
