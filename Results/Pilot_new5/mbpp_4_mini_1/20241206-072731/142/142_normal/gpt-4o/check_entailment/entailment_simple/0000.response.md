Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and an `element`, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Iteration through the List**: The function iterates through each item in the list using a for loop.

2. **Comparison**: For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to the provided element. If any item does not match the `element`, the function immediately returns `False`, which is correct as it indicates that not all items are equal to the specified element.

3. **All Items Match**: If the loop completes without finding any non-matching items, the function returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the `element`, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Empty List Case**: If the list is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function correctly returns `True` since there are no items that can contradict the condition (i.e., all items being equal to the element).

Given these points, the function correctly identifies whether all elements in the list are equal to the specified element for every potential case.
