Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(char)` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the provided character. The assertions provided in the program correctly check the ASCII values of 'A', 'R', and 'S', which are 65, 82, and 83 respectively. 

The code handles valid character inputs as expected. Additionally, it implicitly assumes that the input will always be a single character string, as Python's `ord()` function will raise a `TypeError` for invalid input types (like integers, lists, etc.) or a `ValueError` for empty strings. However, since the problem description does not specify handling invalid cases, the implementation is correct under the assumption that valid single character inputs will be provided. Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected based on the provided problem description.
