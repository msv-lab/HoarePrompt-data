Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The goal is to write a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the function `func_1` achieves this by using the built-in `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point for a given character.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input.
2. It uses `ord(char)`, which correctly returns the ASCII (or Unicode) value of that character.
3. The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with different input characters ('A', 'R', and 'S') and compare the output to their expected ASCII values (65, 82, and 83 respectively), confirming that the function works as intended for those test cases.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and accurately retrieves the ASCII value for any single character input, it can be concluded that it is correct.
