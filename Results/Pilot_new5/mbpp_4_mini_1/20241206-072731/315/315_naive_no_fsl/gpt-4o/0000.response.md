Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to add a given tuple to a list. It converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. The assertions provided cover various cases, and all expected outputs match the actual outputs produced by the function.

The logic is sound for any tuple and list combination, including edge cases such as an empty tuple or an empty list:

- Example with an empty tuple:
  - `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())` produces `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
  
- Example with an empty list:
  - `func_1([], (4, 5))` produces `[4, 5]`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and there are no identified input cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, the implementation is correct.
