To analyze the program and determine its correctness, let's break down the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** We need a function that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

**Program code:**
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

**Initial assessment:** 
- The function uses a list comprehension that applies the `sorted()` function to each sublist in `list_of_lists`. 
- The `sorted()` function sorts the strings in ascending order, and if a sublist is empty, it will remain empty.
- If `list_of_lists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is expected behavior.
- The code appears to handle the main requirements of the problem description correctly.

**Edge cases to consider:**
1. **Empty list of lists:** Should return an empty list, which is correctly handled.
2. **Empty sublists:** Should remain empty in the output, which is also correctly handled.
3. **Leading/trailing spaces:** The sorting behavior might be affected by spaces since they are considered characters in string comparison.
4. **Case sensitivity:** The sorting of strings is case-sensitive, which might yield results that differ from expectations if the input mixes uppercase and lowercase letters.

Next, let's assess the **Output hints:**
- The output hints state that the function returns a new list of lists with the strings sorted in ascending order.
- They mention that an empty sublist remains empty and that an empty `list_of_lists` results in an empty output, which aligns with the program's behavior.

Checking the output hints against the code:
- The hints confirm that the code correctly sorts strings and handles empty sublists and lists.

However, the provided examples in the assertions are not extensive enough to cover potential edge cases, particularly related to string sorting, such as:
- Handling strings with leading/trailing whitespaces (since they are part of the string).
- Handling strings with varying cases (e.g., 'apple' vs 'Apple').

**Concrete example for potential failure:**
- If `list_of_lists` includes strings with leading/trailing spaces or mixed-case strings, the sorting may not work as expected. For instance:
  ```python
  assert func_1(([' banana ', 'apple'], [' Apple ', 'banana'])) == [[' apple ', 'banana'], [' Apple ', 'banana']]
  ```
  In the above case, the output would not be sorted in a user-friendly way since spaces and case matter in the sorting.

**Conclusion:**
While the function correctly implements the sorting of sublists, it does not handle cases with leading/trailing spaces or case sensitivity as expected by users who might not consider these nuances. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
