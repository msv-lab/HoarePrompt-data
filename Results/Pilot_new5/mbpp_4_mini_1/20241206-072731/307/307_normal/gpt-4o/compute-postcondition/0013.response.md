The value of `triangular_number` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows:

- `triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`
- `triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 12 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 6`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
