The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 3, so after the execution of the code, `k` becomes 4. The other variables `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 4, and `triangular_number` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 4, `triangular_number` is 6**.
