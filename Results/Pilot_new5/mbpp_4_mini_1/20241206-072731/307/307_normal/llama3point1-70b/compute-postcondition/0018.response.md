The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. The function has multiple return cases based on the value of `n`. 

- In Case_1, if certain conditions are met, the function returns `idx`, which is equal to 1.
- In Case_2, if alternative conditions are met, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 2.
- In Case_3, if yet another set of conditions is satisfied, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return an index value (1, 2, or 3) based on specific conditions related to the number of digits in the triangular number corresponding to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns an index value (1, 2, or 3) based on specific internal conditions related to triangular numbers.**
