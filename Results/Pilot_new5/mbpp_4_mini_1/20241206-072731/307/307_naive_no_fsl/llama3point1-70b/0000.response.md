Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. 

Here's why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
2. **Digit Count Check**: It checks if the number of digits in the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n` by converting the number to a string and using `len()`.
3. **Infinite Loop**: The while loop continues indefinitely until it finds a triangular number that meets the digit requirement, ensuring that it will eventually find the correct index for any valid positive integer `n`.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the index as soon as the condition is met.

The function will work accurately for all positive integer values of `n`, such as 1, 2, 3, etc., returning the correct index for the smallest triangular number with at least that many digits. 

Hence, I cannot think of a case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
