Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly calculates the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It starts from the first triangular number and iteratively checks each subsequent triangular number until it finds one that has the required number of digits. The use of `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` ensures that it correctly identifies the first triangular number with `n` or more digits. The while loop will continue until such a number is found, making it a valid solution to the problem. Since I cannot identify any cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, it is correct.
