Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description, which requires the removal of all whitespace from a string. The implementation of the `func_1` function uses `s.replace(' ', '')`, which only removes spaces (the specific character `' '`) from the input string. However, there are other whitespace characters in Python strings, such as tabs (`\t`), newline characters (`\n`), and others, which are not removed by this method.

For example, if the input string is `"python\tprogram"` or `"python\nprogram"`, the function would not remove the tab or newline, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach should involve removing all kinds of whitespace, which can be done using the `str.replace()` method for all known whitespace characters or preferably using `str.join()` and `str.split()` (or a regular expression) to effectively remove all types of whitespace.

Since the current implementation fails to encompass all whitespace characters as required by the problem description, it is incorrect.
