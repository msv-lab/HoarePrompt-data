Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifies the need to remove all whitespaces from a string, which includes not only spaces but also other whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). 

In the provided code, the `replace(' ', '')` method is used, which only targets space characters and does not account for other types of whitespace. Thus, if the input string contains tabs, newlines, or other whitespace characters, they will remain in the output string. For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the output would be `"HelloWorld\n"`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To correctly implement the function, it should use a method that removes all types of whitespace characters, such as `input_str.replace('\t', '').replace('\n', '').replace(' ', '')` or using a more comprehensive approach like `''.join(input_str.split())` or utilizing regular expressions. Therefore, the current implementation does not satisfy the complete requirements of the problem description.
