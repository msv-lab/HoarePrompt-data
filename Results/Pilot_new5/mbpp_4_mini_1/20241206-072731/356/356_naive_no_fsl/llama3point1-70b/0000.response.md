Correctness: **False**

The program fails to remove all types of whitespace characters, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and multiple spaces. The problem description states to remove "all whitespaces," but the code only removes spaces. For example, if the input is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the expected output should be `"HelloWorld"`, but the function will return `"HelloWorld\n"` due to the newline character being retained.
