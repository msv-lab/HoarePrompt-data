Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area is computed by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters, which are expected to be positive real numbers, as specified in the problem description. 

The assertions provided validate the function with various test cases, and they all pass:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the correct area.
- `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, again correct.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the area for the specified inputs, it meets the requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
