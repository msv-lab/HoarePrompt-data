The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are positive real numbers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. After executing the function body, it returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive real numbers `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle formed by these dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, both positive real numbers, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
