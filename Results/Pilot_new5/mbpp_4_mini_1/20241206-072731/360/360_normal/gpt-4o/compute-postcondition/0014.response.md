`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The value of `sublist` is the second inner list from `list_of_lists`, which contains at least some numbers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, and `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`.**
