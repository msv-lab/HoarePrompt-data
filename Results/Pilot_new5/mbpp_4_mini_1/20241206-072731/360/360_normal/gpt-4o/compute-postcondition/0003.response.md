The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `sum(sublist)`, which calculates the sum of all elements in the `sublist`. The initial state specifies that `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list, while `list_of_lists` must contain at least one inner list, of which `sublist` is the first. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**.
