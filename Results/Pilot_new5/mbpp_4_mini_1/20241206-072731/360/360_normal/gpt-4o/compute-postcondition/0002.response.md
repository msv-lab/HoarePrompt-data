According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one inner list. The variable `sublist` is assigned the first inner list in `list_of_lists` when the loop begins, and `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity, which allows it to be adjusted based on the values in the inner lists during the loop execution. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sum` is still negative infinity.

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`**
