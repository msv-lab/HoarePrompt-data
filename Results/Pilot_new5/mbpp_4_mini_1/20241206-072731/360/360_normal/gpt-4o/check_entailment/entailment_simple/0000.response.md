Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists, `list_of_lists`, where each inner list contains numerical elements.

2. **Finding the Maximum Sum**:
   - The program initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
   - It iterates through each inner list (`sublist`) in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each `sublist`, it calculates the sum of its elements.
   - If the calculated sum (`current_sum`) exceeds `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` with this new value and sets `max_list` to the current `sublist`.

3. **Returning the Result**: After iterating through all inner lists, the function returns `max_list`, which contains the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list, which is a reasonable response since there are no lists to evaluate.
   - The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves correctly for non-empty inputs as well.

Overall, the implementation aligns with the problem description by successfully identifying and returning the inner list that has the highest sum of elements among the given lists. Thus, the program fulfills the requirements as specified.
