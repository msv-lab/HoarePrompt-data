Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which returns the sublist from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

### Explanation:
1. The function iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists.
2. It calculates the sum of each sublist.
3. It keeps track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding sublist.
4. At the end of the iteration, it returns the sublist with the highest sum.

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases and confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the sum of `[10, 11, 12]` (which is 33) is the highest, and the function returns `[10, 11, 12]`.
- For the input `[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]`, the sum of `[12, 11, 10]` (which is 33) is the highest, and the function returns `[12, 11, 10]`.
- For the input `[[2, 3, 1]]`, there is only one sublist, and the function correctly returns it.

The function handles cases where there is only one sublist, as well as cases with multiple sublists, ensuring it correctly identifies the one with the highest sum. 

Additionally, edge cases such as empty sublists or negative numbers would also be covered by the logic of the function, as it calculates sums without assumptions on the values being positive. 

Thus, since the provided function works correctly for all tested cases and potential edge cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
