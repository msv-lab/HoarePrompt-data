#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and n is a positive integer representing the size of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of size `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. The `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, when the length of `merged_list` is odd, the `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`, where `mid` is `n`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, which is computed based on the length of `merged_list` being even or odd, and is dependent on the values of the elements in `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing that size. It merges and sorts these lists, then calculates and returns the median of the combined sorted list. If `list1` and `list2` are empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not handle these edge cases properly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.
