Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description for all possible cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the input lists `list1` and `list2` are of the same size and does not handle edge cases where the lists might be empty or if the integer `n` is less than or equal to zero.

1. **Assumption of Non-Empty Lists**: The function does not check if `list1` and `list2` are empty. If both lists are empty, the merging and sorting process will yield an empty `merged_list`, leading to an attempt to access an index that doesn't exist, resulting in an error.

2. **Handling of `n`**: The function is designed to accept a positive integer `n` which represents the size of both lists. However, it does not validate that `n` corresponds correctly to the actual lengths of `list1` and `list2`. If `n` is provided as a value that does not match the actual size of the lists (for example, if `n` is 0, negative, or inconsistent with the lengths of the lists), it could lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Median Calculation Logic**: The formula used for calculating the median in the comments is incorrect. The program comments state that if the length of `merged_list` is even, the median should be calculated using `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`, but this is not accurate. It should utilize `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2` for the case of even length, which is indeed what is implemented in the code.

In summary, while the provided assertions validate that the function works for specific test cases, the function lacks the necessary input validation to handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Thus, it does not meet the requirements for correctness across all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that the program is not correct.
