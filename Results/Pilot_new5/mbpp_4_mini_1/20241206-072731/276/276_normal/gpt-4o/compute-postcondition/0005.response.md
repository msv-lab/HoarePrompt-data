The value of `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[mid]`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and its length is odd, `mid` would represent the index of the middle element in `merged_list`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains the previous conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers of size `n`, `list2` is a list of integers of size `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and the length of `merged_list` is an odd number; `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.**
