The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the length of `merged_list` by 2. Since `merged_list` contains all elements from `list1` and `list2` and considering `n` is a positive integer, the length of `merged_list` will be `2 * n`. Therefore, `mid` will be `n` after the code execution. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers of size `n`, `list2` is a list of integers of size `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is `n`.**
