You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to (merged_list[size // 2 - 1] + merged_list[size // 2]) / 2. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from the sorted list `merged_list` which contains all elements from `list1` and `list2`, based on whether the `size` is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges and sorts these lists to compute the median value. If the size is even, it averages the two middle numbers; if the size is odd, it returns the middle number. This function assumes that both input lists are of the same specified size, and does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or of different lengths.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
