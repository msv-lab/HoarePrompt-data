To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to consider the requirements stated in the problem description, which is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The code merges `list1` and `list2`, which is correct since we need to combine the two sorted lists to find the median.

2. **Sorting the Merged List**: The merged list is then sorted using `sorted(list1 + list2)`. This operation is not necessary if both input lists are already sorted, as merging two sorted lists can be done more efficiently. However, since the problem does not specify an efficiency requirement, this does not make the program incorrect. 

3. **Calculating the Median**: 
   - The program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`. This is incorrect because the middle index for median calculations should be determined based on the total number of elements, which is `2 * size` (since there are `size` elements in each list). Hence, the correct middle index for even-sized lists should be `size - 1` (for the first middle element) and `size` (for the second middle element).
   - The logic for the median calculation is also flawed. The median should be calculated as:
     - For even-sized merged lists: `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`
     - For odd-sized merged lists: return `merged_list[size // 2]`
   - Since the problem specifies that both lists are of the same size, we can conclude that the combined size is even.

Based on this analysis, we can identify a specific case where the program does not work correctly. For instance:

- If `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program would incorrectly calculate it due to the flawed logic around indexing.

Therefore, the program does not handle the requirements properly.

Correctness: **False**
