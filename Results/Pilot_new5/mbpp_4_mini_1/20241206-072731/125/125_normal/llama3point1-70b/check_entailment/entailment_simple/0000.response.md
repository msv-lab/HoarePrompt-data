Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. The problem requires splitting a list for every nth element, which implies that the function should return segments of the list that consist of every nth element starting from the beginning of the list.

However, the program uses a list comprehension to create sublists, where it generates one sublist starting from each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1` and then takes every nth element from that index. This approach results in multiple overlapping sublists rather than the distinct segments that the problem description implies.

For example, given `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, splitting the original list into two separate lists based on every 2nd element. However, the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` for `i = 0` and `[[2, 4, 6]]` for `i = 1`, which is not what the problem description asks for.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
