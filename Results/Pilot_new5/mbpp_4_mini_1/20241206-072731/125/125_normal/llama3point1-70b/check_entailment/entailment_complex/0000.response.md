Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the current implementation does not correctly return the intended sublists.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. The program uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n` and collects elements starting from each index `i` with a step of `n`. This means:
   - For `i = 0`, it collects all elements starting from index 0.
   - For `i = 1`, it collects all elements starting from index 1.
   - This continues for each index up to `n-1`.

2. The expected behavior based on the problem description is to create sublists that start from each of the first `n` indices and only include every `n`th element from there. In other words, we should be collecting elements that are spaced `n` positions apart from the list starting at every index from `0` to `n-1`.

### Example of Misbehavior:
If we take `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output would be:
- For index 0: `[1, 3, 5]` (elements at indices 0, 2, 4)
- For index 1: `[2, 4, 6]` (elements at indices 1, 3, 5)

The correct output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`.

However, the provided implementation will produce: 
- For `i = 0`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- For `i = 1`: `[2, 4, 6]`
Thus, returning `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 4, 6]]`, which does not match the problem description.

Therefore, the function does not behave as required, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is **False**.
