To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description:
The function must take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Behavior of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `result` as a list of `n` empty sublists: `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`.
2. **Distribution**: It iterates through the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, where `i` is the index and `element` is the element from the list. For each element, it appends it to one of the `n` sublists based on the index `i`: `result[i % n].append(element)`.
   - This approach distributes elements in a round-robin fashion across `n` sublists.

### Expected Output:
The expected output for the function is a list of `n` sublists, each containing elements from the original list, divided by their indices modulo `n`.

### Analysis of Provided Assertions:
The assertions check for specific inputs and their expected outputs:
- The assertion checks for various cases including strings and integers, confirming that the function correctly groups elements every `n` positions.
  
### Conclusion on Correctness:
1. The function does indeed meet the requirement of taking in a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list into sublists for every nth element.
2. It operates as described, creating `n` sublists where elements are distributed properly based on the index of the original list.

### Verification of Edge Cases:
- The problem description states that `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `lst`, which is asserted in the comment, ensuring that the function will not encounter an index error.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the function behaves as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
