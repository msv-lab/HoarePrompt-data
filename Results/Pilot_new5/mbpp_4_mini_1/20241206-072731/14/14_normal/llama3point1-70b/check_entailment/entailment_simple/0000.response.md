Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(arr)` takes a list of integers as its parameter, which aligns with the description of the input type.

2. **Set Conversion**: The expression `set(arr)` converts the list `arr` into a set. A set inherently contains only unique elements, meaning that any duplicates in the original list will be removed in the set.

3. **Length Comparison**: The function compares the length of the original list `arr` with the length of the set. If there are duplicates in `arr`, the set will have a shorter length than the original list, and thus `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` will evaluate to `True`. Conversely, if all elements in `arr` are unique, the lengths will be equal, and the comparison will evaluate to `False`.

4. **Return Value**: The return value is the result of the comparison, which effectively means the function returns `True` when there are duplicates and `False` when all integers are unique, matching the required behavior as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the function fulfills its purpose as stated, thus validating its correctness.
