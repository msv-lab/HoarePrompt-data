The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False` if all integers in `arr` are unique. The function does not handle cases where `arr` might be empty, as this would result in `False`, indicating no duplicates, which is still a valid output.
