The annotated program contains a function `func_1` that is designed to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. Let's analyze the function and its correctness according to the provided problem description.

### Function Analysis

1. **Inputs**: The function takes a list of integers `arr`.
2. **Logic**:
   - It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of unique integers that have been encountered.
   - It iterates through each integer `num` in the input list `arr`.
   - For each number, it checks if it is already in the `seen` set:
     - If it is present, the function returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate was found.
     - If it is not present, it adds the number to the `seen` set.
3. **Completion**: If the loop completes without returning `True`, it means no duplicates were found, and the function returns `False`.

### Assertions

The program includes assertions to verify its correctness with various input cases:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output is `False` (no duplicates), and the function correctly returns `False`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the expected output is `True` (duplicate `4`), and the function correctly returns `True`.
- For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, the expected output is `True` (duplicates `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`), and the function correctly returns `True`.

### Conclusion

The function behaves correctly according to the problem description:
- It accurately identifies the presence of duplicate elements in a list of integers.
- The logic used (checking for existence in a set) is efficient and appropriate for this task.

Since the function meets all requirements specified in the problem description and passes all assertions, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
