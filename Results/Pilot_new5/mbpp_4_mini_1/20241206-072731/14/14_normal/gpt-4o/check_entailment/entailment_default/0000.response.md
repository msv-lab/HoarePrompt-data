The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to check for duplicate integers in a given list. 

Initial Assessment:
- The function uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers encountered as it iterates through the input list `arr`. 
- For each number, it checks if the number is already in the `seen` set. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the presence of a duplicate.
- If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

Edge Cases:
- The function appears to handle most typical cases, including lists with no elements (which would return `False`), lists with unique elements, and lists with duplicates.
- However, it doesn't specifically address the case of an empty array, which would also correctly return `False`. 

Now, examining the output hints:
- The hints assert that the function accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if there are any duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`.
  
The output hints align with the code, as they both confirm that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and its alignment with the problem description and output hints, there are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies duplicates and returns the expected results for various cases, including the provided assertions.
