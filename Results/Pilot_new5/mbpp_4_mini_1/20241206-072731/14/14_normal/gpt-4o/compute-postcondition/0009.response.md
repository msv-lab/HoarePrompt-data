The `seen` set is updated to include `num`. The value of `num` is already confirmed to be the second integer in the `arr` list, and it is also initially in the `seen` set. After the execution of the code, `num` is added to `seen` again (although itâ€™s already present), so the state of `seen` remains unchanged in terms of unique values, but the operation has been executed.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `seen` is a set containing `num` (after adding `num`, it may still contain the same value since it was already there).**
