The `seen` set is updated to include `num`. Since `num` is already in `seen`, it now remains in that set. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `seen` now contains `num` along with its previous elements.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `seen` contains `num` and possibly other integers.**
