Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether the specified list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` with its sorted version using the built-in `sorted()` function. If the two are equal, it means that the list is already sorted; otherwise, it is not.

The logic implemented in the function satisfies the problem description as it accurately checks for the sorted order of the list. The program will correctly return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` if it is not, thus fulfilling the requirement to determine if the list is sorted.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring its correctness.
