Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(nums)` checks whether the list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function in Python. 

Here are the reasons why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function returns `True` if `nums` is equal to `sorted(nums)`, which means that the elements in `nums` are in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This directly addresses the problem requirement to check if a list is sorted.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The explanation provided in the comments states that the function does not explicitly check for edge cases like empty lists or lists with one element, but it correctly identifies that:
   - An empty list is considered sorted by definition.
   - A list with a single element is also sorted, as there are no other elements to compare against.

3. **Boolean Return**: The program correctly returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), which is what the problem description implicitly expects.

Overall, the function behaves as intended for all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with a single element, thus satisfying the requirements of the problem description.
