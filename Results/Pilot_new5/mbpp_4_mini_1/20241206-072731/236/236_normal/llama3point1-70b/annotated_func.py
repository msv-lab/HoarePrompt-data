#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is equal to its sorted version, meaning it checks if 'nums' is in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and returns `True` if `nums` is in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. It does not account for edge cases such as empty lists, which are inherently in non-decreasing order, and the behavior remains the same for lists with one element. Therefore, the function correctly identifies ordered lists and returns appropriate boolean values for various cases, including empty and single-element lists.
