#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be of any type that supports comparison.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last element checked before the end of the loop, and the function returns True. If `lst` has 0 or 1 elements, the function returns True and `i` is undefined.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is either empty, has one element, or has been verified to be in non-decreasing order. The index 'i' is undefined in these cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns True if the list is empty, contains a single element, or is sorted in non-decreasing order. If any adjacent elements are found where the first is greater than the second, it returns False.
