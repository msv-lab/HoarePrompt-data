The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be of any type that supports comparison. The function evaluates the elements of the list according to specific conditions. 

- In Case_1, if the first element of the list is greater than the second, the function returns `False`.
- In Case_2, the function returns `False` based on another unspecified condition.
- In Case_3, the function again returns `False` for another condition.
- In Case_4, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list `lst` is either empty, contains one element, or has been verified to be in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `True` if the list is empty, has one element, or is in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and returns True if lst is either empty, has one element, or is in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False.**
