According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(lst) - 2`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst)` must be greater than `1`. Thus, the list must contain at least 2 elements. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `0`. 

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
