To analyze the output state of the loop after all iterations, we consider the purpose of the loop which is to check if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Given the structure of the loop:

1. The loop iterates through indices of the list up to the second to last element.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if the element at `lst[i]` is greater than the following element `lst[i + 1]`.
3. If any such condition is true, the function will return `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

Now, let's summarize the output states after all iterations:

- If the loop does not execute (which occurs when `lst` has 0 or 1 elements), `lst` is a list with either 0 or 1 element, and both `i` will not have a value because the loop did not run.

- If the loop executes completely without finding any unsorted elements, this means that all elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order, and the function will reach the end without returning `False`.

Combining these observations, we can formulate the final output state:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last element checked before the end of the loop, and the function returns True. If `lst` has 0 or 1 elements, the function returns True and `i` is undefined.**
