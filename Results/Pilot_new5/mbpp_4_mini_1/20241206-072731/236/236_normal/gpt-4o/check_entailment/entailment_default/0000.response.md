The problem description states that we need to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The program provided does this by iterating through the list and checking if any adjacent elements violate the sorted order.

### Initial Assessment of the Code:
The function `func_1` checks for sorted order in a list. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any element that is greater than the subsequent element. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`. This implementation correctly handles the case of an empty list (returns `True`) and also handles lists with a single element (returns `True`).

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list should return `True`, which the code handles correctly.
- A list with a single element should also return `True`, which is also handled by the code.
- A sorted list (non-decreasing order) should return `True`, which is verified by the code.
- A list that is not sorted should return `False`, which is also covered in the code.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function returns `True` if the list is empty, contains a single element, or is sorted in non-decreasing order. It also correctly states that if any adjacent elements are found where the first is greater than the second, it returns `False`. 

This aligns perfectly with the logic implemented in the code. 

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the code correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement and output hints, without missing any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
