According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, which means that the loop has completed its only iteration (as the range `j in range(i)` is from 0 to i-1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to at least 2. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, the current value of `i` (which is 1) must be incremented to allow the loop to run again. If `i` is incremented to 2, then the loop can run once for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
