According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the range of `i`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` will start from 0 and go up to `i - 1` in the next iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` must be at least 1 so that the range of `j` is valid. Given that `i` is now `i + 1`, the loop can execute again for the new value of `i` as long as `i` is still valid.

Therefore, the updated state must reflect that `i` is now `i + 1`, and `j` will take values from 0 to `i - 1`, which means the loop may iterate over `i` values.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's that may have changed at index `i`, and `i` is now incremented to `i + 1`.**
