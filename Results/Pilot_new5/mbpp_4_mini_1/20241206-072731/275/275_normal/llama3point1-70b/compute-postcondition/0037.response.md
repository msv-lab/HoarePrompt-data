According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken a value less than `i`. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `i - 1` at the end of the last iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to run again, `j` should be incremented to `i`, and `i` must remain the same.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, j is i, and i remains unchanged.**
