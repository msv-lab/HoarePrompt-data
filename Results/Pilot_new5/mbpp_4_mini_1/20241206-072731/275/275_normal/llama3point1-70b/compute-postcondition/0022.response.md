According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be able to take the value `i-1`, meaning `i` must be greater than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `dp` is a list of 1's. The variable `j` is currently at its maximum value of `i-1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must increase by 1.

Thus, if `i` is currently at least 1 (since `nums` has at least 2 elements), it can be incremented to `i + 1`, and the loop can run for `j` from 0 to `i`, which means `j` will take the values from 0 to `i-1` in the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's, `i` is at least 2, `j` must be less than `i`, and can be 0 to `i`, with `i` incremented to `i + 1`.**
