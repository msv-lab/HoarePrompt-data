The variable `dp` is assigned a list that contains the value `1` repeated for the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, the length of `nums` is a positive integer, and thus, `dp` will be a list with a length equal to that of `nums`, filled with `1`s.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's.**
