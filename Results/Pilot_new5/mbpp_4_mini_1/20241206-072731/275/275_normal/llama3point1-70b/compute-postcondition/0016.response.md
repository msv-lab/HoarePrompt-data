Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list representing the maximum length of divisible subsequences, initialized with 1's and updated based on divisibility conditions; if `nums[i]` is divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j < i`, then `dp[i]` will reflect the maximum count of such subsequences formed up to index `i`.**
