According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is currently at some value within the range of the list. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and the loop runs until `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

If `i` is currently at the last index (which is `len(nums) - 1`), after incrementing `i` for the next iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(nums)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `len(nums) - 1`, with `len(nums)` remaining the same. 

The state should reflect that the next value of `i` will be `len(nums)`, and the `dp` list will have been updated based on the previous conditions. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list representing the maximum length of divisible subsequences, initialized with 1's and updated based on divisibility conditions; i is equal to `len(nums)`, and dp remains the same.**
