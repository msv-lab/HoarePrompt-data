The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it calculates and returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subset within the sorted list of integers. The function does not handle cases where the provided list could contain non-integer types, which may lead to errors during execution. Additionally, if all elements in `nums` are the same, the function will return the length of the list since all elements are divisible by each other.
