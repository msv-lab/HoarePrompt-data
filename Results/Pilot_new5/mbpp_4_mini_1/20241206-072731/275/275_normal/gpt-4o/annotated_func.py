#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is empty
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the longest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]` for all `i` in the range of indices of `nums`. If `nums` is empty, then `dp` is also an empty list.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list `nums`. If `nums` is empty, then `dp` is also empty, and the maximum value will be undefined in such a case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it calculates and returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subset within the sorted list of integers. The function does not handle cases where the provided list could contain non-integer types, which may lead to errors during execution. Additionally, if all elements in `nums` are the same, the function will return the length of the list since all elements are divisible by each other.
