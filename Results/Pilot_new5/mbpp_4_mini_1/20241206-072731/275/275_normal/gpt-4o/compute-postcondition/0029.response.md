According to the code, the for loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums`. Currently, `i` is the index of the last element processed, which means that the loop has executed for all elements up to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of `nums`.

Given that `nums` is a sorted list with at least one element, the length of `nums` is at least 1, and since `i` was the index of the last processed element, it must be less than `len(nums)` for the loop to continue.

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `i` can be adjusted to `i` + 1, and `dp` must reflect the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for all elements up to this new index `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`**
