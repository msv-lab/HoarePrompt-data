The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]`. It compares the current value of `dp[i]` with the value of `dp[j] + 1`, and assigns the greater of the two to `dp[i]`. The initial state indicates that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`. Since `i` must be at least 3, it implies that `dp[i]` is at least the length of the longest divisible subset including the element at index `i`.

After executing the code, the variable `dp[i]` will either remain the same or be increased by 1, depending on the value of `dp[j]`. The values of `nums` and `dp` before the execution remain unchanged, except for the potential update in `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)**.
