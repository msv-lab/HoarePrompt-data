Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the longest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]` for all `i` in the range of indices of `nums`. If `nums` is empty, then `dp` is also an empty list.**
