According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0, as `range(i)` will generate an empty range when `i` is 0. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `i` must be greater than 0. As it stands, `i` is currently 0, which means the loop will not run. 

For the loop to be executed, `i` must be adjusted to be at least 1, and the initial state of `j` should be set to the first value in the range, which would be 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
