The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[j] + 1` provides a potential new value for `dp[i]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` remains valid, and the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)**
