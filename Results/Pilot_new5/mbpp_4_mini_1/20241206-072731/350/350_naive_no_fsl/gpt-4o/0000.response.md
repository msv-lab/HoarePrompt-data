Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. 

1. It iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index down to the first.
2. If it finds the element `x`, it immediately returns the current index, which is the last occurrence of `x` in the array.
3. If the loop completes without finding `x`, it returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in the array.

The provided assertions test the function with various scenarios, and they all pass:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]` and `1`, it correctly returns `0`.
- For the input `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `1`, it correctly returns `2`, which is the index of the last `1`.
- For the input `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and `3`, it correctly returns `3`, which is the index of the last `3`.

There are no missing edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
