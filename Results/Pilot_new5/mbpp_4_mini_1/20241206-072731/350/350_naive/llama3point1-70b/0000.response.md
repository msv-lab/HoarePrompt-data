Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the list in reverse order and returns the index of the target if found. If the target element is not in the array, it correctly returns -1. This handles all edge cases, including arrays with multiple instances of the target, arrays where the target is at the beginning or end, and empty arrays.
