According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `arr` is greater than 0. This means that `arr` must contain at least one integer. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which will point to the last element of the array. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed properly, the following conditions must be met:
1. `arr` must have at least 1 element.
2. `i` must be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which will be the index of the last element in the array.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
