Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. If the second to last element of `arr` equals `x`, the function returns the index `i` (length of `arr` - 2). Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
