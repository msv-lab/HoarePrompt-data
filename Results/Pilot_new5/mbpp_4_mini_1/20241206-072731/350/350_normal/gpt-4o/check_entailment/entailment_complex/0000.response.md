Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `x`. It iterates through the list in reverse order, checking each element to find the last occurrence of `x`.

2. **Return Values**: 
    - If `x` is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence. This is confirmed by the for loop which starts from the end of the list and moves backward until it finds `x`.
    - If `x` is not present in the array, the function will complete the loop without finding `x` and will return `-1`, indicating that the search was unsuccessful.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code handles various scenarios:
    - If `x` is the first element or appears multiple times, it correctly identifies the last index of `x`.
    - If `x` is not in the list at all, it correctly returns `-1`.

The assertions in the annotated program further validate the correctness of the function by testing it against known cases, confirming that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, the implementation follows the problem description accurately and correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array.
