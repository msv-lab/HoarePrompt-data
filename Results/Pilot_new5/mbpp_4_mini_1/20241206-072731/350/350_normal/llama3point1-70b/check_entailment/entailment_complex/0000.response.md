Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element (target) in a sorted array (arr).

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Iteration from the End**: The program iterates through the array from the last index to the first index. This is crucial for finding the last occurrence of the target.

2. **Comparison**: It checks if the current element is equal to the target. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index of that element.

3. **Return Value**: If the target is found, it returns the index (which is correct, as it reflects the last occurrence). If the target is not found after checking all elements, it returns -1, which is the expected behavior when the target is absent in the array.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and -1 is returned, correctly indicating that the target is not found.
   - The function does not raise any exceptions for invalid comparisons, which is acceptable given that the problem description does not specify requirements for error handling.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description by accurately finding the last position of the target element in a sorted array or indicating its absence by returning -1. Thus, the program is correct and fulfills its intended purpose.
