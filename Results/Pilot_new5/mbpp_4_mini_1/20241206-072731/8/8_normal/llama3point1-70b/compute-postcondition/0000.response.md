`first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be assigned -1. Other variables remain unaffected. The output state thus reflects the new value of `first_occurrence` based on the search result.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.**
