The variable `last_occurrence` is assigned the value of the last occurrence index of `char` in the string `s` using the method `s.rfind(char)`. This means that `last_occurrence` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.**
