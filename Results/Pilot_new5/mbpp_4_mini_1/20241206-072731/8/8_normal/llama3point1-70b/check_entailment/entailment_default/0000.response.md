To assess the correctness of the provided code, we first analyze the problem description and the program implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Function Logic:
1. It finds the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
2. It finds the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
3. If both occurrences are found (i.e., `char` appears in the string):
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same, it means `char` appears only once, and it removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it constructs a new string that skips the first occurrence and the last occurrence of `char`.
4. If `char` is not found in the string (`first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1), it returns the original string `s`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
The program does not handle cases where there are more than two occurrences of `char` correctly. For example, consider the string `"abcabc"` and the character `'a'`. The first occurrence of `'a'` is at index 0, and the last occurrence is at index 3. The function correctly removes both occurrences of `'a'`, resulting in `"bcabc"`. However, if there are three or more occurrences of `char`, the code will only remove the first and last, which may not align with the expectation of removing all instances between them.

### Output Hints:
The output hints specify that the function:
- Removes one occurrence of `char` if it appears exactly once in `s`.
- Removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` if it appears more than once.
- Returns the original string if `char` is not found.

The hints indicate a limitation, stating that the function does not handle cases where the string contains more than two occurrences of `char`, which corroborates with our earlier analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to handle scenarios where `char` appears multiple times and does not remove all intermediate occurrences. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not work correctly for cases where `char` appears more than twice, as it only removes the first and last occurrences without addressing any additional occurrences in between.
