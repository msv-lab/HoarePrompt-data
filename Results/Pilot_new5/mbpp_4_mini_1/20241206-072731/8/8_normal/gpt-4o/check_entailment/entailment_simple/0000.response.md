To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a string.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function Signature**: 
   - The function `func_1(s, ch)` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `ch` (a single character string).

2. **Finding Indices**: 
   - The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.

3. **Handling Absence or Single Occurrence**:
   - If `ch` is not found in `s` (`first_index == -1`) or if there is only one occurrence of `ch` (`first_index == last_index`), the function returns `s` unchanged. This is correct behavior because the problem description states that we should remove the first and last occurrences only if they exist.

4. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**:
   - If there are at least two occurrences of `ch` in `s`, the function constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The substring before the first occurrence (`s[:first_index]`)
     - The substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding both, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`)
     - The substring after the last occurrence (`s[last_index + 1:]`)
   - This logic correctly removes both the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

### Test Cases Provided:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` which is correct.
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'` which is correct.
- `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'` which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly handles cases where `ch` does not exist or appears only once by returning the original string, and it properly removes the first and last occurrences when there are multiple occurrences.

Correctness: **True**
