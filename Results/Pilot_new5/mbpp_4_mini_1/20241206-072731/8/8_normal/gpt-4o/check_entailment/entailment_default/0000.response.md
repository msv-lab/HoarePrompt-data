To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's start by considering the problem description and the program's functionality.

**Problem description:** The function is meant to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

1. **Finding Indices**: The program uses `find` to get the first occurrence and `rfind` to get the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
2. **Conditions**: If `ch` is not found (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is -1) or if it occurs only once (i.e., `first_index` equals `last_index`), the original string `s` is returned.
3. **Removing Characters**: If `ch` occurs more than once, it constructs a new string by removing the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

**Output Hints**: The output hints mention that the function does not handle the case where `ch` is an empty string, which would raise a ValueError.

Now, let's evaluate the edge cases:

1. **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string and `ch` is not empty, the program will return an empty string as expected.
2. **Empty Character**: If `ch` is an empty string, it will raise an error (as mentioned in the output hints), which means it does not handle this case properly.
3. **Character Not Present**: If `ch` is not in `s`, the program correctly returns `s`.
4. **Character Occurs Once**: If `ch` occurs only once, the program will also return `s`, which is correct.
5. **Character Occurs Multiple Times**: This case is handled correctly, as the program removes the first and last occurrences.
6. **Case Sensitivity**: The function treats case sensitivity (e.g., 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters).

Given the above analysis, the function does not handle the case of an empty character string `ch`, which is a valid edge case that leads to an error. Therefore, the implementation does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The case where `ch` is an empty string leads to an error, indicating that the function does not handle all specified cases correctly.
