The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or occurs only once in `s`. If `ch` occurs more than once, it returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. The function does not handle the case where `ch` is an empty string; in such a case, it would raise a ValueError due to the nature of the find and rfind methods.
