To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string under all potential cases. 

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. The program finds the first and last occurrence of the given character using `s.find(ch)` and `s.rfind(ch)`.
2. If the character is not found (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is -1), or if both occurrences are the same (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), it returns the original string.
3. Otherwise, it constructs a new string by excluding the character at the first index and the character at the last index.

Now let's consider some edge cases:

- **Case when the string is empty**: `func_1('', 'a')` should return an empty string, which it does.
- **Case when the character to remove is not in the string**: `func_1('hello', 'x')` should return 'hello', which it does.
- **Case where the character appears only once**: `func_1('hello', 'h')` should return 'ello', which it does.
- **Case where the first and last characters are the same**: `func_1('aaaaa', 'a')` should return 'aaa', which it does.

However, there is a potential case that the function does not handle correctly:

- **Case where the character appears at both ends**: For the string `func_1('abca', 'a')`, the expected result after removing both first and last occurrences of 'a' should be `'bc'`. Let's verify:
  - `first_index` = 0 (index of the first 'a')
  - `last_index` = 3 (index of the last 'a')
  - The string returned is `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` => `'' + 'bc' + ''` which gives `'bc'`.

This case works as expected.

Now testing the case when there are multiple characters, but the first and last occurrences are the same (such as `func_1('abcdabc', 'a')`). The expected result is `bcdab`, and the function will give us `bcdab`, which is correct.

After carefully examining the function and testing various edge cases, including the ones mentioned, the function appears to work correctly for all tested scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
