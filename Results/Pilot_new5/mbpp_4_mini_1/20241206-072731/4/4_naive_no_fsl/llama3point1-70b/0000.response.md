To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function against the problem description, let's break down what the function is supposed to achieve and whether it meets the requirements for all potential cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` uses the XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers:
1. `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. 
2. The result of the XOR will have bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
3. The function then uses `bin(...).count('1')` to count how many bits are set to `1` in the resulting binary representation.
4. If there is exactly one bit set to `1`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Test Cases:
1. **Different at one bit position**:
   - `func_1(2, 3)` → `2` is `10` in binary, `3` is `11`. The XOR is `01`, which has one `1`. Should return `True`.
   
2. **Different at multiple bit positions**:
   - `func_1(2, 5)` → `2` is `10`, `5` is `101`. The XOR is `111`, which has three `1`s. Should return `False`.

3. **Same number**:
   - `func_1(4, 4)` → The XOR is `0` (which has no `1`s). Should return `False`.

4. **Zero and a number**:
   - `func_1(0, 1)` → `0` is `0`, `1` is `1`. The XOR is `1`, which has one `1`. Should return `True`.
   - `func_1(0, 2)` → The XOR is `2`, which has one `1`. Should return `True`.

5. **Negative and positive**:
   - For any negative number and a positive number, the result can be more complicated due to how negative numbers are represented in binary (two's complement). Testing with a negative number and a positive number like `func_1(-1, 0)` results in `1`, which gives `True` (they differ in all bits).

### Conclusion:
The function appears to operate correctly based on the analysis of bitwise operations. 

I cannot find an example where the function does not work as expected. It handles all tested cases accurately according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
