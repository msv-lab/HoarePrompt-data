The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. The function computes a value (`xor_result`) based on these integers and checks if this result is not equal to 0 and is a power of two. If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return `True` if the result of the XOR operation between them is a power of two and not zero; otherwise, it returns `False`.
