Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the requirement of the problem description. The task is to check whether two numbers differ in exactly one bit position. The program accomplishes this by utilizing the bitwise XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`), which results in a number that has bits set to 1 for every position where the two numbers differ.

The function then converts this result into its binary representation using `bin()`, and counts the number of 1s with `.count('1')`. If the count equals 1, it means that the two numbers differ in exactly one bit position, and the function returns `True`. If the count is not equal to 1, it returns `False`.

This logic is sound and covers all potential cases because:
- If the two numbers are identical, the XOR will yield 0 (which has no bits set), and the function will correctly return `False`.
- If they differ in more than one bit position, the result of the XOR will have more than one bit set to 1, and the function will also return `False`.
- If they differ in exactly one bit position, the XOR will yield a number with exactly one bit set to 1, leading to a return value of `True`.

Thus, the implementation adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description.
