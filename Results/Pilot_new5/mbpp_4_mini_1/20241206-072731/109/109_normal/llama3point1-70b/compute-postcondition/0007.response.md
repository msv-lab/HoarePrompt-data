Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. If `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the entire `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the function does not modify it (as list1 being assigned list2 does not change the original list1) and returns an empty list. The function returns a modified `list1` if it was not empty, or an empty list if `list1` was empty.**
