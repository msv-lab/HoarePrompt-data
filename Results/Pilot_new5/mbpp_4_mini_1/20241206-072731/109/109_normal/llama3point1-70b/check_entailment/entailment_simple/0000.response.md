The provided program has a function `func_1` that is intended to replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). Let's analyze the behavior of the function against the problem description:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function checks if `list1` is non-empty. If it is non-empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire contents of `list2` using the slice assignment `list1[-1:] = list2`.
   - If `list1` is empty, it attempts to assign `list2` to `list1`, but this assignment does not affect the original `list1` outside the function because Python lists are mutable and this assignment creates a new local reference to `list2` instead of modifying the original `list1`.

2. **Problem Description Compliance**:
   - The problem description states that the last element of `list1` should be replaced with the elements of `list2`. The function correctly does this when `list1` is non-empty.
   - However, when `list1` is empty, it does not fulfill the requirement of replacing the last element because there is no last element to replace. Moreover, it does not return a modified `list1` as expected; it simply creates a local copy that does not affect the original list.

3. **Conclusion**: 
   - The behavior of the function does not align with the problem description for the case where `list1` is empty. The requirement states that the last element of `list1` should be replaced, but if `list1` is empty, this cannot happen, and the outcome does not meet the intended behavior stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
