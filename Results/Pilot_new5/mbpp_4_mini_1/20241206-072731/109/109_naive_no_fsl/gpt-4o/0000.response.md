Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The description states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not modify the last element; instead, it simply omits it (using `list1[:-1]`) and concatenates it with `list2`.

For example, consider the case where `list1` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `list2` is `[7, 8, 9]`. The expected output, according to the problem description, should be `[1, 3, 7, 8, 9]`, since the last element of `list1` (which is `5`) should be replaced by the elements of `list2`. However, the current implementation will output `[1, 3, 7, 8, 9]`, which is incorrect because it does not replace `5` but rather removes it.

Thus, the function does not meet the specified requirements for all potential cases.
