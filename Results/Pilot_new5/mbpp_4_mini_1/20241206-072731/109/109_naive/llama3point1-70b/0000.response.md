Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logical flaw regarding the case when `list1` is empty. According to the problem description, when `list1` is empty, the function should replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. However, the code attempts to assign `list2` to `list1` in this case, which does not modify `list1` in the caller's context. Therefore, the changes will not reflect outside the function.

For example, if we call the function with:

```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = func_1(list1, list2)
```

The expected behavior would be for `list1` to become `[1, 2, 3]`. However, the actual function will return `None` (as `list1` remains empty). Thus, `list1` remains unchanged after the function call.

Therefore, there are cases where the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
