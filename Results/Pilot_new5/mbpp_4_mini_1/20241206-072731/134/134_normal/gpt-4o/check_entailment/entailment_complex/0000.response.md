Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. However, the implementation simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not correspond to the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n` can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum of even index binomial coefficients} = 2^{(n-1)}
\]

This formula is indeed equal to the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices when considering the expansion of \((1 + 1)^n\) and \((1 - 1)^n\).

However, the function does not calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients; instead, it provides a different interpretation of the required output. The function's return value does not relate to the computation of even index binomial coefficients directly, as it merely computes a power of 2.

For example, when \( n = 4 \):
- The even index binomial coefficients are \( C(4, 0) = 1 \), \( C(4, 2) = 6 \), and \( C(4, 4) = 1 \).
- Their sum is \( 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \), which is correctly calculated by the function (yet does not represent the algorithm's logic).

This discrepancy indicates that while the function produces the correct result for a few specific cases, it does not comply universally with the problem's requirements, thereby leading to its classification as incorrect within the broader context.

Thus, the function does not consistently solve the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
