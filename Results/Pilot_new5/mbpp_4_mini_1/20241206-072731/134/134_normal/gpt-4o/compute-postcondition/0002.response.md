Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). It assumes that `n` is always positive, so there are no checks for non-positive integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `n` is less than 1 (e.g., it will return 1 when `n` is 1 and returns a fractional value for any non-positive input). However, the primary functionality remains to compute \(2^{(n-1)}\). **
