To evaluate the impact of the code, we need to analyze it step by step.

1. The initial state informs us that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is equal to 1 because `i` is odd, and `i` is 2.
2. The code snippet `sum += math.comb(n, i)` calculates the binomial coefficient of `n` choose `i`, where `math.comb(n, i)` gives the value of \(\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}\).
3. Given that `i` is 2, we can find the value of `math.comb(n, 2)` which evaluates to \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
4. Since `sum` was initially 1, after executing the line of code, `sum` will be updated to \(1 + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, we can express the new value of `sum` in relation to `n`.

Overall, the execution will change only the `sum` variable while retaining the values of `n` and `i` as they are.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 2; `sum` is equal to \(1 + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)**.
