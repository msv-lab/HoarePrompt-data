The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)`, which computes the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time. Given that `i` is 0 (an even number), `math.comb(n, 0)` is always 1, as there is exactly one way to choose nothing from `n`. Therefore, `sum` will increase by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0**
