To calculate the new value of `sum`, we first need to evaluate `math.comb(n, i)`, which computes the binomial coefficient "n choose i". Given that `i` is 1, the formula for `math.comb(n, 1)` simplifies to `n`, because choosing 1 object from `n` total options gives exactly `n` ways to do so.

Initially:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

The operation `sum += math.comb(n, i)` updates `sum` as follows:
- `sum` becomes `1 + n`.

No other variables are affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1**.
