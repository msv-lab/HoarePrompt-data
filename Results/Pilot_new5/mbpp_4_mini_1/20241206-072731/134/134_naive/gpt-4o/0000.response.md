To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the function `func_1` in the context of the problem description: "Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients."

The binomial coefficients can be represented by the formula \( C(n, k) \), where \( k \) ranges from 0 to \( n \). The sum of even index binomial coefficients is represented as:

\[
\text{Sum} = C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots
\]

Now, let's analyze the actual implementation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

The function `func_1(n)` returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which is not a correct representation of the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

To illustrate this, we can check specific values:

1. For \( n = 4 \):
   - The even index binomial coefficients are \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - The function returns \( 2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8 \) which is incorrect.

2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - The even index binomial coefficients are \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \).
   - The function returns \( 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \) which is also incorrect.

3. For \( n = 2 \):
   - The even index binomial coefficients are \( C(2, 0) = 1 \).
   - The function returns \( 2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2 \), which is correct in this specific case.

However, as shown in the first two examples, the program does not always yield the correct results for the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for inputs \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 6 \).
