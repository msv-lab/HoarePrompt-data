Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various string inputs:

- For the input 'abcdef', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'a', 'c', and 'e', resulting in 'ace'.
- For 'python', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'p', 't', and 'o', resulting in 'pto'.
- For 'data', the characters at even indices (0, 2) are 'd' and 't', resulting in 'dt'.
- For 'lambs', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'l', 'm', and 's', resulting in 'lms'.

Since all test cases produce the correct outputs and the logic is aligned with the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
