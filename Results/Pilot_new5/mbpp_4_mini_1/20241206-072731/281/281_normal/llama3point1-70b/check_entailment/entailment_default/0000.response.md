The given Python program is designed to find even numbers from a list of integers, as per the problem description. 

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers) in the resulting list. 

Initial assessment:
1. **Correctness for Non-empty Lists**: The function should correctly identify and return all even numbers from a non-empty list of integers.
2. **Edge Case - Empty List**: According to the problem description, if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The list comprehension will simply not iterate over anything and will return `[]`.

Now, checking the Output hints:
- The hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers. They also state that if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.

Based on the analysis:
- The function correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description.
- It handles the edge case of an empty list appropriately by returning an empty list.

Since the function meets the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the input list and handles an empty list as expected by returning an empty list.
