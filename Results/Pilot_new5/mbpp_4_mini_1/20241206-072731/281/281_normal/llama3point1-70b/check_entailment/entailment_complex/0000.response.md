Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, iterates through each integer, and filters out the even numbers using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This means it correctly identifies and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the provided list. 

Additionally, the function handles all potential cases effectively:
- If the input list contains no even numbers, it will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
- If the input list is empty, it will also correctly return an empty list.

Thus, the program behaves as required by the problem description, which is to find and return even numbers from a list of integers.
