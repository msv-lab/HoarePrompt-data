#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers called `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even integers from that list. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
