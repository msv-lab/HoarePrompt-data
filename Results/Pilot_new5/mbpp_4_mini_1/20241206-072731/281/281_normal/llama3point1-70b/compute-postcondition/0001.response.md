After executing the function body, it returns a list containing only the even integers from the input list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers and return a new list that consists of the even integers found in the input list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing only the even integers from that list.**
