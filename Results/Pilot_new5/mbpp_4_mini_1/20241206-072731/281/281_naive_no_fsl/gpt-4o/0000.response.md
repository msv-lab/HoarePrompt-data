Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. 

All provided test cases confirm the behavior of the function:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `[2, 4]`, which correctly identifies the even numbers.
2. For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the output is `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which also correctly identifies all even numbers from the list.
3. For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the output is `[8, 12]`, accurately capturing the even numbers.

I could not think of any potential edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. The function should also work for negative numbers and zero, and it will return an empty list if there are no even numbers present, which adheres to the problem description. 

As such, the function behaves as expected for all evaluated cases.
