Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two numbers as inputs and returns them in a tuple, with the second number first and the first number second. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1(1, 2)`, the output will be `(2, 1)`, which matches the requirement.
- If we call `func_1(-3, 7)`, the output will be `(7, -3)`, which also matches the requirement.
- If we call `func_1(0, 5)`, the output will be `(5, 0)`, again matching the requirement.

The function works correctly for all types of inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Thus, there are no potential edge cases where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
