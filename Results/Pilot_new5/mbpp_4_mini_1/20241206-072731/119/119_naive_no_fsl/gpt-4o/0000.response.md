Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, which is `(b, a)`.

The provided assertions test various cases and all of them return the expected results, confirming that the function behaves correctly for the tested inputs:
- For `func_1(10, 20)`, it returns `(20, 10)` as expected.
- For `func_1(15, 17)`, it returns `(17, 15)` as expected.
- For `func_1(100, 200)`, it returns `(200, 100)` as expected.

Since all the test cases provided in the assertions and the logic of the function itself are correct and account for valid inputs, there are no potential edge cases that cause the program to fail. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
