Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be integers or floats, and returns a tuple in the order specified: `(b, a)`. This matches the requirement to return a tuple with the second number first and the first number second.

The annotation also confirms that the function is intended to return the values of `b` and `a` in that specific order and indicates that there are no edge cases concerning the input types, as the function will return the values regardless of whether they are integers or floats.

Therefore, the function adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the functionality as required.
