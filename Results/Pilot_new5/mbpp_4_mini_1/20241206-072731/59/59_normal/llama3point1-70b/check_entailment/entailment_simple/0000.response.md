Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it always fulfills the criteria:

1. **Merging Lists**: The program uses `list1 + list2 + list3` to concatenate the three input lists into a single list. This ensures that all elements from the three lists are included in the result.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: The use of the `sorted()` function on the concatenated list guarantees that the final list is sorted in ascending order. This meets the requirement of producing a sorted list.

3. **Handling Comparable Elements**: The problem description states that the lists can contain any comparable elements. The `sorted()` function in Python is capable of sorting elements of various types (as long as they are comparable), which makes the function versatile and adherent to the problem requirements.

Therefore, since the program merges three lists and returns a single sorted list as specified, it is correct.
