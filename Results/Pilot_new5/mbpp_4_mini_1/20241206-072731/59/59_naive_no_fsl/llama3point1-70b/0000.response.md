Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the three input lists and then applies the `sorted()` function to the concatenated list. 

This approach is valid because:

1. **Concatenation**: The `+` operator properly combines the three lists into one.
2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function sorts the combined list in ascending order.

The code handles various cases, including empty lists and lists with different data types (as long as they are all comparable). For example:

- If all lists are empty: `func_1([], [], [])` returns `[]`, which is correct.
- If one list is empty: `func_1([3, 2], [], [1])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
- If all lists contain numbers: `func_1([3, 1], [4, 2], [5])` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is correct.

Since I cannot find an example where the program does not perform as expected according to the problem description, the implementation is deemed correct.
