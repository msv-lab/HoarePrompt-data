Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly merges three lists and sorts the combined result into a single sorted list. It uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function which ensures that the output is sorted regardless of the order of elements in the input lists. The program handles empty lists as well, and it can accommodate lists of different lengths or containing different types of elements (as long as they are all comparable). Thus, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
