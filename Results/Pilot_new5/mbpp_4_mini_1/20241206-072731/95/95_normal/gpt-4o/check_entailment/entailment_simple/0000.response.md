Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single argument `s`, which is expected to be a string. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Count Method**: Inside the function, the `s.count('std')` method is used. The `count` method of a string accurately counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string `s`. This is exactly what the problem requires.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test various cases:
    - The string 'letstdlenstdporstd' contains 'std' 3 times, and the assertion checks for this.
    - The string 'truststdsolensporsd' contains 'std' 1 time.
    - The string 'makestdsostdworthit' contains 'std' 2 times.
    - The string 'stds' contains 'std' 1 time.
    - An empty string '' contains 'std' 0 times.

   Each of these assertions will pass based on the expected outcomes, further confirming that the function behaves as intended.

Thus, the program satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description, making it correct.
