Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string using the built-in string method `count()`. The provided assertions test various scenarios, including strings containing multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with a single occurrence, strings without 'std', and an empty string. All assertions are valid and would return the expected counts, confirming that the function behaves as intended for the described problem. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
