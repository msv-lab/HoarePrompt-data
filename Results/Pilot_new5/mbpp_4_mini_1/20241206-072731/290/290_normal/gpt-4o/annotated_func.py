#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length of at least 1.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True because the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character of the string 's' contains the character 'z'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, and the substring `s[1:-1]` does not contain the character 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns `True` if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `s` has a length of 1 or 2, the substring will be empty, and thus the function will return `False`.
