To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's start with the problem description and the code:

**Problem description:** Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns `True` if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `s` has a length of 1 or 2, the substring will be empty, and thus the function will return `False`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function checks for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character to the second-to-last character of the string `s`. If 'z' is found in that range, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
2. The function seems to handle strings of length 1 and 2 correctly since slicing `s[1:-1]` will be empty for those cases, resulting in `False` being returned.
3. For strings longer than 2 characters, the function should work as described.

### Edge Cases:
- If `s` is a string of length 1 (e.g., `'a'` or `'z'`), the function should return `False`.
- If `s` is a string of length 2 (e.g., `'az'` or `'za'`), the function should also return `False`.
- For strings that contain 'z' only at the beginning (e.g., `'zabc'`) or at the end (e.g., `'abc z'`), the function should return `False`.
- For a string that contains 'z' in the middle (e.g., `'azbcd'` or `'abcde z'`), the function should return `True`.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints correctly summarize how the function works, stating that it checks for 'z' in the substring from index 1 to index -2. It also notes that for strings of length 1 or 2, the substring is empty, leading to a return value of `False`.

### Conclusion:
After considering the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the function appears to work as intended. All edge cases seem to be handled correctly, and the hints align with the code's behavior. 

Therefore, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
