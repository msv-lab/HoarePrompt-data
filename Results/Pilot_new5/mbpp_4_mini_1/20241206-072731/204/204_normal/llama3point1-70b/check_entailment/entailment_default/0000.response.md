The provided code defines a function that checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days. It correctly checks if the input month number `n` is present in the list of months with 31 days (`months_31_days`).

However, the code does not validate whether `n` is within the valid range of month numbers (1 to 12). If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 12, the function would return `False`, which may not reflect the intended behavior of the problem description. For example, an input of `0` or `13` would yield `False`, but this could be misleading, as `0` and `13` are not valid month numbers. The problem description states that the function should check whether the month number contains 31 days or not, but it does not specify how to handle invalid month numbers.

The output hints also note that the code does not validate whether `n` is within the range of 1 to 12, confirming the issue with invalid inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle edge cases where the input month number `n` is outside the valid range (1 to 12). For instance, if `n` is `0` or `13`, the function will return `False`, but these inputs should ideally be managed in a way that reflects their invalidity.
