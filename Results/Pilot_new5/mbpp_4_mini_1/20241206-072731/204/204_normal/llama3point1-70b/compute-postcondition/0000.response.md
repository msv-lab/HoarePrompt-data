The variable `months_31_days` is assigned a list of integers representing the months that have 31 days. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer representing a month number, where 1 <= n <= 12. The values of `n` remain unchanged, and the list is created without affecting `n`. The output reflects the new variable that has been introduced.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing a month number (1 <= n <= 12), `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
