The provided program implements a sorting algorithm, specifically a variation of selection sort that uses a series of reversals to sort the input list. The function takes a list `arr` as input and sorts it in non-decreasing order, which aligns with the problem description of sorting a list of elements.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. The program correctly identifies the maximum element within the unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`) and moves it to its correct position by reversing portions of the list.
2. The outer loop iterates from the length of the list down to 1, ensuring that the entire list is processed.
3. The inner checks and reversals correctly position the maximum elements sequentially, ultimately leading to a sorted list.
4. The program accounts for edge cases: if the list is empty (`n == 0`), it returns the unchanged empty list, as expected.

### Conclusion:
Since the program consistently sorts the list in non-decreasing order for any input, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
