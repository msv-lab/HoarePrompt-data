The code reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr`, where `size` is `n - 1` and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. Since `max_index` is not equal to 0, at least one element is being reversed. The state of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remains unchanged, but the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are now in reverse order.

Output State: **`arr` is the list with the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]**.
