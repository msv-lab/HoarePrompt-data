The code assigns the value of `max_index` to the index of the maximum element found in the sublist `arr[:size]`. Since `size` is `n - 1`, the sublist contains the first `n - 1` elements of `arr`. The value of `max_index` will be the index of the maximum value within this sublist of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
