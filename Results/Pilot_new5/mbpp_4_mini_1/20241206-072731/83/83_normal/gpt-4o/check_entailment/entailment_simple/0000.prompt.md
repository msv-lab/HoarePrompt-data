You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list with elements sorted in non-increasing order, `n` is the length of the original list, and `curr_size` will be 1 after the loop completes. The value of `max_index` will correspond to the index of the maximum remaining element in the subarray considered until the last iteration. If `n` was less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' which is sorted in non-increasing order and unchanged if 'n' is less than or equal to 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer representing the last index of the list to be reversed, and start is implicitly defined as starting from 0.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is now less than the original value of `end`, and the elements of `arr` have been reversed from the original arrangement between the indices 0 and the original value of `end`. If the original value of `end` was odd, the middle element remains unchanged; if it was even, all elements are swapped.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list, and arr is a list of elements with at least n elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements with at least `n` elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n` elements.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr' from the first 'n' elements.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
