Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description of sorting a list of elements. Specifically, there are two main issues:

1. **Global Variable Dependency**: The `find_max_index` and `flip` functions rely on a global variable `arr`, which is not explicitly passed as an argument. This design choice can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if `arr` is not defined or modified elsewhere in the code.

2. **Error Handling**: The `flip` and `find_max_index` functions do not handle cases where `end` exceeds the length of `arr` or where `arr` is empty. For example, if `arr` is empty, calling `func_1([])` would result in an `IndexError` when trying to find a maximum index or when flipping elements.

Due to these issues, the program does not reliably sort lists as required by the problem description. For instance, if we call `func_1([])`, it should return an empty list but may instead raise an error, demonstrating that the implementation is not robust for all potential cases.
