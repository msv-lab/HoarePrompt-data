Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements of any type, and `n` is greater than 2. If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, the array is modified by a flip operation at index `n - 3`. The current size of the array is `curr_size`, which is `n - 2`, and `max_index` may have changed due to previous operations.***
