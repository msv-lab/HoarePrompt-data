Output State: **`arr` is a list with elements sorted in non-increasing order, `n` is the length of the original list, and `curr_size` will be 1 after the loop completes. The value of `max_index` will correspond to the index of the maximum remaining element in the subarray considered until the last iteration. If `n` was less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `arr` remains unchanged.**
