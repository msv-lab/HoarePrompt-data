According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` must be updated to reflect the next iteration.

Since `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, it will become `2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `2`. The condition about `arr` indicates that it has at least `n` elements, which implies that `arr` can accommodate the next index.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of elements with at least `n` elements, `i` is 2, `max_index` remains updated if `arr[2]` is greater than `arr[0]` (although the specific value of `max_index` isn't necessary here as it will be determined in the loop body).**
