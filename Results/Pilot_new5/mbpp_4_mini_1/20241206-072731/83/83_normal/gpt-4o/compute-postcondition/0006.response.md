The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. Since the initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `i` is 2, the value of `max_index` now becomes 2. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of elements with at least `n` elements, `i` is 2, `max_index` is 2**
