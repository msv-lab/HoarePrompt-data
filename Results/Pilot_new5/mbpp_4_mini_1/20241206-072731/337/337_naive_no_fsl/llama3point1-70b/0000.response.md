To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its implementation in relation to the problem description: finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

The program uses the following logic:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

This implementation iterates through each element `i` in the list `lst`, using `lst.count(i)` to check if the element appears only once in the list. If it does, that element is included in the summation.

### Analysis:

1. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies non-repeated elements by checking their count in the list.
   - It sums these non-repeated elements, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `lst.count(i)` inside a generator expression causes the function to run in O(n^2) time complexity since `count()` itself is O(n) and is called for each element in the list.
   - However, this does not affect the correctness of the output; it only affects performance.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty list `[]` should return `0` since there are no elements to sum.
   - A list with all identical elements, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`, should also return `0` as there are no non-repeated elements.
   - A list with some repeated and some non-repeated elements should correctly return the sum of non-repeated elements.

### Example Cases:
- Input: `[]` → Output: `0` (correct)
- Input: `[1, 1, 1]` → Output: `0` (correct)
- Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]` → Output: `4` (sum of non-repeated elements 1 and 3)
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]` → Output: `0` (correct, as there are no non-repeated elements)

Since the program handles all these cases correctly, I can conclude that the implementation meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
