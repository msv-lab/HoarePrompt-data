Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that the function must find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. 

The program uses `sum(set(lst))`, which calculates the sum of all unique elements in the list. However, this approach includes elements that may appear multiple times but are still counted only once, which does not satisfy the requirement to find "non-repeated" elements.

For example, in the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`, not `21` (as the assertion incorrectly expects). The element `1`, which appears multiple times, should not contribute to the sum since it's repeated.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description accurately, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
