#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of the unique integers in the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers in the list. If `lst` is empty, it returns 0 since the sum of an empty set is 0.
