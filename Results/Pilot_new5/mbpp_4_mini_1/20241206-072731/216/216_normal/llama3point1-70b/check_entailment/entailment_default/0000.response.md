To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the analysis:

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check if the given list contains consecutive numbers. 

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if `lst` is a sorted list of consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`. It checks for consecutive integers by ensuring that the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1 and verifies that there are no duplicate values by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list. Additionally, it notes that if `lst` is empty or contains only one element, the function will return `False`, since there would be no consecutive integers.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Sorting and Checking Differences**: 
   - The program sorts the list and checks the difference between each pair of adjacent elements to see if they are exactly 1.
   - It also checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the list is empty, the program will return `False` since there are no elements to check for consecutiveness.
   - If the list contains a single element, the program will also return `False`, as there are no pairs to compare for consecutiveness.
   - If the numbers in the list have gaps (e.g., [1, 2, 4]), the function should return `False`.

### Output Hints Verification:
- The output hints are consistent with the code. The hints correctly state that the function checks for a sorted list of consecutive integers without duplicates. They also correctly mention that if the list is empty or contains a single element, the return value will be `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements as stated in the problem description for all potential cases:
- It handles empty lists and lists with a single element by returning `False`.
- It correctly identifies gaps in the sequence by checking if the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1, and it checks for duplicates.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements as described, the code appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
