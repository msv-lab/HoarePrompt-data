To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function.

The problem description requires us to check if a given list contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers differ by 1, and the list should not have duplicates, since duplicates would violate the definition of consecutive numbers.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program sorts the input list `lst`.
2. It uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check if every consecutive pair of numbers in the sorted list has a difference of exactly 1.
3. Additionally, it checks if the length of the original list is equal to the length of the set of the list, ensuring that there are no duplicates.

Now, let’s consider potential edge cases to see if the program behaves correctly:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list should return `True`, as there are no numbers to violate the condition of being consecutive.
   - Input: `[]` → Output: `True` (Correct)

2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element should also return `True`, as there are no numbers to compare for consecutiveness.
   - Input: `[5]` → Output: `True` (Correct)

3. **List with Non-Consecutive Numbers**: A list containing non-consecutive numbers should return `False`.
   - Input: `[1, 3, 2]` → Output: `False` (Correct)

4. **List with Duplicates**: A list with duplicates should return `False`.
   - Input: `[1, 1, 2, 3]` → Output: `False` (Correct)

5. **List with Consecutive Numbers**: A list with consecutive numbers should return `True`.
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` → Output: `True` (Correct)

6. **Negative Numbers**: A list with negative consecutive numbers should also return `True`.
   - Input: `[-3, -2, -1, 0]` → Output: `True` (Correct)

7. **Mixed Positive and Negative Consecutive Numbers**: A list with mixed positive and negative consecutive numbers should return `False`.
   - Input: `[-1, 0, 1, 2]` → Output: `True` (Incorrect, as the expected behavior is that it should return `False` since `-1` is not consecutive with `0`).

After considering the above cases, we find that the program incorrectly handles the case of mixed positive and negative consecutive numbers. The expected output should indicate that these numbers are not consecutive. Since the program fails for at least one input case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
