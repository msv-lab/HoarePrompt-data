To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
2. It iterates through each unique digit in `str_n`.
3. For each digit, it checks how many times that digit appears in `str_n` using `str_n.count(digit)`.
4. It compares this count to the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
5. If the count exceeds the digit, it returns `False`. If none of the digits exceed their respective counts, it returns `True`.

### Edge Case:
Let's consider a case like `n = 222`. 

- The frequency of the digit `2` is `3`, and since `2` (which represents the digit) is equal to `2`, we would expect the function to return `False` because `3` (the frequency of `2`) is greater than `2`.

Now let's consider a case like `n = 121`. 

- The digit `1` occurs twice, and since `1` (the digit) is equal to `1`, it is valid.
- The digit `2` occurs once, and since `2` (the digit) is equal to `2`, it is valid.
- Therefore, the function would return `True` for this case.

### Counter Example:
In the original analysis, we found that `n = 222` should return `False` because the digit `2` appears `3` times, which is greater than the digit itself (`2`). 

Since the code does not handle this case correctly, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to correctly check the frequency of the digit against the digit itself for cases where the frequency exceeds the value of the digit.
