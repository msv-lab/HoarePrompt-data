Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program checks the frequency of each digit.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. The program uses the `str_n.count(digit)` method to count the occurrences of each digit in the string representation of the number. This correctly counts how many times each digit appears in the number.
2. However, the comparison `if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit)` checks if the count of the digit exceeds its integer value. This is logically sound, but it fails to adequately handle cases where `digit` is `'0'`. 

For example:
- If the input `n` is `1000`, the digit `'0'` appears 3 times in `1000`, but the integer value of `0` is 0. Since 3 is greater than 0, the function will return `False`, which is correct.
- However, the program should also return `False` for any digit appearing more times than its value, but the approach does not correctly handle cases where digits appear at their maximum allowed frequency.

### Example Cases:
- For `n = 121`, the digit `1` appears 2 times (which is greater than 1), so it should return `False`, which it does correctly.
- For `n = 112`, the digit `1` appears twice (which is equal to 1) and digit `2` appears once (which is equal to 2), so it should return `True`, which it does correctly.

However, for a case like `n = 222`, the digit `2` appears 3 times, which is greater than 2, leading to a false positive.

Therefore, while the logic appears correct in some cases, the program does not adequately cover all edge cases and may lead to incorrect results due to its counting mechanism. Thus, it does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case.
