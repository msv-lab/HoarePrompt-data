According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `str_n`. Since `str_n` is a string that represents the integer `n`, the loop iterates over each character in `str_n`. The last iteration has `digit` as the last character of `str_n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If the loop is to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `str_n` has at least one more character left for the next iteration, which would imply that `digit` should move to the next character in `str_n`.

Thus, we must adjust the state to reflect that the next character in `str_n` will be the next `digit`. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must be a string representing `n` and is not empty, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, `digit` is the next character in `str_n**.
