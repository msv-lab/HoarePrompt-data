The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple return points: 

- In Case_1, it returns `False`, indicating that certain conditions are not met.
- In Case_2, it also returns `False`.
- In Case_3, it again returns `False`.
- In Case_4, it returns `True`, confirming that the count of each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `True` if the count of each digit in `n` meets specific criteria; otherwise, it returns `False` under various conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns True if the count of each digit in the string representation of n is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. If the conditions do not meet the requirements, it returns False.**
