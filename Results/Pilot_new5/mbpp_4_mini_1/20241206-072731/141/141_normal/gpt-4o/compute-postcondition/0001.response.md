The `frequency` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary. This impacts the program by introducing a new variable, but it does not change the values of the existing variables `n` and `digit_str`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new variable.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`; `frequency` is an empty dictionary.**
