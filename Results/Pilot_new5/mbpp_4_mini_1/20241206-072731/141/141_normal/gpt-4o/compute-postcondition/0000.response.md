`digit_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is only being converted to a string for `digit_str`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`.**
