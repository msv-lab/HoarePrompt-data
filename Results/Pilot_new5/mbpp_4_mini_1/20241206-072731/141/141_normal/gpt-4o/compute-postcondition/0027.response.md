Output State: **`frequency` is a dictionary containing the count of each digit in `digit_str`; if `n` is 0, then `frequency` is `{'0': 1}`. For each digit in `frequency`, its corresponding count does not exceed the integer value of that digit. If any count exceeds its digit, the function returns False; otherwise, it completes without returning anything.**
