The variable `frequency[digit]` is assigned the value `1`. This means that the frequency of the character `digit` is set to 1. If `digit` was already present in the `frequency` dictionary, its value would be overwritten to 1. Hence, the state of `frequency` changes accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected, and since `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, all those conditions still hold true.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.**
