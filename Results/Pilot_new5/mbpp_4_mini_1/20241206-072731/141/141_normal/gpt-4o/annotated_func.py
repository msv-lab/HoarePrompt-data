#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `frequency` is a dictionary containing the count of each digit in `digit_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0, `frequency` will be `{'0': 1}`; otherwise, `frequency` will reflect the frequency of each digit present in `n`.
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `frequency` is a dictionary containing the count of each digit in `digit_str`; if `n` is 0, then `frequency` is `{'0': 1}`. For each digit in `frequency`, its corresponding count does not exceed the integer value of that digit. If any count exceeds its digit, the function returns False; otherwise, it completes without returning anything.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all counts in the frequency dictionary do not exceed their corresponding digit values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, and counts the frequency of each digit. It returns False if any digit's count exceeds its integer value; otherwise, it returns True. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 correctly, returning True since the count of '0' does not exceed its integer value. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities.
