Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement by filtering the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension, which is an efficient and Pythonic way to achieve this.

I tested the function with several assert statements, and all of them passed:

1. For `n = 170`, the result is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly includes all entries with values greater than or equal to 170.
2. For `n = 180`, the result is `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly includes entries with values greater than or equal to 180.
3. For `n = 190`, the result is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly includes only the entry with a value of 190.

Since I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs where the function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct. Therefore, I am confident in stating that the program correctly fulfills the requirements.
