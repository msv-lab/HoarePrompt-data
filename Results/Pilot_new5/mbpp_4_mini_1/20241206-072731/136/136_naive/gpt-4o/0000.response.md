Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the dictionary items and checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function produces the expected outputs for the given test cases. 

1. For `n = 170`, only entries with values 175, 180, and 190 remain, which is correct.
2. For `n = 180`, the entries with values 180 and 190 remain, which is also correct.
3. For `n = 190`, only the entry with value 190 remains, which is again correct.

All potential cases that I could think of are handled properly, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
