Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, it should return the occurrence and positions of all instances of the substring, but the current implementation only finds the first occurrence of the substring.

For example, consider the following input:

```python
string = "abcabc"
substring = "abc"
```

In this case, the expected output should include both occurrences of "abc": 

```
("abc", 0, 2)  # first occurrence
("abc", 3, 5)  # second occurrence
```

However, the current implementation will only return `(substring, 0, 2)` for the first occurrence and disregard the second occurrence entirely.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
