Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description as it only finds the first occurrence of the substring and its position. The problem description requires the function to find all occurrences and positions of the substrings within the string. 

As it stands, `func_1` uses the `find` method, which will only locate the first occurrence of the substring. For example, in the string 'python programming, python language', if the substring 'python' appears multiple times, the function will only return the position of the first instance. Additionally, if there are no matches, it correctly returns `None`.

To meet the problem description, the function should be modified to find and return all occurrences of the substring within the main string, along with their respective positions, or return `None` if there are no matches. Thus, the current implementation cannot be considered correct as it does not satisfy the requirement of finding all occurrences of the substring within the main string.
