The variable `start` is assigned the value of `string.find(substring)`, which returns the lowest index in `string` where `substring` is found. Since both `string` and `substring` are non-empty, `start` will be an integer indicating the starting index of `substring` in `string` or -1 if `substring` is not found. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is an integer representing the lowest index of `substring` in `string` or -1 if not found.**
