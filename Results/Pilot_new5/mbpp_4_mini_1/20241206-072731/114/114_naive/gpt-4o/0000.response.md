Correctness: **True**.

The provided program `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The implementation uses the `count` method of tuples, which accurately returns the number of times the specified element appears within the tuple. 

The assertions provided in the code also demonstrate the correct functionality for various cases:

1. The first assertion checks for an element (4) that does not exist in the tuple, and it correctly returns 0.
2. The second assertion checks for the element (10), which appears 3 times, and it correctly returns 3.
3. The third assertion checks for the element (8), which appears 4 times, and it correctly returns 4.

Since the program behaves as expected for the given examples and adheres to the problem description, it is considered correct.
