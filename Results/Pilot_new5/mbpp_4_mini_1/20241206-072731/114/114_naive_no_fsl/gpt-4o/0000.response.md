Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(tup, element)` is correctly implemented to count the occurrences of `element` in the given tuple `tup`. The method `tup.count(element)` is a built-in Python method that accurately counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`.

The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected for the test cases:
- For the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `4`, the count is `0`, which is correct.
- For the same tuple and the element `10`, the count is `3`, which is correct.
- For the same tuple and the element `8`, the count is `4`, which is correct.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the function fails to handle according to the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements, and I conclude that it is correct.
