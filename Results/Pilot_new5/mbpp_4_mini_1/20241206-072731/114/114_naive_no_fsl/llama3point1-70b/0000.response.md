Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple and an element as input and uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of the specified element. 

This method will return the correct count of occurrences, even if the element is not present (returning 0), or if the tuple is empty (also returning 0). It also correctly handles different data types, counting occurrences of integers, strings, and other elements consistently. 

Since all potential edge cases have been considered and the code behaves as expected in these scenarios, the implementation is correct.
