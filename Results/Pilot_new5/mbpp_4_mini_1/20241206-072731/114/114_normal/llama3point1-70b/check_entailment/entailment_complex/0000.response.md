Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Types**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`). It is explicitly stated that `elem` can be of any data type, which is supported by the `count` method of the tuple.

2. **Element Counting**: The program uses the `count` method of the tuple, which accurately counts the number of occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Handling Non-existent Elements**: The program correctly handles cases where `elem` is not present in the tuple by returning `0`, which aligns with the expectation set out in the problem description.

4. **Correctness of Return Value**: The function returns the count of occurrences directly, ensuring that the output is both correct and efficient.

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements, making it a correct solution.
