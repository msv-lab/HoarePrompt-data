Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if the number `n` is odd (i.e., has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2) and `False` if the number is even (i.e., has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). 

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the logic fails for any integer input, the function accurately meets the requirement of identifying odd parity for all potential inputs.
