Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines if the parity of the given number `n` is odd. It does this by checking if the result of `n % 2` is not equal to zero, which is the correct way to check for odd numbers. 

The provided assertions confirm the function's correctness for the given test cases:
- For `func_1(12)`, since 12 is even, it correctly returns `False`.
- For `func_1(7)`, since 7 is odd, it correctly returns `True`.
- For `func_1(10)`, since 10 is even, it correctly returns `False`.

Since all test cases are handled correctly and there are no potential edge cases that the program fails to address, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
