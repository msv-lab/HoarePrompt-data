#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, and False if n is an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. There are no edge cases or missing functionality, as the function correctly handles all integer inputs.
