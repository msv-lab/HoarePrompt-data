The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks whether the parity of the integer `n` is odd by returning `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if `n` is even.

Upon reviewing the problem description, it states that the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function seems to align with this description because it directly checks the condition for odd numbers. Additionally, it handles all integer inputs (both positive and negative), including zero.

Next, considering the output hints, they confirm that the function indeed checks for odd integers and returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. The hints state that there are no edge cases or missing functionality, which supports the original assessment that the function correctly handles all integer inputs.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the output hints, and there are no potential edge cases mentioned or found where the code fails to meet the requirements:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly identifies odd integers by using the modulo operator and follows the problem description without missing any edge cases or conditions.
