Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if `n` is even. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.

Here is the reasoning:

1. **Correctness of Logic**: 
   - The expression `n % 2 != 0` effectively checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
   - If `n` is odd, the remainder is 1, making the expression evaluate to `True`.
   - If `n` is even, the remainder is 0, making the expression evaluate to `False`.
   
2. **Comprehensive Handling**: 
   - The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers, zero, and positive integers, as the modulo operation is well-defined for all integers.

3. **No Edge Cases or Missing Functionality**: 
   - The function correctly captures the essence of the problem description without any omissions.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements set forth in the problem description, confirming that it is correct.
