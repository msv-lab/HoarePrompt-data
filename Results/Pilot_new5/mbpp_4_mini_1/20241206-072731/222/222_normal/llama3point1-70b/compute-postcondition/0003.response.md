The code `result += char` appends the value of `char` to `result`. The initial state indicates that `result` is an empty string and `char` is an uppercase character (specifically the first character of `s`). After executing the code, `result` will contain the uppercase character `char`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `s`, `result` is equal to `char` (an uppercase character).
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `s`, `result` is equal to `char` (an uppercase character)**
