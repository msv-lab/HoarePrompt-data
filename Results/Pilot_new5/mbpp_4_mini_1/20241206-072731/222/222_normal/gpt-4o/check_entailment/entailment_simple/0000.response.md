Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. The task is to "remove lowercase substrings from a given string", which implies that all contiguous segments of lowercase letters should be removed from the string. 

However, the provided function `func_1` only filters out individual lowercase characters and retains the uppercase characters, which does not achieve the intended behavior of removing complete lowercase substrings. For example, given the input `'aBcDef'`, the correct output should be `'BDF'` (removing the lowercase substrings `'a'`, `'c'`, `'e'`, and `'f'`), but the current implementation would return `BCD`, which does not meet the requirement of the problem description.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the specifications of the problem.
