To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description ("Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string"), we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its implementation.

The program attempts to remove lowercase characters from the input string by using a list comprehension that includes only uppercase characters. The function is structured as follows:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```

Now, let's evaluate whether this function meets the requirements set out in the problem statement. The requirement is to remove all lowercase substrings, which implies that any lowercase letters present in the string should be excluded from the output.

### Testing the function:

1. For the input `'PYTHon'`, the function should return `'PYTH'`, which matches the expected output.
2. For the input `'FInD'`, the function should return `'FID'`, which also matches the expected output.
3. For the input `'STRinG'`, the function should return `'STRG'`, which again matches.

### Potential Cases:

However, the problem statement does not specify that only uppercase letters should remain. It simply states to "remove lowercase substrings." If we interpret "removing lowercase substrings" literally, it could suggest that all lowercase letters should be removed, and the remaining string could potentially contain spaces, numbers, or punctuation.

For instance, consider the input:

- **Input:** `'hello WORLD 123!'`
  - The expected output, if we strictly apply the removal of lowercase substrings, should be `' WORLD 123!'`, where all the lowercase letters are removed but uppercase letters and other characters remain.
  - The function would return `'WORLD'`, which is not correct according to the interpretation of the problem description as it does not keep non-lowercase characters that are not uppercase letters.

### Conclusion:

The function does not adhere to the problem description in all scenarios, particularly when dealing with strings that contain a mix of lowercase, uppercase, and other characters. It fails to correctly keep characters that are neither uppercase nor lowercase.

Correctness: **False**
