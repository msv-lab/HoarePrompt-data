Correctness: **False**.

The function is meant to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the examples provided in assertions suggest the function should also work with mixed-case characters. The function currently only retains uppercase characters and removes all lowercase characters, which does not align with the intention of removing lowercase substrings (which could imply entire segments of the string that are lowercase). 

For example, if we test the string `func_1('teSting')`, the expected output should be `T` (removing the lowercase substring `esting`), but the function would return `T` instead, which is partially correct but does not fully meet the problem description of removing entire lowercase segments.

Thus, the program fails to correctly interpret the problem description regarding "substrings."
