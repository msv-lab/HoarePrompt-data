The value of `n` is modified by the operation `n //= 10`, which performs floor division on `n` by 10. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the result of this operation will also be non-negative. The value of `total` remains unchanged, as it is simply equal to `n % 10`, which will still hold after the modification of `n`. The output state reflects the updated value of `n` after the floor division.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and is now equal to `n // 10`; `total` is equal to the remainder of the division of the original `n` by 10.**
