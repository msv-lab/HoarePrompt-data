According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means `n` can be 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute at least once, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
