The value of `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to it. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 10, the value of `n % 10` will be the last digit of `n`, which is between 0 and 9. Therefore, `total` will increase by this last digit.

The state of `total` changes as follows:
- Previous value of `total` (calculated from the original `n` as `n % 10`) will be updated to `total + (n % 10)`.

The states of the other variables (`n`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10`.**
