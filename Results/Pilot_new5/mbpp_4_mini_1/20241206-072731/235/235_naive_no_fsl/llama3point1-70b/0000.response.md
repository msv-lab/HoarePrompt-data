Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It first converts the integer to a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit, which is then converted back to an integer to calculate the sum using the built-in `sum()` function. 

Let's consider potential cases:

1. **Case with a single digit**: `func_1(5)` returns `5`, which is correct.
2. **Case with multiple digits**: `func_1(123)` returns `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is correct.
3. **Case with zero**: `func_1(0)` returns `0`, which is correct as the sum of digits of zero is zero.
4. **Case with a large number**: `func_1(9876543210)` returns `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 45`, which is correct.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases, I conclude that the program is correct.
