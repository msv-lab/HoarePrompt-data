#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples in 'tuples'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. It returns a list of averages, with each average calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples. There are no checks for empty tuples or tuples with uneven lengths, which could lead to errors or unexpected results if the input does not meet these assumptions.
