According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num_elements`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `num_elements` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num_elements` must be greater than 1.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` now includes `avg`**
