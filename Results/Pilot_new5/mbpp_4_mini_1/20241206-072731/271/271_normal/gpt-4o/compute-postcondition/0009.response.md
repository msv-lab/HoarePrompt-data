`averages` is updated by appending the current value of `avg`. Since `avg` is already calculated as equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, we can deduce that the `averages` list will now include this new average value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` includes the updated `avg` value.**
