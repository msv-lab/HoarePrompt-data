The code `averages.append(avg)` is used to add the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The previous value of `avg` is defined as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and this value is added to the `averages` list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes the updated value `avg`.**
