To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it properly implements the described functionality. The problem requires the function to take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

1. **Understanding the logic**: The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the tuple of tuples. This means that it groups the values at corresponding positions in each tuple together. For example, if the input is `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, then `zip(*tuples)` would produce `((1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6))`.

2. **Calculating the average**: The program then calculates the average for each group of values using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`, which is correct as long as `len(tuples)` is not zero.

3. **Edge cases**: We need to consider potential edge cases such as:
   - An empty input, i.e., `func_1(())`. This would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `len(tuples)` would be zero, leading to division by zero.
   - A case with tuples of different lengths. For instance, `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))` would also raise an error because the lists produced by `zip(*tuples)` would be of different lengths, hence causing an issue with the summation.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect as it does not handle the edge cases of empty input and tuples of different lengths. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will raise an error for cases like `func_1(())` (empty input) or `(1, 2), (3, 4, 5)` (tuples of different lengths).
