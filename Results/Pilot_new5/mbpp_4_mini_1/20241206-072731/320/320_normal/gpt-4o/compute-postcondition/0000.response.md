The code creates a set from the list `nums`, which removes any duplicate values, and then sorts that set to create a new sorted list of unique integers. The previous values of `nums` are not affected, and a new variable `unique_nums` is introduced.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
