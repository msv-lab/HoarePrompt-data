Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list. While the function attempts to handle unique values by converting the list to a set and returning the second element of the sorted unique values, it fails in certain scenarios.

1. The function returns `None` if there are not at least two unique numbers, which is correct, but the problem description states to find the second smallest number in a list. The program seems to ignore cases where there are two or more identical numbers. For example, in the case of `func_1([2, 2])`, the expected behavior is unclear; the example asserts that the return value should be `None`, which may not align with the notion of "second smallest." If we strictly follow the concept of finding the second smallest, even in a list with duplicates, it would ideally return the same number (if that's the second smallest) or some indication that there is no second smallest (e.g., returning `None`).

2. The examples provided in the assertions might not cover all edge cases. For example, it doesn't account for the case of negative numbers or the scenario where all elements are the same, which may lead users to expect different behavior.

Thus, the program does not consistently fulfill the requirement of finding the "second smallest number" in all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is not completely correct as per the problem description.
