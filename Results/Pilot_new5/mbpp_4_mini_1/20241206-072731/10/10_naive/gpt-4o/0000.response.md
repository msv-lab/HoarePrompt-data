Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \). The base area is calculated as \( 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). 

The assertions provided test the function with various valid inputs and confirm that the function correctly computes the volume:

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the base area is \( 0.5 \times 10 \times 8 = 40 \), and the volume is \( 40 \times 6 = 240 \).
2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the base area is \( 0.5 \times 3 \times 2 = 3 \), and the volume is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).
3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the base area is \( 0.5 \times 1 \times 2 = 1 \), and the volume is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

All tested cases align with the expected outputs, indicating the function behaves correctly within the provided examples. Further, the function should work for any positive values of base, height, and length, as they logically fit the formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

Thus, no counter-examples can be derived that would show the function not working as expected, confirming its correctness.
