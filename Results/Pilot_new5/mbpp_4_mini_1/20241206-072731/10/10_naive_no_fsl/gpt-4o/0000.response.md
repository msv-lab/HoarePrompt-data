Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the formula for the volume. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be computed as:

\[ V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \]

Where the base area of a triangle is given by:

\[ \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \]

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. It computes the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle and then multiplies that by the `length` of the prism to get the volume.

The assertions provided in the program also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the expected volume is \( 0.5 \times 10 \times 8 \times 6 = 240 \), which matches the assertion.
2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the expected volume is \( 0.5 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 6 \), which matches the assertion.
3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the expected volume is \( 0.5 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \), which matches the assertion.

The program appears to handle the logic correctly, and I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs for which it would fail to compute the volume of a triangular prism as defined in the problem statement. Thus, it meets all requirements laid out in the description.
