The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are non-negative float or integer values. The function calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is given by the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative values for `base`, `height`, and `length`, and return the volume of the triangular prism calculated using these dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length, all of which are non-negative floats or integers, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
