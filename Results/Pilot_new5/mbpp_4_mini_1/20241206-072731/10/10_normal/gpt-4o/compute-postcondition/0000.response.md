The variable `base_area` is assigned the value of 0.5 multiplied by `base` and `height`. Given that `base` and `height` are non-negative, `base_area` will also be non-negative. The states of `base`, `height`, and `length` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`base` is a non-negative float or integer representing the area of the triangular base, `height` is a non-negative float or integer representing the height of the triangular prism, `length` is a non-negative float or integer representing the length of the prism, `base_area` is equal to 0.5 * `base` * `height`.**
