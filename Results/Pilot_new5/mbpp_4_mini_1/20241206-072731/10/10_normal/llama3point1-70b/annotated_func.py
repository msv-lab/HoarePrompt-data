#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive real numbers representing the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base b multiplied by height h divided by 2) multiplied by length l, where b, h, and l are positive real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. There are no checks for negative or zero values for `b`, `h`, or `l`, which could lead to incorrect or undefined volume calculations.
