Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the given problem description. The formula used in the function is appropriate for determining the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by the area of the triangular base multiplied by the length of the prism.

Here's why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. The problem description specifies that these should be positive real numbers, which is handled by the function.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Area of triangular base} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   The area of the triangular base is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{b \times h}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the volume becomes:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
   \]
   This is exactly what the function implements with the return statement:
   ```python
   return b * h / 2 * l
   ```

3. **Correctness for All Cases**: The function correctly follows the mathematical formula for the volume of a triangular prism and will return the correct result for any positive real numbers provided as inputs. Since the inputs are specified to be positive real numbers, there are no edge cases where the function would fail or produce incorrect results.

Given this analysis, the program consistently follows the problem description and meets its requirements.
