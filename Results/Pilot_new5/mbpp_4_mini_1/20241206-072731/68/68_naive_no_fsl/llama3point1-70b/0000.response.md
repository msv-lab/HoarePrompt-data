Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to get the angle of a complex number. 

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` takes two inputs: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
- It constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex` function, which handles the inputs correctly.
- It then uses `cmath.phase()` to compute the phase angle of the complex number, which is the correct way to obtain the angle in radians.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs, including:
- Positive and negative real and imaginary parts.
- Cases where either the real or imaginary part is zero.
- Zero input (both real and imaginary parts are zero), which is a special case that returns an angle of zero.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
