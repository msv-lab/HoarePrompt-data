Functionality: ** The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these two components. There are no missing edge cases or errors present in the function as it correctly calculates the phase of the complex number regardless of the values of `real` and `imag`. **
