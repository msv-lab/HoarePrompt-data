Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number, which aligns with the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This matches the requirement to get the angle of a complex number.

2. **Complex Number Construction**: Inside the function, it constructs a complex number using the built-in `complex(real, imag)` function. This is the correct way to represent a complex number in Python.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to compute the phase (angle) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is specifically designed to return the angle in radians for a complex number, which meets the specifications of the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that test the function with specific complex numbers and checks if the computed angles are approximately equal to expected values using `math.isclose`. This is a good practice for verifying correctness through tests.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement and correctly calculates the angle of complex numbers for the tested cases, it fulfills its purpose. Thus, the program is correct.
