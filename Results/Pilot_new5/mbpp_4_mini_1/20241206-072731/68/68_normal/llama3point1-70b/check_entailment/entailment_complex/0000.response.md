Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are specified as floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. This aligns with the problem description that requires the function to handle complex numbers.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, a complex number is created using Python's built-in `complex(real, imag)` function. This accurately represents the complex number formed from the given real and imaginary parts.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The function then uses `cmath.phase(complex_num)` to compute the phase (or angle) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is specifically designed to return the angle of a complex number in radians, which directly fulfills the requirement to "get the angle of a complex number."

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated phase, thus providing the expected output as stated in the problem description.

5. **Comprehensive Handling**: The code correctly handles any valid floating-point input for `real` and `imag`, ensuring that it will compute the phase for a wide range of complex numbers.

Since the implementation adheres to the stated requirements and accurately computes the angle of a complex number from its real and imaginary parts, the program is correct.
