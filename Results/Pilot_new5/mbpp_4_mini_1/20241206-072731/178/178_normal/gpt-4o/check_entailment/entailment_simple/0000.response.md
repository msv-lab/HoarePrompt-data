Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements set by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers` using the `round()` function. This aligns with the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: After rounding the numbers, the function calculates the total sum of the rounded values using `sum(rounded_numbers)`. This aspect fulfills the requirement to compute the total sum of the rounded numbers.

3. **Multiplying by the Length of the List**: The function then multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list of numbers with the expression `total_sum * len(numbers)`. This correctly implements the requirement to multiply the total sum by the number of elements in the list.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the calculated result, which is what is expected according to the problem description.

The provided assertions test various cases and expect correct outputs, which indicates that the function is working as intended for those scenarios as well. Overall, the function adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the required logic.
