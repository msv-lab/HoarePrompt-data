The code creates a new list called `rounded_numbers`, which contains the rounded values of each element in the list `numbers`. The original values in `numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new list and retains the state of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of each element in `numbers`.**
