Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number using the `round()` function, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the original list.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Rounding**: The program rounds every number in the input list using the `round()` function. This is in accordance with the problem statement.

2. **Calculating the Sum**: After rounding the numbers, it computes the total sum of the rounded values, which is also required by the problem.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the sum of the rounded numbers is multiplied by the length of the input list, fulfilling the final requirement.

Considering edge cases:
- If the input list is empty, the program would return `0` as `len(numbers)` would be `0`, and the multiplication of the total sum (which is also `0` for an empty list) would yield the correct result.
- For lists containing negative numbers, the rounding and summing behavior remains appropriate, ensuring that the program handles negative values correctly.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the described requirements, I conclude that the program works correctly for all possible input scenarios.
