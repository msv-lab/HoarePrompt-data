Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both expected to be positive numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, the function does not include any error handling for cases where `radius` or `height` may not be positive, which could lead to potentially incorrect results if negative values are passed.**
