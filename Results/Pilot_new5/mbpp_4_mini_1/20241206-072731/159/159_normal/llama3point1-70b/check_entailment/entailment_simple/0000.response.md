Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the calculation of the volume of a cone as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the function `func_1` is accurate: it calculates the volume as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). 

The assumptions that the radius and height are positive numbers are also appropriate, as a cone cannot have negative dimensions. Therefore, the implementation adheres strictly to the requirements outlined in the problem description, ensuring that it will produce the correct result for valid positive inputs. 

In summary, the function fulfills the functionality required by the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
