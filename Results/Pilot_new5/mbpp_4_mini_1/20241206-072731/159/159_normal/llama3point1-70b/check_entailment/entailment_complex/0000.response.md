Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it lacks error handling for cases where the `radius` or `height` may not be positive. While the function is designed to calculate the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), it does not account for situations where either `radius` or `height` is less than or equal to zero. 

If negative values are provided, the function will still execute but return a negative or zero volume, which is not physically meaningful for the volume of a cone. The problem description explicitly states that `radius` and `height` must be positive numbers, and the function does not enforce this constraint.

Therefore, the absence of validation for the input values makes the program incorrect for all potential cases where invalid inputs may be given.
