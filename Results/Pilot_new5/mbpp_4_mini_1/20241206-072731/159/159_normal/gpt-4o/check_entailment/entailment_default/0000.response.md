The code provided defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function is called with various test assertions to check its correctness. 

Upon initial assessment, the function appears to implement the formula correctly for non-negative values of radius and height. However, the problem description does not mention how to handle negative or invalid inputs. 

The output hints clarify that the function does not handle negative or invalid inputs and explicitly states that it will return a valid volume only if both inputs are non-negative. This indicates a lack of input validation in the code, and the function would produce incorrect results (or potentially even incorrect behavior) if provided with invalid inputs, such as negative numbers.

Considering edge cases:
1. If `radius` is negative, `func_1(-5, 12)` will yield a negative volume, which is nonsensical in a physical context.
2. If `height` is negative, `func_1(5, -12)` will yield a negative volume as well.
3. If both `radius` and `height` are negative, `func_1(-5, -12)` will also yield a negative volume.

The function fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, particularly when it comes to handling negative values.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle negative input cases, which leads to incorrect outputs for those scenarios. The lack of input validation is a significant issue, as the function can produce invalid volumes that do not make sense in the context of the problem.
