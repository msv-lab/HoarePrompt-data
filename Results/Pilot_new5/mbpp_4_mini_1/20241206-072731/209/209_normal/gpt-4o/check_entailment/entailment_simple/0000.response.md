Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` which is assumed to contain multiple sublists, as stated in the problem description. The assertion that `lst` is a list of non-empty sublists is consistent with the function's operation.

2. **List Comprehension**: The core logic of the function uses a list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` to iterate over each sublist in `lst` and retrieve the first element (`sublist[0]`). This ensures that for each sublist, we effectively obtain its first element.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list that contains these first elements. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of the problem description, which asks for the first element of each sublist.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the cases given, confirming that the implementation meets the stated requirement.

Given that the function correctly identifies and returns the first elements of each sublist in accordance with the problem description, we conclude that the implementation is indeed correct.
