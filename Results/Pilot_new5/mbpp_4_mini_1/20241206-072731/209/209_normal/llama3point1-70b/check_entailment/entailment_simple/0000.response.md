Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists, referred to as `sublists`, where each sublist is guaranteed to contain at least one element. 

The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` within `sublists` and retrieves the first element (i.e., `sublist[0]`). The result is a new list that contains the first element of each sublist.

Since the problem description specifically asks for the first element of each sublist, and since each sublist is ensured to have at least one element (as stated in the annotations), the function will always return the correct output. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail, given the guaranteed conditions outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
