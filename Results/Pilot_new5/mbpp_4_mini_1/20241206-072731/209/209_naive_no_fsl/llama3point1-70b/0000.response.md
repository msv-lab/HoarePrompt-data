To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that extracts the first element from each sublist contained within a list of sublists.

### Analysis:
1. **Empty Sublists**: If a sublist is empty, attempting to access the first element (`sublist[0]`) will raise an `IndexError`. This edge case means that if any of the sublists does not contain elements, the function will fail.

2. **Single Sublists**: The function seems to handle sublists that are not empty correctly.

3. **Mixed Sublists**: The function does not account for the situation where some sublists are empty while others contain elements. 

### Edge Case:
- For input `sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the function raises an `IndexError` when it tries to access `sublist[0]` for the first empty list, which does not comply with the problem description.

Based on this analysis, the function does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case due to the inability to handle empty sublists.

Correctness: **False**
