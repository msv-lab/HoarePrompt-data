To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we start by analyzing the problem and the code:

**Problem description:** The function should take a tuple of numbers of length \( N+1 \) and return a tuple of length \( N \) where the \( i \)-th element is equal to \( t_i \times t_{i+1} \).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```

The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` and returns a new tuple comprising the products of adjacent elements in `t`. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function correctly iterates over the elements of the input tuple, multiplying each element with its adjacent element (i.e., \( t[i] \times t[i + 1] \)).
2. Given the range `len(t) - 1`, the function accounts for the fact that when \( t \) has a length of 1, the range would be 0, and thus, it correctly returns an empty tuple.

### Edge Cases:
- A tuple of length 1 (e.g., `(12,)`) correctly returns an empty tuple.
- A tuple of length 2 (e.g., `(1, 5)`) would correctly return `(5,)`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with length \( N+1 \) and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from `t`. If `t` has a length of 1, it will return an empty tuple. 

The output hints agree with the expectations set by the problem description and the implementation of the code.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to implement the required functionality correctly, handling both the regular cases and the edge case of a tuple of length 1. There are no evident flaws or missed edge cases based on the problem description and the given examples in the output hints.

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly computes the products of adjacent elements for any provided tuple of sufficient length, and it accurately returns an empty tuple for a tuple of length 1, aligning with the problem description.
