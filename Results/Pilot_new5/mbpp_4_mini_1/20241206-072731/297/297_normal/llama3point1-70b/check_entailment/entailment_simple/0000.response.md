Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers of length \( N+1 \) and returns a tuple of length \( N \). The \( i \)-th element of the returned tuple is calculated as the product of the \( i \)-th and \( (i+1) \)-th elements of the input tuple.

Here's how it works step by step:
1. The function `func_1` receives a tuple `numbers` with \( N+1 \) elements.
2. It uses the `zip` function to create pairs of adjacent elements from the tuple: \( (t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), \ldots, (t_N, t_{N+1}) \).
3. For each pair, it computes the product \( a * b \) (where \( a \) and \( b \) are the elements of each pair).
4. Finally, it constructs a tuple from these products.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3)`, the output will be `(1*2, 2*3)`, which results in `(2, 6)`. This matches the requirement where the \( i \)-th element of the result is the product of the \( i \)-th and \( (i+1) \)-th elements of the input.

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
