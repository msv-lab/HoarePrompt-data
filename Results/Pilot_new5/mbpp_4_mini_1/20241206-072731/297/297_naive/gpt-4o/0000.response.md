Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple has less than two elements correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length \( N \) where the \( i \)-th element is equal to \( t_i \times t_{i+1} \). However, if the input tuple has only one element, it will return an empty tuple instead of the expected behavior. The current implementation, when called with `func_1((12,))`, correctly returns `()` (an empty tuple), but this does not align with the expectation of producing a tuple of length \( N \) for valid inputs. 

For example, an input like `func_1((1, 2))` should return `(2,)` but if the input is a single element like `(1,)`, the program handles it incorrectly by returning `()` instead of producing a meaningful output based on the output requirements. Thus, the implementation does not meet the specifications given in the problem description.
