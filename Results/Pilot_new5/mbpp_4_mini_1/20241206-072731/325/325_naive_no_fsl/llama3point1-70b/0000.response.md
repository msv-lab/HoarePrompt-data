Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the following:

1. **Invalid Month Numbers**: The program does not check if the input month is within the valid range of 1 to 12. If an invalid month number (like 0 or 13) is provided, the function will return `False`, which is not the expected behavior since the problem does not specify what to do in such cases.

2. **Months with 31 Days**: The function only checks if a month has 30 days but does not return any information for months that have 31 days (such as January, March, May, July, August, October, December) or February, which has either 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year.

Given these points, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
