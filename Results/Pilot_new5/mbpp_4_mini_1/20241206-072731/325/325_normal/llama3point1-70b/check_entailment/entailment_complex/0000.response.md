Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While it correctly identifies the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November), it fails to consider the case of months that do not have 30 days.

According to the problem description, the function should check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. However, the function only returns `True` for the months with 30 days and `False` for all other months, including February which has 28 days. The requirement is to check if a month has 30 days, but the function does not explicitly state that it recognizes February (month 2) as having fewer than 30 days. Therefore, the function does not correctly fulfill the requirement to check whether the month number contains 30 days or not, as it does not explicitly handle or provide a correct response for all months, especially for February.

Thus, the program is incorrect since it does not address all months properly according to the problem description, particularly not indicating that February does not have 30 days.
