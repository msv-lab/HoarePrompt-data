Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the task is to check whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. 

The function `func_1` uses a set `{4, 6, 9, 11}` to determine if the month has 30 days. However, the function does not account for the fact that it should only handle valid month numbers between 1 and 12. The month of February (month 2) is incorrectly handled because it does not return `True` for months that have 30 days and doesn't handle invalid inputs.

Additionally, the assertion statements provided are incorrect given the problem description. For example:
- The assertion `assert func_1(6) == True` is correct since June has 30 days.
- The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is incorrect; February is not in the set, so the function will return `False`, which is correct, but the description asks if the month has 30 days, not whether it is in that specific set.
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is also incorrect since December has 31 days, and while it returns `False`, the structure of the problem is not fully represented.

Thus, the program is incomplete as it lacks validation for the input month being within the proper range and does not adequately consider all month lengths as required by the problem description.
