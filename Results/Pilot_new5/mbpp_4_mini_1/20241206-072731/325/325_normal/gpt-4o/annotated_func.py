#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns whether the integer 'month' between 1 and 12 is one of the months (April, June, September, November) that have 30 days, which are represented in 'months_with_30_days' as {4, 6, 9, 11}.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` between 1 and 12 and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional checks for invalid inputs, so if the input is outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will still return either `True` or `False` based solely on the membership of `month` in the defined set.
