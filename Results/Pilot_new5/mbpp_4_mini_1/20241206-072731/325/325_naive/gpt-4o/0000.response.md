Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case for February (month 2). According to the problem statement, February is not a month with 30 days, but the assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` implies that the function should return `False` for February, which is correct. However, the function does not account for months with 31 days, specifically it should also return `False` for months like January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) which have 31 days, but those cases are not explicitly tested in the assertions. 

Therefore, the function only checks if the month is in the set of months with 30 days but does not provide an explicit output for months with 31 days or February. 

For example, if we test `func_1(1)`, it would return `False` even though January has 31 days. Since the program does not fulfill the requirement of checking whether the month contains 30 days or not for all potential inputs, it is incorrect.
