To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

### Analyzing the Program:
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

1. **Understanding Even Natural Numbers:**
   The first `n` even natural numbers are:
   - For `n = 1`: 2
   - For `n = 2`: 2, 4
   - For `n = 3`: 2, 4, 6
   - For `n = 4`: 2, 4, 6, 8

2. **Calculating the Cube Sum:**
   - For `n = 2`: `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`
   - For `n = 3`: `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`
   - For `n = 4`: `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`

The assertions presented in the code are correct based on these calculations.

3. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - What if `n` is 0? The function does not handle this case, as it will return the sum of an empty list, which is `0`. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle `n = 0`, making this a potential edge case.
   - If `n` is negative, our function currently does not address this, and it should ideally raise an error or return a specific output.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not define behavior for `n = 0` or negative values, we conclude that there are indeed potential cases where the program does not behave according to the problem description.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
