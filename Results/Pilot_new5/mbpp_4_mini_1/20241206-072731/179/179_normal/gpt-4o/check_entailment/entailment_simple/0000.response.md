To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we analyze the annotated program and see if it fulfills the requirement of calculating the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

### Problem Description
The function must calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
```

### Analysis
1. **Even Numbers Generation**:
   - The program generates the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
   - For `n = 1`, it generates [2].
   - For `n = 2`, it generates [2, 4].
   - For `n = 3`, it generates [2, 4, 6].
   - This is correct as it generates the sequence of even natural numbers.

2. **Calculating the Cube Sum**:
   - The program calculates the cube of each even number and sums them: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
   - This operation is also correct as it accurately computes the sum of cubes of the generated even numbers.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The program returns the computed `cube_sum`, which reflects the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

### Correctness of `func_1`
- For `n = 2`:
  - The even numbers are [2, 4].
  - Their cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`:
  - The even numbers are [2, 4, 6].
  - Their cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `n = 4`:
  - The even numbers are [2, 4, 6, 8].
  - Their cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

Since the results of the function calls in the assertions match the expected results based on the problem description, we conclude that the program meets the requirements set forth.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Correctness: **True**
