Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task of finding the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Even Numbers Generation**: The function `func_1(n)` generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This generates the list `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2n]`, which correctly represents the first `n` even natural numbers.

2. **Cube Calculation**: The program calculates the cube of each of these even numbers using the expression `x ** 3 for x in even_numbers` within the `sum` function. This ensures that each even number is cubed before summing.

3. **Sum of Cubes**: The final sum of the cubes is computed correctly and returned as `cube_sum`.

4. **Validation**: The assertions provided (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 72`) check that the function is returning the correct values for specific inputs, confirming that the implementation is functioning as intended.

5. **Mathematical Accuracy**: The comment correctly states that the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers can be represented by the formula \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\), which aligns with how the program processes the numbers.

Since all steps in the function lead to the correct calculation of the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, the program is both correct and complete according to the problem description.
