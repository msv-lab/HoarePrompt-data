`num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. Since `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, its length corresponds to the number of digits in `n`. As `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_len` will be a non-negative integer as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` (equal to the number of digits in `n`).**
