Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is an Armstrong number, returning True if it is and False otherwise. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function does not handle any input validation, so passing negative integers or non-integer types would lead to unexpected behavior or errors. **
