Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, which aligns with the problem description stating that the input should be a number.

2. **Armstrong Number Logic**: The function converts the number to its string representation and calculates the length of this string, which represents the number of digits in the original number. For each digit in this string, it raises the digit to the power of the total number of digits (length of the string) and sums these values.

3. **Comparison**: Finally, the function compares this computed sum to the original number `num`. If they are equal, it indicates that `num` is an Armstrong number and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

4. **Correctness of the Check**: An Armstrong number, by definition, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The implementation accurately reflects this definition.

The program will correctly identify Armstrong numbers for all valid non-negative integer inputs and follows the logic as described in the problem. Thus, it adheres to the problem's requirements and is deemed correct.
