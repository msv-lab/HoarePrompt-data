According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `num_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `num`. For the loop to be executed, `num_str` must have at least one character (i.e., `num` must be a non-negative integer that is not zero). 

At the start of the loop, the `digit` variable will take on the value of each character in `num_str`, one by one. Given that `num_str` is derived from `num`, if `num` is 0, then `num_str` will be `"0"`, which would allow the loop to execute once. 

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, we need the `num` to be a non-negative integer (which it is), and we need to specify that `num_str` can be either the empty string (if num is 0) or contain characters if `num` is a non-zero integer. We also need to set `digit` to the first character of `num_str` when the loop starts. 

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character of `num_str`**
