The value of `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. The variable `num_len` is equal to itself, which means it does not change. The hypothetical `digit` is the next character at an index equal to `num_len`, but since it is not present in `num_str`, we do not have an actual value for `digit`. Thus, we cannot determine a specific numeric value for `sum` after the operation, but we know that it has been modified by the expression `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to `num_len`, `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to its previous value.**
