According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of the number `num_str`. The loop will iterate over each character (digit) in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has been processed up to the last character. Since `num_len` represents the length of `num_str`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, and `num_len` is the length of `num_str`. Thus, if `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, the loop will have executed `num_len` times (for indices 0 to `num_len - 1`). To execute one more time, the index would need to be equal to `num_len`, indicating that there are no more characters left in `num_str`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_str` must remain unchanged, `num_len` must still represent its length, and we can indicate that we would be processing the next hypothetical character (even though there are none).

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to `num_len`, `sum` is equal to `int(digit)` where `digit` would be the hypothetical next character at index equal to `num_len` (not present in `num_str`).**
