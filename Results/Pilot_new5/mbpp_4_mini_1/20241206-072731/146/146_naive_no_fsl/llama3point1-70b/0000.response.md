Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input `list_of_lists` is empty. If the input is an empty list, `max()` will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot determine the maximum length of sublists when there are none. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
