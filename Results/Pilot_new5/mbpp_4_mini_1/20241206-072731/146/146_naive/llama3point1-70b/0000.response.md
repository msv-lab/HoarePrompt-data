To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program:

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Analysis:
1. The function starts by calculating `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`.
2. It then creates `max_sublists`, which contains all sublists that have a length equal to `max_len`.
3. Finally, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Empty List of Lists**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, calling `max()` on it will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to evaluate.
- **Multiple Sublists of Maximum Length**: While the function does find all sublists of maximum length, it only returns the first one. The problem statement does not specify that we need to return only one sublist, so this behavior could be considered incomplete if the specification was intended to return all maximum-length sublists.

### Conclusion:
The program will fail if given an empty list, as it does not handle this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
