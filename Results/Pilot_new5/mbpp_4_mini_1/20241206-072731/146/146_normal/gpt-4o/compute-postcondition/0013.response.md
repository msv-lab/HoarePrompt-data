The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is one of the sublists contained in `list_of_lists`. Since `max_len` is the length of the specific sublist referred to as `lst`, it implies that `lst` is one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
