In the provided code snippet, `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`. However, the variable `lst` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it refers to one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least 3 sublists, `len(lst)` will evaluate to the length of that specific sublist assigned to `lst`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists, `max_len` is the length of the specific sublist referred to as `lst`.**
