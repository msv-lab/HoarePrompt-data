To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's break down the task.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the longest sublist from a list of lists and return both the length of this longest sublist and the sublist itself. If the input list is empty, it should return 0 and an empty list.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
3. If the length of the current sublist `lst` is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

This approach logically follows the requirement of finding the longest sublist. However, we need to consider edge cases.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If `list_of_lists` is empty (i.e., `[]`), the function should return (0, []). The current implementation does not have explicit handling for this case. Thus, it would return (0, []), which is correct, but it lacks clarity in the implementation regarding this edge case.
- If there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length, the function only returns the first one it encounters, which is correct based on the description as it doesn't say how to handle ties.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list of sublists and returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself.
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.
- The function effectively finds the longest sublist by comparing lengths and correctly handles the empty input case.

### Agreement with the Code:
The output hints agree with the function's implementation. The function does return (0, []) for an empty list and compares lengths correctly for non-empty lists. 

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the implementation against the problem description and the provided output hints, the function works correctly for all described cases and edge cases. It effectively handles the empty list case and properly identifies the longest sublist.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly implements the requirements as specified in the problem description.
