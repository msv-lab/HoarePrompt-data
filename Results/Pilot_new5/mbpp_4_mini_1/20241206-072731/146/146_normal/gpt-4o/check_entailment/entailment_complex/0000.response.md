Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list containing sublists. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Finding Maximum Length**: The program initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. It iterates through each sublist `lst` within `list_of_lists`, checking the length of each sublist using `len(lst)`. If a sublist is longer than the current `max_len`, it updates both `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly. This logic effectively ensures that the function identifies the longest sublist.

3. **Return Values**: After the loop, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` (the length of the longest sublist) and `max_list` (the longest sublist itself). This is exactly what the problem description requiresâ€”returning both the length of the longest sublist and the sublist itself.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function will return the initial values of `max_len` (0) and `max_list` (an empty list), which is the expected behavior as specified in the problem description.

5. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code test specific cases and expect correct outputs, which the function produces correctly according to the logic implemented.

Overall, the function meets all criteria outlined in the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, confirming its correctness.
