Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has fewer than two elements correctly. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. If the array has fewer than two elements, it is impossible to find a difference between two elements, and the function should raise an error or return an indication of that (such as `None` or another meaningful value), instead of returning `0`. 

For example:
- If the input is `func_1((1,), 1)` (an array with only one element), the program will incorrectly return `0`, which does not reflect the problem's requirements.
