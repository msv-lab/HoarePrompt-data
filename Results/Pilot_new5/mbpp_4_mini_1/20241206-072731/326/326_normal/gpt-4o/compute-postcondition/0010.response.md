According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should increase by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which implies that after increasing `i`, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
