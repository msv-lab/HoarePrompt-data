The `arr` variable is assigned a sorted version of itself, meaning the integers in `arr` will now be in ascending order. The length of `arr`, which is `n`, remains unchanged as the sorting operation does not affect the number of elements in the list. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` and is greater than or equal to 2.**
