Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, while `i` remains 1 and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.***
