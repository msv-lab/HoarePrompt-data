The value of `diff` is assigned the result of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `i` is currently 1, `diff` becomes equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The values of `arr`, `n`, `min_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]**.
