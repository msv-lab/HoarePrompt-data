According to the code, the loop iterates `n - 1` times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and is at least 2, the value of `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `min_diff` is initialized to positive infinity. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration.

For the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `i` starts from 0 and `n` can be used to determine the number of iterations. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
