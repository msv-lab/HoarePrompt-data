You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since n is a positive integer less than 2, indicating that the length of 'arr' is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is equal to the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, and `i` is `n - 2` after all iterations.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is equal to the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` representing the length of the list. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
