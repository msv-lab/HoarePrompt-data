#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. If `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr', which is stored in 'min_diff'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function does not handle this case and will return positive infinity as `min_diff`, which is not meaningful in the context of finding a difference. Therefore, it assumes that the input list will always have at least two elements.
