Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks the length of the array (`n`). If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0, which is appropriate since a minimum difference cannot be calculated with fewer than two elements.

2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which is necessary to compare adjacent elements for finding the minimum difference.

3. **Calculating Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array and computes the difference between consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided are all correctly implemented. 
   - For the first assertion, `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)` sorted is `(1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25)`, and the minimum difference is `1` (between 18 and 19).
   - For the second, `(4, 3, 2, 6)` sorted is `(2, 3, 4, 6)`, and the minimum difference is `1` (between 2 and 3).
   - For the third, `(30, 5, 20, 9)` sorted is `(5, 9, 20, 30)`, and the minimum difference is `4` (between 5 and 9).

All edge cases and the provided test cases indicate that the function adheres to the problem's requirements properly. Thus, the code is correct.
