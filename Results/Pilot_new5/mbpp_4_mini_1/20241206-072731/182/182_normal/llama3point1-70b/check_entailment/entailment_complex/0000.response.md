Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. While the function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple, it fails to handle the case of an empty string. According to the annotations, if there is any empty string in the tuple, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access the last character of that string. 

The problem description requires the function to extract the last character from each string, but it does not specify what should happen in the case of empty strings. Therefore, the presence of an empty string leads to an error, making the program incorrect for cases where the input tuple contains empty strings. This means it does not reliably perform the task as described for all possible inputs.
