Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) that contains strings, which aligns with the requirement to extract elements from a tuple.
2. **Extracting the Rear Index Element**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple and accesses the last character using `s[-1]`. This directly corresponds to the task of extracting the last (or rear index) element from each string.
3. **Return Type**: The function returns a list of characters, which matches the expected output format.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that confirm the function's correctness for different input cases. They show that the function consistently extracts the last character from each string in the tuple, validating the implementation against the problem description.

Since the program meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
