The provided program aims to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. Here's the analysis:

The function `func_1(tup)` processes the input tuple and constructs a list containing the last character from each string using a list comprehension. The expected behavior for the function based on the problem description is correct for non-empty strings, as demonstrated in the assertions.

However, the potential edge case arises when any string in the tuple is empty. In this scenario, accessing `s[-1]` will result in an `IndexError` since there is no last character to access. The output hints clearly state that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

Thus, since the program does not handle the case of empty strings and would throw an error, it does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

The program fails when given an input like `func_1(('', 'test'))`, leading to an IndexError. This edge case shows that the program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.
