Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly extracts the last character from each string in the given tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string (`s`) in the input `strings` and retrieves the last character (`s[-1]`). 

This implementation will work correctly for various cases, including:

1. Strings of different lengths (including single character strings).
2. An empty string, where the behavior of accessing the last index will not occur since there would be no strings to process.
3. A tuple containing strings of various characters (including special characters).

The only edge case to consider is if the input tuple consists of an empty string, e.g., `("",)`, the program will correctly return `['']`, which is the last element of that empty string.

Since I cannot find any example where the program does not perform as expected based on the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
