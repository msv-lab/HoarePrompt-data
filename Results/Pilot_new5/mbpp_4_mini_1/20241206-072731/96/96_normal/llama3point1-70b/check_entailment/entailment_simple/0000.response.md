Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses a set comprehension to collect the types of each element in the tuple. It then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Type**: The function is designed to work with a tuple, which is the expected input based on the problem description.
  
2. **Type Checking**: The use of `type(x) for x in tup` effectively retrieves the data type of each element in the tuple. 

3. **Uniqueness Check**: By converting the list of types to a set, the function ensures that it only contains unique types. If all elements are of the same type, the set will contain exactly one element.

4. **Return Value**: The final comparison `len(set(...)) == 1` returns `True` if all elements are of the same type, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. If there are different types, the length of the set will be greater than one, and the function will return `False`.

Thus, the program effectively fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring correctness.
