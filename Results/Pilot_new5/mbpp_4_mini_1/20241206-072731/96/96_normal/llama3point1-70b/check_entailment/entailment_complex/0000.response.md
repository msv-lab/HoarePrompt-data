Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it effectively fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1(tup)` checks if all elements in the provided tuple `tup` are of the same data type. Here's how it works:

1. **Type Extraction**: The expression `set(type(x) for x in tup)` creates a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. Since sets automatically handle duplicates, the set will contain only unique types.

2. **Comparison**: The condition `len(set(...)) == 1` checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, this means that all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. If the length is greater than 1, it indicates that there are multiple data types present.

3. **Correct Edge Case Handling**: The function does not specifically check for an empty tuple, but in Python, an empty tuple will return an empty set, and the length of that set will be 0. According to the provided logic, this correctly leads to the conclusion that there are no differing types, and the function returns `True`.

Overall, the function behaves correctly as per the problem description by returning `True` when all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Thus, it is valid in all described cases, including edge scenarios like an empty tuple.
