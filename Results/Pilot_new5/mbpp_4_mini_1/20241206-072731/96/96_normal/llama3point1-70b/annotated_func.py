#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in the tuple 'tup' are of the same data type, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle edge cases such as an empty tuple, but since an empty tuple would also imply that there are no differing types, it correctly returns True in that case.
