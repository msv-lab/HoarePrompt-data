According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. Since `tup` is confirmed to be non-empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `element` will be set to the last element of the tuple, and we need to ensure we capture the type of that last element as well.

For the loop to be executed:
- `tup` must be a non-empty tuple (which it already is).
- `element` will take the value of the first element in `tup` in the first iteration, and it will sequentially take each subsequent element in each iteration.

Therefore, before the loop starts:
- The variable `element` is initialized to the first element of `tup`. 

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the first element of `tup`**
