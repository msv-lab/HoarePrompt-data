Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. 

1. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, which is reasonable since there are no elements to compare.
2. It initializes `first_type` with the type of the first element and iterates over all elements in the tuple.
3. For each element, it checks if its type matches `first_type`. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
4. If all elements are of the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions confirm the behavior of the function:
- `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)` contains all integers, hence returns `True`.
- `(1, 2, '4')` contains integers and a string, hence returns `False`.
- `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)` contains all integers, hence returns `True`.

The function handles the cases described correctly, and I cannot find any potential case where it fails to meet the requirements. Thus, the function is correct for the given problem description.
