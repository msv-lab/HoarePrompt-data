Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does this by calculating the maximum element using `max(arr)` and the minimum element using `min(arr)`, and then returns their difference. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases:
1. If the array has only one element, the maximum and minimum will be the same, resulting in a difference of 0.
2. If the array is empty, calling `max()` and `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, but the problem description does not specify how to handle empty arrays. Therefore, while the code may raise an error in this case, it does not contradict the correctness of the logic itself for non-empty arrays.
3. It correctly handles negative numbers and positive numbers.

Overall, the logic for finding the maximum difference is sound, and I cannot identify any input cases where it does not fulfill the requirement as per the problem description.
