Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the array. The difference between these two values gives the maximum difference. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for multiple test cases:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

The function correctly handles sequences of any length and returns the expected maximum difference. There are no edge cases involving an empty input or inputs with one element since those cases aren't tested in the assertions, but the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases either. Thus, given the provided requirements and test cases, the program is correct.
