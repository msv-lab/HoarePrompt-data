To assess the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function that finds the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a **sorted array**.

### Program
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Initialization**: The variables `low`, `high`, and `result` are initialized correctly for binary search. `result` is initialized to -1, which will be returned if the target is not found.
  
2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - If the middle element (`arr[mid]`) equals the target, `result` is updated to `mid`, and `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1` to search for the first occurrence to the left.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop, the function returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence of the target, or -1 if the target is not present in the array.

### Edge Cases Consideration
- The function should correctly handle an empty list by returning -1, which is indeed specified.
- It should also correctly find the first occurrence of the target even when multiple instances are present.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function correctly processes:
- A sorted list of integers.
- Returns the index of the first occurrence if the target exists in the list.
- Returns -1 if the target does not exist.
- It specifically mentions that it handles the edge case of an empty list.

### Verification Against Output Hints
The hints specify that `func_1` correctly performs a binary search and handles edge cases. Since the code appears to correctly implement the binary search logic, including searching for the first occurrence by adjusting `high`, this aligns with the output hints.

### Conclusion
After verifying the logic of the code and the output hints, it seems that the program correctly meets the problem description. There does not appear to be any case in which the program fails to correctly identify the index of the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array.

Correctness: **True**.
