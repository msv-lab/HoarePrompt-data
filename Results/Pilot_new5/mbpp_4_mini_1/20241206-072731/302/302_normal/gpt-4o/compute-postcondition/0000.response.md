The values of `low` and `high` are being assigned. `low` is set to `0`, and `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, which calculates the index of the last element in the sorted list `arr`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`**
