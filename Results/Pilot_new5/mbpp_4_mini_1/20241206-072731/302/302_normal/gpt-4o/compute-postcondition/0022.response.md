According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `arr` has at least one element, and thus `high` must be at least 0 if we are looking for an element in a non-empty array.

Since the loop condition is `low <= high`, for the loop to execute one more time, it is essential that `low` remains less than or equal to `high` after the last iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `low` is not greater than `high`.

Given that `arr[mid]` is equal to `target` in one case, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. This means `high` has potentially changed and could become less than `low`. For this loop to execute again, we must ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. 

If `low` is already equal to or less than `high`, and if `high` is being reduced, we may need to adjust `low` to ensure that it stays within bounds for another iteration.

Since we don't have exact values for `low` and `high`, we can express the requirement that `low` must remain less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`arr` has at least one element, `target` is an integer, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
