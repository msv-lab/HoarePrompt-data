The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` exists, it returns its index; if not, it returns -1. The function correctly handles edge cases, including an empty list where it will return -1 since `target` cannot be found in an empty array.
