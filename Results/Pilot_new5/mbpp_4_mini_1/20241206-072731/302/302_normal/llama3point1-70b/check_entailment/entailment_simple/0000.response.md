Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`.
2. **Iteration**: The program uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the elements of the array, allowing it to keep track of both the index and the value of each element.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `x` matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index `i` of that element.
4. **Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding the number, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `num` is not present in the array.
5. **Sorted Array**: Although the loop checks each element linearly, the problem does not specify that the search must be optimized for the sorted nature of the array. The function still fulfills the requirement of finding the first occurrence of `num`.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the specified functionality of finding the index of the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array and handles the case where the number is not present by returning `-1`. Therefore, it satisfies the problem description.
