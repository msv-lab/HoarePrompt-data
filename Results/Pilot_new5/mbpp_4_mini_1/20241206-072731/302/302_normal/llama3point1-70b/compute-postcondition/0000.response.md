According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. The loop will iterate over the elements of `arr` if it contains at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the index of the first element), and `x` should be set to the first element in the list. 

For the loop to be executed, `arr` must be a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `i` should start at 0, while `x` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
