Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input list `numbers` is empty. If the input is an empty list, the division by `len(numbers)` will result in a division by zero error. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, it will attempt to divide `product` (which is 1) by 0 (the length of the empty list), leading to a runtime error. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
