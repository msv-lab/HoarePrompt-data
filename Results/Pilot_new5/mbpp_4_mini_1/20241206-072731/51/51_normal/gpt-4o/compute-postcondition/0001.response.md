According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the list is stated to be not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `product` is 1 and `num` will be the last number in the list. For the loop to be executed, the `numbers` list should have at least 1 number, `num` will be the first number in the list during the first iteration, and `product` remains 1 at the start.

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list**
