`product` is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. Initially, `product` is 1, and `num` is the first element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, after the execution, `product` will be equal to the first element of `numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 1 element, `product` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the first element in the list `numbers`.**
