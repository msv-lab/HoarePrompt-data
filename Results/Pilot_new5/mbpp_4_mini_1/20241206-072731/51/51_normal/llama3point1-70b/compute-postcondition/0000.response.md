The code assigns the value of `1` to the variable `product`. This does not affect the state of the list `numbers`, which remains unchanged. The value of `product` is now explicitly `1`, overriding any previous value it may have had (if it existed). Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping the original state of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element; `product` is 1**
