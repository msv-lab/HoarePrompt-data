The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (which can include integers and floats) and calculates the product of all elements in that list. After calculating the product, it divides this product by the number of elements in the list, effectively returning the average if all elements are multiplied together. 

However, the implementation does not handle the edge case where the list contains zero values, as multiplying by zero would result in a product of zero, leading to a return value of zero regardless of the number of elements in the list. Additionally, if the list is empty (though the precondition states there is at least one element), a division by zero error would occur. Since the precondition is stated as at least one element, the function does not account for invalid inputs of an empty list or lists containing only zero values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the product of the numbers divided by the length of the list. If the list contains a zero, the function will return zero. It assumes that the list contains at least one element, and does not handle cases of empty lists or lists with only zero elements gracefully. **
