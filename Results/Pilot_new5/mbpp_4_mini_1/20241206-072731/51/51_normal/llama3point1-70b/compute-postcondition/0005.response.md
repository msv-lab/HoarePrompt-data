According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, and `product` is equal to the square of that second element. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `num` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `product` is equal to the square of the third element of `numbers`, `num` is the third element in the list**.
