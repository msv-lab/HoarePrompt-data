The value of `product` is multiplied by `num`, where `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`. The initial value of `product` is equal to the square of `num`, so multiplying `product` by `num` results in `product` being equal to `num` cubed (`num**3`). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `product` is equal to `num` cubed, `num` is the third element in the list**.
