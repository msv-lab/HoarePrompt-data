Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here's the explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes in a list called `numbers`, which meets the condition of having at least one element.

2. **Product Calculation**: The program initializes a variable `product` to 1 and iterates through each number in the list, multiplying these numbers together. This is done using a for loop, where `product *= num` successively accumulates the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product, the function divides the product by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`), which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

4. **Output**: The function returns the result of `product / len(numbers)`, which is the total product of the numbers divided by the count of those numbers in the list.

Since this matches exactly with the task outlined in the problem description—multiplying all numbers in the list and dividing by the length—there are no discrepancies. The program works under the assumption that the list contains at least one element, preventing any division by zero errors. 

Thus, the implementation is correct in every potential case given the constraints, fulfilling the requirements set forth in the problem description.
