#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least one element, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `num` is the last element in the list `numbers`.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the value of product divided by the length of the list 'numbers', where product is equal to the product of all elements in the list and len(numbers) is the count of elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the product of the numbers divided by the length of the list. If the list contains a zero, the function will return zero. It assumes that the list contains at least one element, and does not handle cases of empty lists or lists with only zero elements gracefully.
