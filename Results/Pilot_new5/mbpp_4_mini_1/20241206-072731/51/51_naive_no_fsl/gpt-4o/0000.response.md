To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list (or tuple) and then divides the result by the length of that list.

### Program Implementation:
The function `func_1(numbers)` multiplies all the numbers in the input iterable (`numbers`) and divides the resulting product by the length of that iterable.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7))` should return `-67.2`
2. `func_1((-10, -20, -30))` should return `-2000.0`
3. `func_1((19, 15, 18))` should return `1710.0`

### Key Aspects to Verify:
1. **Empty Input**: What happens if the input is an empty iterable? The program will attempt to divide by zero when calculating `result = product / len(numbers)` which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
2. **Single Element Input**: The program should handle a single element properly, which it does, as it will just return the element itself since `product` will be the single element and dividing by 1 will yield the element.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the edge case of an empty input. Hence, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
