To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(n)` in detail.

### Problem Description
The task is to check whether a given number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as one which alternates between two different digits, meaning:
1. It must have at least three digits.
2. Its first two digits must be different.
3. The digits at even indices (0-based) must match the first digit, and the digits at odd indices must match the second digit.

### Analyzing the Code
- The function first checks if the length of the number `n` (converted to a string `s`) is less than 3. If yes, it returns `False`. This is correct.
- It then checks if the first two digits are equal. If they are, it returns `False`. This is also correct.
- In the loop, it checks each digit based on whether it is at an even or odd index:
  - If at an even index, it should match the first digit.
  - If at an odd index, it should match the second digit.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Single-digit numbers** like `1` or `9` (len < 3): should return `False`.
2. **Two-digit numbers** like `11` or `22` (len < 3): should return `False`.
3. **Valid undulating numbers** such as `121` or `343`: should return `True`.
4. **Invalid undulating numbers** such as `1212`, since it repeats the first digit in the second position: should return `False`.
5. **Non-undulating numbers** like `123` or `2020`: should return `False`.

### Additional Test Cases
Letâ€™s consider the number `12321`. 
- The length is valid (5), the first two digits are different (1 and 2), but it does not alternate correctly. The expected output should be `False`, as it doesn't follow the undulating pattern (it has more than two distinct digits).

### Conclusion
The function does not handle the case where there are more than two distinct digits correctly; it incorrectly allows numbers like `12321` to return `True` if they pass the initial checks.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
