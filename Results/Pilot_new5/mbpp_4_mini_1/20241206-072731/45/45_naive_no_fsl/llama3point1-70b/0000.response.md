To determine if the provided code correctly checks whether a given number is "undulating" as per the problem description, we need to first clarify what "undulating" means. 

Typically, an undulating number means that the digits of the number alternate between increasing and decreasing. For example, numbers like `121`, `232`, or `545` are undulating, but `122` or `123` are not.

### Analyzing the Program:
Let's take a closer look at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Logic Flow:
- The function converts the number to a string and initializes a flag `undulating` to `True`.
- It then iterates through the digits of the number from the second digit to the second-to-last digit.
- Within the loop, it checks if either of the following conditions hold:
  - The current digit is greater than the previous and less than the next.
  - The current digit is less than the previous and greater than the next.
  
If neither condition is satisfied, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks the loop.

### Evaluating Edge Cases:
1. **Single Digit Numbers**: The function will return `True` because there are no adjacent digits to compare.
2. **Two Digit Numbers**: The function will return `True` since it does not check these cases and simply evaluates the loop.
3. **Undulating Cases**: For cases like `121` or `232`, it will return `True` as expected.
4. **Non-Undulating Cases**: For cases like `123` or `122`, it will return `False` as expected.

### Problematic Case:
However, the code does not handle the case where multiple identical digits appear consecutively. For example:
- For the input `1221`, the function will return `True`, which is incorrect, because `1221` is not an undulating number.

### Conclusion:
Given this example where the function does not return the correct result for the input `1221`, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
