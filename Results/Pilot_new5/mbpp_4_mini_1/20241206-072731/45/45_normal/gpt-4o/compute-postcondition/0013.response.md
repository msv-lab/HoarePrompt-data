Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, `i` is even, the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to `first_digit`, and the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false and `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit` (which is not equal to `second_digit`).***
