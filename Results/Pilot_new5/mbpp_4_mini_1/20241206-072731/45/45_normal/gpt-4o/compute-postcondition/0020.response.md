Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 4, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is 3 and `i % 2` is equal to 1 (which it is), and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. In all other cases where `s[i]` equals `second_digit`, or `i % 2` is not equal to 1, there is no return value (None).***
