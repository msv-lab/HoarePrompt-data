According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(n) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100". Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Since `n` is a string representing a number that is at least "100", the length of `n` will be at least 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need `i` to be less than `len(n) - 1`, which is satisfied since `i` will be 2 and `len(n)` will be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100", `i` is 2**
