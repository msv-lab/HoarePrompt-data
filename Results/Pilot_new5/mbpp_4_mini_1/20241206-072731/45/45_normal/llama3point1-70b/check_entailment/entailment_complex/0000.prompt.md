You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100", `undulating` is True if all digits in `n` form an undulating pattern, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #The program returns undulating, which is True if all digits in the positive integer string 'n' form an undulating pattern, otherwise it is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating pattern (i.e., each digit either increases and then decreases or decreases and then increases). It returns True if the digits form such a pattern, and False otherwise. The function assumes that `n` is at least 100, as it relies on the length of the string representation of `n`. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 100, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
