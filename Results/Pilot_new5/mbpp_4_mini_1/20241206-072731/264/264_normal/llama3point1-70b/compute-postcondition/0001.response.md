The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, it returns `deg` multiplied by Ï€ and divided by 180, effectively converting the angle from degrees to radians. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and return its equivalent in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg, representing an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians.**
