The provided program is intended to convert degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees × (π / 180). Looking at the code, it seems to implement this formula correctly.

However, we must also consider edge cases and evaluate whether the function handles all possible input scenarios. The problem description does not state that the input must be a valid numeric type, and the program does not have any error handling for invalid input types (e.g., strings, None, or other non-numeric types). 

Now, let's check the output hints: they clarify that the function accepts a numeric parameter `degrees` and returns the angle in radians by converting degrees using the specified formula, but it explicitly states that it does not handle errors related to invalid input types or values, which aligns with the observed code.

Considering an edge case, if we were to input a string (e.g., `func_1("90")`), the program would raise a TypeError because strings cannot be multiplied by a float. This indicates that the function is not robust and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

This conclusion is based on the fact that the function does not handle any invalid input types, which could lead to runtime errors, thus failing to meet the expectations laid out in the problem description.
