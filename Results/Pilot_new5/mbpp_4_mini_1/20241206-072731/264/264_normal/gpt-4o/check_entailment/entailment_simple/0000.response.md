Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input in degrees and applies the conversion formula, which is `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This formula is accurate for converting angles from degrees to radians, since there are π radians in 180 degrees. 

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests to validate the correctness of the function for specific degree values (90, 60, and 120), and the expected outcomes match the results of the conversion:

- For 90 degrees, the conversion yields π/2, which is approximately 1.5707963267948966.
- For 60 degrees, the conversion yields π/3, which is approximately 1.0471975511965976.
- For 120 degrees, the conversion yields 2π/3, which is approximately 2.0943951023931953.

Since the function behaves correctly for the tested values, and the conversion formula applied is mathematically sound for any numeric input representing degrees, the program meets the problem requirements. Thus, it correctly fulfills the task of converting degrees to radians for all potential cases.
