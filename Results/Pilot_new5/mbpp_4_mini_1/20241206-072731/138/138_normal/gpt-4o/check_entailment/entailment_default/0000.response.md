Let's analyze the provided program and problem description carefully.

**Problem description:** The function should take an array and an element, returning a tuple that indicates whether the element is in the array and the index of that element or -1 if it is not found.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

The function iterates through each element of the array `arr` using `enumerate`, checking if the current element `value` is equal to `element`. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the found element. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

**Initial assessment:**
1. The core logic of the program seems to align with the problem description. It checks for the presence of an element and correctly returns its index if found.
2. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and -1, which also meets the requirements.

**Edge cases to consider:**
1. What if the array is empty? The function should return `(False, -1)`, which it does.
2. What if the element is not in the array? Again, it returns `(False, -1)`.
3. What if the element appears multiple times in the array? The function returns the index of the first occurrence, which adheres to the description.

Next, let's examine the **Output hints:** 
"The function accepts a list `arr` and an element of any data type. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence; if not found, it returns `False` and -1. This means the function has a straightforward mechanism for indicating the presence or absence of an element and its position, covering all potential cases without any missing logic."

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function handles all described cases correctly without any missing logic.

**Final verdict:**
Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints validate the correctness of the logic without presenting any edge cases where the function would fail, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies the presence of an element in the array and returns the appropriate index or -1, ensuring all potential cases are handled.
