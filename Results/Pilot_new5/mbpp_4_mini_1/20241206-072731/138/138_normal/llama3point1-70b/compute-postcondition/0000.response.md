The line of code `index = array.index(element)` assigns the value of the index of `element` in the `array` to the variable `index`. The state of `array` remains unchanged, and `element` must exist within the `array` for this operation to succeed without error. The output state will reflect the updated variable.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is in `array`, `index` is the index of `element` in `array`.**
