The program could raise a `ValueError` if the specified `element` is not found in the `array`. If the `element` is present, the program retrieves the index of that `element` in the `array` and returns `True` along with the index. If the `element` is absent, the `ValueError` is caught, and the program returns `False` and -1. 

Therefore, the output state is: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1. 

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1.**
