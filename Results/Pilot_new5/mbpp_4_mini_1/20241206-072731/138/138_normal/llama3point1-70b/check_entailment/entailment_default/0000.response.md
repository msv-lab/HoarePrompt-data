To assess the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze them carefully.

**Problem description:** The function is supposed to take in an array and an element, returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list `array` and an arbitrary `element`. It returns `True` and the index of `element` if it is found in `array`. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. The function handles the case where the element is not present by catching a `ValueError` exception.

### Initial Assessment
1. The function uses the `index` method of lists, which properly returns the index of the element if it exists. If the element is not present, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught in the `except` block.
2. The output structure matches the requirement of returning a tuple with a boolean and the index or -1.

### Edge Cases
Considering edge cases:
- If the input array is empty, the function should return `(False, -1)`. The current implementation correctly handles this case since `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError`.
- If the element is not found in the array, the function should also return `(False, -1)`, which is handled correctly by the `try` and `except` blocks.
- If the element is found, the index is correctly returned.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for both present and absent cases of the element in the array. The hint about catching the `ValueError` aligns with the function's implementation and confirms that it correctly handles cases where the element is not in the array.

### Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the function meets the problem requirements for all potential cases described. There are no identified edge cases or examples where the function fails to perform as specified.

Correctness: **True**.
