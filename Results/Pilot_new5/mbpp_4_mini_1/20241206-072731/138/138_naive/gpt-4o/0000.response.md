Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element, then checks if the element is present in the array. If it is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If not, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the tested cases, and there are no edge cases or potential inputs in the problem description that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description.
