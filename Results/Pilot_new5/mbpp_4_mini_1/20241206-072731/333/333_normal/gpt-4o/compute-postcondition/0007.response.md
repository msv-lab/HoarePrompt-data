Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is not a value from the `matching_pairs` dictionary, and `char` is a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary. At this point, either `stack` is still empty or the last element popped from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`.***
