Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, and `char` is not a value from the `matching_pairs` dictionary. If `char` is a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary and the stack is not empty, the top element of the stack equals `matching_pairs[char]`.***
