#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces that have all been matched correctly, `stack` is empty, indicating that all opening symbols have been properly closed by their corresponding closing symbols.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True, indicating that the stack is empty, confirming that all opening symbols in the string 'expr' have been properly closed by their corresponding closing symbols.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all opening symbols are matched correctly with their corresponding closing symbols. The function returns `True` if all symbols are properly matched and closed; otherwise, it returns `False`. Specifically, it returns `False` if there are unmatched closing symbols or if the string is incorrectly nested. If the input string contains no symbols, it also returns `True` since there are no unmatched symbols.
