The function accepts a string `expression` and checks for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces. It returns True if all opening brackets are correctly matched and closed by their corresponding closing brackets; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not account for other characters in the string, which may lead to misinterpretation of balanced expressions if they are present alongside brackets.
