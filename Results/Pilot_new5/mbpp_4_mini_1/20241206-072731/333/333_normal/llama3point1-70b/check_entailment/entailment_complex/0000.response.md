Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description, which requires checking if the given expression is balanced. While the function does correctly check for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces, it lacks proper handling of other characters in the input string. 

The function currently ignores any characters that are not brackets, which could result in the misinterpretation of whether an expression is balanced. For instance, an expression like `"(a + b)"` would be considered balanced, but if the function were provided with an expression that contained unmatched brackets along with other characters, it might incorrectly return `True` or `False` based on the contents of `stack` alone.

To illustrate this issue, consider the expression `"(a + b))"`. The function would incorrectly return `False` because there is an unmatched closing parenthesis, but it also contains other characters that may not be accurately represented in terms of balance.

In summary, while the main logic for checking balanced brackets is implemented correctly, the function does not account for the potential impact of other characters, leading to a failure in fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.
