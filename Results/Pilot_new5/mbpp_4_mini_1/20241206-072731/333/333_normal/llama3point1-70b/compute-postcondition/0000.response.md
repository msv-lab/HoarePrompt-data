The variable `stack` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `expression` remains unchanged, as the assignment of an empty list to `stack` does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list.

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list**.
