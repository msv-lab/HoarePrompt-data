Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters and `char` is the next character in the string. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` is updated to include `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `brackets.values()` and either `stack` is empty or the character popped from `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False.***
