Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, and `char` is the first character in the expression and is not in brackets. If `char` is in the values of `brackets`, then either `stack` is not empty or the last character popped from `stack` corresponds to `char` in `brackets`.***
