Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string. If `char` is one of the characters in the set of brackets, then `stack` contains `char`. Otherwise, `stack` is an empty list and `char` is not in brackets. If `char` is in the values of `brackets`, then either `stack` is not empty or the last character popped from `stack` corresponds to `char` in `brackets.***
