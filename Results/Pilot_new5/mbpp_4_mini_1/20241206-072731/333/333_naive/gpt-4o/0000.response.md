Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to check if the given expression is balanced. However, it fails to handle the case of empty expressions correctly. For instance, when the input is an empty string `''`, the expected output should be `True` since an empty expression is considered balanced. However, the current implementation will return `False` because the stack will be empty and the `for` loop will not execute at all, leading to `stack == []` returning `True`, which is not handled correctly.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where the brackets are mismatched but not in the order that would be considered "balanced." For example, the input `[({})]` would be balanced, but if the input was `[{]}`, it would not be.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the empty string case and does not properly validate all potential cases of balanced expressions.
