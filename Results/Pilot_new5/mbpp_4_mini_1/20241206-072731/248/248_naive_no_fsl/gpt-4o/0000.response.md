Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list as input and correctly converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. The provided assertions test the function with various lists, and in each case, the output matches the expected tuple representations of those lists. 

There are no edge cases or potential input scenarios that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description, as it should handle any list of elements correctly, including empty lists and lists with varying data types. For example:

- An empty list `func_1([])` would return an empty tuple `()`.
- A list with mixed data types like `func_1([1, 'two', 3.0])` would return `(1, 'two', 3.0)`.

Since the program behaves correctly for the provided examples and additional potential cases, the correctness assessment is confirmed as True.
