Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input (referred to as `input_list`) and uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the entire list into a tuple.

This meets the requirement of converting a list to a tuple because:
1. The input is specified to be a list, which is handled correctly by the function.
2. The output is a tuple that contains all the elements of the input list in the same order, which aligns with the expected behavior as described.

Since the function will reliably convert any list input into a tuple output without exceptions or incorrect behavior, it adheres to the problem description.
