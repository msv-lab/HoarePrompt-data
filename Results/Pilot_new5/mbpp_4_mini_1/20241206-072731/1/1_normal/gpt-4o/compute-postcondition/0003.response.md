Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements found in both lists. It does not handle the case where either list is empty; in such a scenario, the function will return an empty tuple since there would be no common elements to sort. Additionally, the function correctly accounts for elements of any data type present in the lists. **
