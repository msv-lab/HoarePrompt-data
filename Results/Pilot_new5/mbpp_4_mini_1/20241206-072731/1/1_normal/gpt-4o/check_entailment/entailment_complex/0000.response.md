Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must find the shared elements from the given two lists.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts two lists (or tuples) as arguments, `list1` and `list2`. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that two lists are to be considered.

2. **Finding Common Elements**: The function uses set intersection (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) to determine the shared elements between the two lists. This is an efficient and correct way to find common elements, as sets inherently eliminate duplicates and allow for straightforward comparison.

3. **Returning a Tuple**: The common elements extracted from the intersection are sorted and returned as a tuple. This matches the requirement to return the shared elements, and sorting ensures that the order is consistent, which is a common expectation when returning lists or collections.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function does not explicitly handle empty lists, but as explained in the annotations, it will return an empty tuple if there are no common elements (which is the correct behavior). This means that it effectively handles cases where one or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the implementation correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two input lists as specified in the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
