Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements (or intersection) between the two lists. 

Here's how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two lists (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`), which aligns with the requirement to operate on two lists to find shared elements.

2. **Finding Shared Elements**: The operation `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` effectively computes the intersection of the two sets derived from the lists. This means it identifies all elements that appear in both lists.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns the result as a tuple, which is consistent with the problem description's implication of returning the shared elements in some form.

The logic works for all cases, including:
- If both lists are empty, it will return an empty tuple `()`.
- If there are no shared elements, it will return an empty tuple `()`.
- If there are shared elements, it will return a tuple containing those elements.

Overall, the program accurately follows the instructions from the problem description, ensuring that it will consistently produce the correct output for any valid input.
