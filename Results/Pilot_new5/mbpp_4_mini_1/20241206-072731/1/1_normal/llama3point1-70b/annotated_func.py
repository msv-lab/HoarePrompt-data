#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the lists test_tup1 and test_tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the unique elements from the two lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.
