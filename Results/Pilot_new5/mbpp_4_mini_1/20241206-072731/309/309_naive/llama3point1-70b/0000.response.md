Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and then checking if the length of this set is 1. This means that if the set has only one unique character, then all the characters in the original string are the same.

Here are some cases that the function handles correctly:
1. For an empty string `""`, the set will also be empty, and `len(set(""))` will be `0`, which correctly implies that there are no characters (and thus they can be considered the same).
2. For a string with one character, such as `"a"`, the set will contain only one element, so `len(set("a"))` will be `1`, indicating that all characters (just the one) are the same.
3. For a string with identical characters, such as `"aaaa"`, the set will again have only one element, so `len(set("aaaa"))` will be `1`.
4. For a string with different characters like `"abc"`, the set will have three elements, thus `len(set("abc"))` will be `3`, indicating not all characters are the same.

The function performs correctly for all potential inputs, thus validating the problem description.
