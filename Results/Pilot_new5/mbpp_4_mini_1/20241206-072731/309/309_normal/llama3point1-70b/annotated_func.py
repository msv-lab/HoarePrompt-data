#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in the string 's' are the same, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle empty strings specifically, but for an empty string, it would also return True since there are no differing characters.
