The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`. Since `s` is guaranteed to contain at least one character (as the condition `not s` is false), `first_char` will hold the first character of `s`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
