To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the program and see if it meets the requirements.

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise AND from the given two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. The program uses `zip` to iterate over corresponding elements in the two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`.
2. It applies the bitwise AND operator `&` on the elements of the tuples.
3. It constructs a new tuple from the results of the bitwise AND operations.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- If the tuples have different lengths, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which may lead to missing elements in the output. This means that tuples of unequal lengths will not be fully processed, and some elements from the longer tuple will be ignored.
- The function does not handle cases where either of the tuples might be empty. An empty tuple input should ideally return an empty tuple.

### Example Cases:
- Case 1: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` should return `(0, 0, 2)` since:
  - `1 & 4 = 0`
  - `2 & 5 = 0`
  - `3 & 6 = 2`
  
- Case 2: `func_1((1, 2), (4, 5, 6))` should return `(0, 0)`, since it only considers the first two elements of the longer tuple and ignores the third.
  
- Case 3: `func_1((), ())` should return `()`, but if one of the tuples is empty, it still expects to be handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the tuples are of unequal lengths, nor does it handle empty tuples in a consistent manner.

Correctness: **False**.
