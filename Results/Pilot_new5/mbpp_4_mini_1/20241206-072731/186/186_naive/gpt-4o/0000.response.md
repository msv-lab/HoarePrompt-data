To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the problem and the code.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to extract the element-wise operations from two given tuples.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))

# Test cases
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program uses `zip` to pair corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. It performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the paired elements.
3. The result is collected into a tuple.

### Test Cases:
- The provided test cases check the function for different pairs of tuples and assert the expected results.

### Potential Cases:
Now we need to examine any potential edge cases or inputs where this function might not perform as described:

1. **Empty Tuples**: If we provide two empty tuples, the expected output should also be an empty tuple. The function handles this case correctly.
   ```python
   assert func_1((), ()) == ()
   ```

2. **Mismatched Lengths**: If the tuples have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the shortest tuple, which is an important behavior to consider. However, based on the problem description, it does not specify how to handle tuples of unequal lengths. Thus:
   ```python
   assert func_1((1, 2), (3,)) == (1, 0)
   ```

3. **Negative Numbers**: The function does not explicitly state how to handle negative numbers, but bitwise operations on negative integers are defined in Python. Still, it's worth considering if the expected behavior is clear. For example:
   ```python
   assert func_1((-1,), (1,)) == (1,)  # Negative number with positive
   ```

4. **Non-integer Values**: The function does not check the types of the elements in the tuples. If we pass non-integer types (like strings or floats), it will raise a `TypeError` during the bitwise operation. This indicates that it is not robust against all potential input types:
   ```python
   try:
       func_1((1, 2), ('a', 'b'))  # Should raise an error
   except TypeError:
       pass  # This is the expected behavior
   ```

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not explicitly handle mismatched lengths or non-integer values, it is not sufficiently robust for all input cases. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
