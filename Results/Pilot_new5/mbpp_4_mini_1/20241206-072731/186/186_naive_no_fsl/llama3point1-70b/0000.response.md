Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to extract elementwise tuples from two given tuples. However, it uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on the elements of the tuples. This is incorrect in the context of extracting tuples, as the problem description does not specify a bitwise operation but rather implies a direct elementwise extraction or comparison.

For instance, consider the following case:

```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```

According to the program, the output would be:

```python
func_1(tup1, tup2)  # This would evaluate to (0, 0, 0)
```

This is not an appropriate operation based on the problem description, which does not mention any form of bitwise operation. Furthermore, if the inputs were strings or other non-integer types, the program would throw an error, as the `&` operator does not apply to those types.

Therefore, since the program does not handle the general case of tuple extraction correctly and assumes a specific kind of operation (bitwise AND) that is not defined in the problem description, the program is deemed incorrect.
