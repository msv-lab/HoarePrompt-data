To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first examine the problem description and the source code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

The function `func_1` applies the bitwise AND operation to the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns these results as a new tuple.

### Initial Assessment
1. **Bitwise AND Operation:** The use of the `&` operator is correct for performing a bitwise AND between elements of the two tuples.
2. **Zip Function:** The `zip` function pairs elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, which means that only the pairs up to the length of the shorter tuple will be processed. This aspect seems to align with the problem description, which does not specify any requirement to handle tuples of different lengths beyond ignoring excess elements.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **Empty Tuples:** If both `tup1` and `tup2` are empty, the output should also be an empty tuple, which appears to be handled correctly.
- **Tuples of Different Lengths:** The program will ignore any excess elements in the longer tuple, which is acceptable as per the problem description.
- **Single Element Tuples:** If one tuple has a single element and the other is empty, the result should correctly be an empty tuple.
- **Elements of Various Types:** If tuples contain non-integer types (like strings or floats), the program would raise a `TypeError` during the bitwise operation, which is not mentioned in the problem description and would lead to unexpected behavior.

### Assessment of Output Hints
**Output hints:** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only compute the AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any excess elements in the longer tuple.

The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the code, matching the expected behavior described in the problem description. They correctly explain how the function handles tuples of different lengths and states that the excess elements will be ignored.

### Conclusion
The function does not handle the case where the elements of the tuples are not integers (or do not support the bitwise AND operation). This could result in a runtime error if such cases are encountered, which is a significant omission in terms of correctness.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The program does not account for cases where the tuple elements might not be integers (e.g., strings or floats), leading to potential runtime errors during execution. This non-handling of edge cases implies that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
