Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number as per the problem description. However, it incorrectly calculates Fibonacci numbers instead. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n - 1) + L(n - 2) for n > 1

The provided program, `func_1`, correctly returns L(0) and L(1), but the loop that calculates subsequent values incorrectly implements the Fibonacci sequence rather than the Lucas sequence. Specifically, the variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 2 and 1 respectively, which are correct for the first two Lucas numbers, but the update step `a, b = b, a + b` calculates Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers. 

For example, if we call `func_1(9)`, the program will not return the 9th Lucas number (which is 76) because it is actually calculating Fibonacci numbers.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
