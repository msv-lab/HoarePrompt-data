To assess the correctness of the given function `func_1`, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem Description:** The function needs to find the n-th Lucas number.

**Lucas Numbers:** The Lucas number sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

**Code Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

1. **Base Cases:** The function correctly returns 2 for n = 0 and 1 for n = 1.
2. **Lucas Number Calculation:** For n > 1, it starts with the correct initial values (2, 1) and iteratively computes the Lucas numbers.

**Output Hints Analysis:** 
The output hints state that:
- The function returns 2 for n = 0.
- The function returns 1 for n = 1.
- For any n > 1, it returns the Fibonacci number F(n + 1).

**Evaluation of Output Hints:**
The hint that the function returns the Fibonacci number F(n + 1) for n > 1 is incorrect. The function is indeed calculating Lucas numbers, not Fibonacci numbers, although there is a relationship between them.

**Edge Case Consideration:** 
The problem description states the function should only handle non-negative integers. However, if a negative integer is passed, the function does not handle this case and will result in an error. The output hints also imply that negative integers are not addressed, which means there is potential for unexpected behavior if such cases are tested.

**Conclusion:**
Although the core logic of calculating Lucas numbers is mostly correct, the statement in the output hints regarding the function returning Fibonacci numbers for n > 1 is misleading and incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for negative integers, which is a significant oversight.

Therefore, the function does not satisfy the requirement as specified in the problem description and has unhandled edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.
