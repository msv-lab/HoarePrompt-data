According to the code, the loop executes over a range that starts at 2 and ends at `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, as the range creates the sequence from 2 to `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1, it implies that `n` must be at least 2 for the range to include any values. 

At the end of the loop, the loop variable `_` will take on values from 2 to `n`, inclusive, which means that at the start of the loop, `_` should be initialized to 2. 

Based on these considerations, the following state modifications need to be made before the loop executes:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2**
