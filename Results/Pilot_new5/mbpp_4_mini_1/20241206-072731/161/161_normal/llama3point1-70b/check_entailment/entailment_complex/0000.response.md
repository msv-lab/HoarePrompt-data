The annotated program is designed to calculate the nth Lucas number but incorrectly refers to the calculation as the nth Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers but start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

To summarize the requirements:
- The function must return the 0th Lucas number as 2.
- The function must return the 1st Lucas number as 1.
- For n greater than 1, the function should return the nth Lucas number, which is derived from the formula: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).

Now, let's analyze the program:

- When `n == 0`, it correctly returns 2, which is the 0th Lucas number.
- When `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1, which is the 1st Lucas number.
- For `n > 1`, the program calculates the nth value using the Fibonacci number logic instead of the Lucas number logic.

The issue arises in the final return statement for `n > 1`, where it generates Fibonacci numbers rather than Lucas numbers. For example:
- The 2nd Lucas number should be 3 (2 + 1).
- The 3rd Lucas number should be 4 (1 + 3).
- The 4th Lucas number should be 7 (3 + 4), and so on.

Since the program fails to compute the correct Lucas numbers for values of `n > 1`, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
