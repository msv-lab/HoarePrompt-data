According to the code, the loop variable starts at 2 and increments with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable must be less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable was 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since we want the loop variable to be 3 in this case) and the loop variable will be incremented to 3. 

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, loop variable is 3**
