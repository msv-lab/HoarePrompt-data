The values of `a` and `b` are swapped such that `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. The initial values are `a = 3` and `b = 4`. After executing the code:

- The new value of `a` becomes `4` (the previous value of `b`).
- The new value of `b` becomes `3 + 4 = 7`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 4, and the loop variable is also unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, loop variable is 4**
