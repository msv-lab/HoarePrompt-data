Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for all cases. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The provided assertions in the program are:
- `assert func_1(9) == 76`
- `assert func_1(4) == 7`
- `assert func_1(3) == 4`

The function `func_1(n)` is implemented correctly for the base cases and the iterative computation. However, it fails to return the correct Lucas number for n=9. 

If we compute L(9) according to the defined formula:
- L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3
- L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4
- L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7
- L(5) = L(4) + L(3) = 7 + 4 = 11
- L(6) = L(5) + L(4) = 11 + 7 = 18
- L(7) = L(6) + L(5) = 18 + 11 = 29
- L(8) = L(7) + L(6) = 29 + 18 = 47
- L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76

While the output for `func_1(9)` is correct (it returns 76), the function doesn't provide assertions for all relevant cases. Notably, the function does not handle negative values of n, which are not defined in the context of Lucas numbers. For instance, calling `func_1(-1)` would not provide a meaningful result. 

Thus, the function's failure to handle negative inputs and potentially other edge cases leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Therefore, the overall correctness is **False**.
