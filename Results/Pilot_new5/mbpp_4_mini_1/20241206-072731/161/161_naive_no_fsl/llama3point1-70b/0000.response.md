To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it accurately computes the n-th Lucas number as per the problem description.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

Now let's review the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

The program works as follows:
1. It checks if `n` is 0 and returns 2 (which is correct).
2. It checks if `n` is 1 and returns 1 (which is correct).
3. For values of `n` greater than 1, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1, respectively). It then uses a loop to calculate subsequent Lucas numbers up to `n`.

In the loop:
- The tuple `(a, b)` is updated such that `a` takes the value of `b` (the previous Lucas number), and `b` takes the value of `a + b` (the sum of the two previous Lucas numbers).
- Finally, it returns `b`, which will hold the value of L(n).

Let's analyze potential edge cases:
- For `n = 2`: 
  - Expected output: L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3.
  - Program output: `b` will become 3 after one iteration. This is correct.
  
- For `n = 3`: 
  - Expected output: L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
  - Program output: `b` will become 4 after two iterations. This is correct.
  
- For `n = 4`: 
  - Expected output: L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7.
  - Program output: `b` will become 7 after three iterations. This is correct.

Since the program correctly handles all tested cases, including edge cases for small values of `n`, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program accurately computes the n-th Lucas number for all non-negative integers n, adhering to the definitions provided in the problem description.
