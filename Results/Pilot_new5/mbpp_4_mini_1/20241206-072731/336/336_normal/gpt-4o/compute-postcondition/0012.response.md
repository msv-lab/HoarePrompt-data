The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if certain conditions are met, the function will return:

- Case 1: False
- Case 2: False
- Case 3: False
- Case 4: True, confirming that all elements at the odd indices of the list `lst` are odd integers, and the list has an even length, ensuring the function would not return False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and check if all elements at the odd indices are odd integers while also verifying that the list has an even length. If these conditions are satisfied, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if all elements at the odd indices of lst are odd integers and the list has an even length; otherwise, it returns False.**
