The provided Python function `func_1` is supposed to check whether every odd index of the list contains odd numbers, according to the problem description. Let's analyze the function and its correctness based on the given conditions.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function iterates over the indices of the list starting from 1 (the first odd index) and increments by 2, effectively checking all odd indices.
2. For each odd index `i`, it checks if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds any even number, it immediately returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at the odd indices, it returns `True`.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:
- The function correctly checks all odd indices for odd numbers, returning `False` if any even number is found.
- The potential issue arises when considering the requirement that every odd index must contain odd numbers. The function does not handle the case when the input list is of odd length. According to the problem description, there is no explicit requirement related to the length of the list, but the function does not confirm that the list has an even length either.

### Cases from Assertions:
- The assertions provided check some cases:
  - `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` as it correctly identifies that indices 1, 3, 5, and 7 (1, 3, 7 numbers) are odd.
  - `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True`, which is incorrect as index 1 has an odd number, but index 2 is even. It seems to pass incorrectly.
  - `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` correctly because index 1 has an even number.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly lists of odd lengths, which can lead to a misleading return value. Additionally, it incorrectly passes some cases that should return `False`, i.e., when there are even numbers at odd indices.

Thus, the function does not adhere strictly to the problem description as it can yield incorrect results based on the length of the list and the values at odd indices.

**Correctness: False**
