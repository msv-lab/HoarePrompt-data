The given problem description requires a function to check whether every odd index in a list contains odd numbers. 

Let's analyze the provided function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through the list starting from the first odd index (index 1) and then checks every second index (i.e., indexes 1, 3, 5, ...).
2. It returns `False` if it finds any even number at these odd indices.
3. If all odd indexed elements are odd, the function returns `True`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If the list is empty, the function will return `True` since there are no odd indices to check.
- If the list has only one element, there are no odd indices, so it will also return `True`.
- If the list has an odd length (e.g., [1, 2, 3]), it only checks up to index 2, which means it does not check the last element if it would have been at an odd index.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function returns `False` if any element at an odd index of the list is even.
- If all elements at odd indices are odd and the list has an even length, it returns `True`.
- However, if the list has an odd length, the function does not handle this case explicitly, leading to a potential oversight.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly follow the problem description in all potential cases. According to the problem description, every odd index must contain odd numbers, which also implies the function should fully account for lists of odd length. Since the function does not explicitly check the last element in a list with an odd length, it may return `True` even when that last element is even.

**Counterexample:** For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return `False` as expected (since `2` is at index `1`), but for `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, it will return `True` incorrectly (since `4` at index `3` is even and would not be checked).

Therefore, the function does not work correctly in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
