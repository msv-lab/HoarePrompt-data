To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we will analyze the program and see if it adheres to the requirements.

**Problem description:** The task is to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function iterates through each index `i` in the list `lst`. It checks:
- If `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`)
- If the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`)

If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even values at odd indices, it returns `True`.

**Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list `[]` should return `True` since there are no indices to violate the condition.
2. A list with only even indices (e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`) should also return `True` as it does not violate the condition regarding odd indices.
3. A list where all odd indices contain odd numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) should return `True`.
4. A list where one odd index contains an even number (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`) should return `False` since index 1 contains the even number 2.

The function seems to correctly cover the requirements of the problem description.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints state that the function checks for even numbers at odd indices and will return `False` if it finds any. It also mentions that if all odd indices contain odd numbers (or if the list is empty), it returns `True`. This aligns with what the program does.

Given the analysis of both the program and the output hints, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to fulfill the problem description for all potential cases.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program does handle all potential cases as described and does not miss any edge cases, we conclude the following:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly checks that every odd index contains odd numbers as required by the problem description.
