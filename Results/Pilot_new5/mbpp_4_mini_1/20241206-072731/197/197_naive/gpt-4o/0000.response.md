To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation:

**Problem Description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

The function is supposed to count how many times each element from the list `elements` appears in the tuple `tup`. 

### Analyzing the Program:
- The program uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in `elements` and counts how many times that element appears in `tup` using the `count()` method of tuples.
- The results of these counts are summed to get the total occurrence.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `3` because 'a' appears twice and 'b' appears once.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])` should return `6` because '1' appears three times, '4' appears twice, and '7' appears once.
3. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` should return `2` because '1' and '2' each appear once.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `elements` contains elements that are not in `tup`, the counts will simply sum to zero for those elements, which is correct behavior.
2. If `tup` is empty, the count should be `0` for any `elements` list, which is also correctly handled by the program.
3. If `elements` is an empty list, the function should return `0` since there are no elements to count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as per the problem statement and handles edge cases as expected. The use of the `count()` method for tuples is appropriate in this context.

Therefore, after analyzing the program and the provided test cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple as specified in the problem description.
