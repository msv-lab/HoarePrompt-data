Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a tuple and a list as inputs and correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the list within the tuple. It uses the `count` method of the tuple for each element in the list, summing the results. 

This approach will handle various scenarios correctly:
1. If the list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
2. If the tuple is empty, the function also returns 0, since there are no elements to count.
3. If elements in the list do not exist in the tuple, those counts will correctly contribute 0 to the total.
4. If the same element appears multiple times in the list but not in the tuple, it will also correctly contribute 0 for those occurrences.

There are no edge cases that make this implementation fail based on the provided problem description. Thus, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases.
