Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to count the occurrences of all elements in the provided list that are present in the given tuple. However, it does not handle the case where the list of elements contains an item that is not present in the tuple. 

For example, if we test the function with the following input:

```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'e'])  # 'e' is not in the tuple
```

The expected output is `2` (since 'a' appears 2 times), but the function will count 'e' as 0 occurrences, resulting in a total of `2`, which is correct in this case. 

However, if the tuple was empty:

```python
assert func_1((), ['a', 'b'])  # Should return 0, since there are no elements to count
```

The function would return `0`, which is expected. 

The main issue arises when there are edge cases with different data types in the tuple and the list, or when there are unexpected inputs (like nested lists or other data types). Since the input types and data structures are not enforced or checked, this could lead to incorrect behavior if unexpected data types are passed.

While the provided test cases seem to work correctly, the function's assumptions about input integrity and types are flawed. Thus, because of potential edge cases that may not be handled, the program cannot be deemed fully correct.
