Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks for a function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. However, the provided program does not return the count of occurrences for each element of the list; instead, it returns the total count of occurrences of any element in the list found in the tuple.

For example, if we have the following inputs:

```python
tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)
lst = [2, 3]
```

The expected output should be a count of how many times each element from `lst` appears in `tup`, which would be:

- 2 appears 2 times
- 3 appears 1 time

However, the code will return `3` (which is the sum of the occurrences of elements 2 and 3), rather than the individual counts of each element as expected by the problem description.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement to "count the occurrence of all elements of list in a tuple" in a way that aligns with the typical interpretation of that requirement.
