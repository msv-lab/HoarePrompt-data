Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`lst`), which aligns with the specified inputs.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses a generator expression to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The use of `tup.count(element)` ensures that for each element in `lst`, the total count of that element in `tup` is computed.

3. **Summing Counts**: The function sums these counts using `sum(...)`, effectively providing the total count of all elements from `lst` found in `tup`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases:
   - If `lst` is empty, the generator expression produces no elements, and `sum()` returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
   - If `tup` contains no matching elements, the count for those elements will naturally contribute 0 to the sum, which is also correct.

The annotations in the code clarify that it returns the total counts, which confirms that the function meets the problem's requirements across all potential cases.

Thus, the implementation fulfills the problem description accurately and consistently.
