The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(tup, elements)` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. This matches the expected input types as per the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The core logic of counting occurrences is done through a generator expression inside the `sum()` function: 
   ```python
   count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
   ```
   - Here, for each `element` in `elements`, the function `tup.count(element)` counts how many times that specific `element` appears in the `tup`.
   - The results are summed to get the total count.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences, which is a non-negative integer. This satisfies the problem's requirement to return the count of occurrences.

4. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles edge cases as well:
   - If `elements` is empty, the generator expression will produce no elements, leading `sum()` to return `0`, which is the expected result.
   - If none of the `elements` are found in `tup`, the `count` will also correctly yield `0` since summing zero counts results in zero.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided (e.g., `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`) demonstrate the correctness of the function for various test cases, confirming it behaves as expected.

Since the function adheres to the problem description for all specified scenarios and correctly implements the counting mechanism, we can conclude that it is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
