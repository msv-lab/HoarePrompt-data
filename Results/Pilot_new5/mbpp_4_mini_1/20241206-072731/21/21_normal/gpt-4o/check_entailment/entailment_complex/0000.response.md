Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty list. While it correctly finds the smallest number in a non-empty list using the `min` function, it will raise a `ValueError` if the input list `lst` is empty. The problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, but since the function raises an error in that case, it fails to meet the requirement of providing a valid output for all potential inputs as expected.

In summary, the function does not fulfill the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list for every possible case, specifically when the list is empty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
