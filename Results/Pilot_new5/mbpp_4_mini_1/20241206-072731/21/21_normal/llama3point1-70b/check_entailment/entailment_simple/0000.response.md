Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in that list.

The use of `min(nums)` is appropriate because it directly addresses the requirement to find the smallest number. The function will successfully return the smallest number regardless of the size of the list (as long as the list is not empty) and will handle any integers contained within the list.

For example:
- If `nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, the function will return `1`.
- If `nums = [-10, 2, 0]`, the function will return `-10`.

The program meets the problem description for all potential cases where the input is a non-empty list of integers. Thus, it is correct.
