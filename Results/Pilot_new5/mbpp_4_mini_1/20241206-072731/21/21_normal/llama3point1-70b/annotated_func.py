#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the minimum integer in the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the minimum integer from that list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` since there is no minimum value to return.
