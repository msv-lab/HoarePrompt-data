Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and computes the element-wise differences of the corresponding elements from each tuple. 

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function is designed to take two tuples containing numeric elements. The problem description specifies that these tuples should be of the same length, which is stated in the program's comment.

2. **Element-wise subtraction**: The program uses `zip(tup1, tup2)` to pair elements from the two tuples based on their indices. This allows the function to subtract corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

3. **Output**: The result of the subtraction for each pair of elements is wrapped in a `tuple()` constructor, which ensures that the output is a tuple containing the differences, as required by the problem description.

4. **General case handling**: The function handles any numeric types (integers, floats), which aligns with the general expectation of numeric subtraction. Also, due to the use of `zip`, it gracefully handles tuples of the same length.

Overall, the implementation directly fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description without any logical errors or omissions. Thus, it is deemed correct.
