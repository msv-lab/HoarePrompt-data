You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of equal length containing numerical values.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the difference of corresponding elements from tuples tup1 and tup2, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical values and returns a tuple where each element is the difference of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of equal length; if they are not, a ValueError may occur during execution.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
