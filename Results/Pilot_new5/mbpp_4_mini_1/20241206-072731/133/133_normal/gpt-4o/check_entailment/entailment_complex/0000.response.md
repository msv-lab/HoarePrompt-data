Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to take in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be of equal length and contain numerical values.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function correctly implements the logic for subtracting corresponding elements of the two tuples. It uses the `zip` function to iterate through both tuples simultaneously, allowing it to access each corresponding pair of elements (a, b).

3. **Returning a Tuple**: The result is constructed as a new tuple, where each element is the difference of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to produce a tuple of differences.

4. **Handling Input Requirements**: The function assumes that the input tuples are of equal length, which is acknowledged in the annotations. While the current implementation does not explicitly handle cases where the tuples might not be of equal length (and could raise a ValueError), this assumption is aligned with the problem description, which does not specify how to handle unequal lengths.

5. **Verification with Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, demonstrating its correctness in producing the specified output.

Overall, the function `func_1` fulfills the task of subtracting the elements of one tuple from another according to the provided problem description, thereby confirming its correctness.
