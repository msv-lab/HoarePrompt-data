To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description, which states that the function should subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`. There is no validation for the lengths of the tuples, which means that if the lengths are not the same, the program will not handle it gracefully.
2. **Logic**: The logic of subtracting elements using a generator expression with `zip` is correct as it pairs elements from both tuples and performs the subtraction.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the `zip` function will only process pairs until the shorter tuple is exhausted. This means that any elements in the longer tuple will be ignored, leading to incorrect results.
   - If either tuple is empty, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is valid, but if this behavior is not specified in the problem description, it could be seen as incorrect.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case where the tuples have different lengths:
```python
func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)) 
```
Expected behavior should be to handle the differing lengths, but with the current logic, it would only compute `(1 - 3, 2 - 4)` resulting in `(-2, -2)`, and the element `5` would be ignored.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths, which is a significant oversight. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
