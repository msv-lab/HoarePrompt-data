Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not handle the case where the integer L is greater than the length of the list. For instance, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior would be to return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part, but the program will throw an `IndexError` when trying to access `lst[L:]`. Thus, the code does not accommodate all potential cases as required by the problem description.
