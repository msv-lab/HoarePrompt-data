You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the list of lists 'matrix', where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` containing numbers and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix. However, if `n` is not within the valid range (0 <= n < number of columns), the code does not handle this case, potentially leading to an IndexError if the input does not conform to the stated conditions. Additionally, if `matrix` is empty, the function will also raise an error since accessing `matrix[0]` will fail.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
