To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The function is supposed to find the maximum value in the nth column of a given matrix represented as a list of lists. 

Here's how the function works:
1. It takes a matrix and an integer `n`, which represents the column index.
2. It constructs a list `nth_column`, which consists of the elements from the nth column of each row.
3. Finally, it returns the maximum value from `nth_column`.

Now, let's consider some potential cases and edge cases:

1. **Valid Input**: The provided assertions test the function against valid inputs and expected outputs. These cases seem to work as expected.
   
2. **Zero Indexing**: The function uses zero-based indexing. If the user inputs `n` as 2, it correctly accesses the third column.

3. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty (`[]`), calling `func_1([], 0)` would lead to an IndexError when trying to access `row[n]` since there are no rows to iterate over.

4. **Single Row Matrix**: If the matrix has only one row (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3]]`), the function should return the element in the specified column, but if `n` is out of bounds (e.g., `n = 3`), it will raise an IndexError.

5. **Irregular Matrix**: If the rows of the matrix have different lengths (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]`), and if `n` is set to 2, it would again raise an IndexError for the first row.

6. **Negative Index**: If `n` is negative, it accesses columns from the end of the row, which may or may not be intended behavior. 

Considering these potential issues, especially the empty matrix case and the index out of bounds case, the function does not handle these situations properly.

Therefore, the function is not correct as it does not handle every possible case described in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**  
The program fails with inputs like an empty matrix (`[]`) or if `n` is out of bounds for the provided matrix structure.
