Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. However, it incorrectly defines odd numbers in the filtering condition. The condition `num % 2 != 0` is indeed the correct check for odd numbers. However, it does not return the even numbers as expected based on the problem description, which could lead to confusion about the intended behavior.

Additionally, the function does not handle an empty list correctly by returning an empty list, which is expected. While it seems to work for positive odd integers, if the input includes negative numbers or zero, the program would still consider them while the problem description is not clear about such cases.

For instance, if the input is `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `[-3, -1, 1, 3]`, which is correct in terms of filtering odd numbers but might not be what a user expects if they thought the function would somehow handle or return even numbers or zero as a filter. 

Thus, the program does not explicitly handle all cases as required by the problem description.
