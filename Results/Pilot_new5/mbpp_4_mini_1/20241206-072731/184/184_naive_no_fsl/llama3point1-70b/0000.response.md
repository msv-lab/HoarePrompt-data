Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should filter odd numbers, but the implementation in the program actually returns odd numbers, thus it does not filter them out. 

For example, given the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected behavior based on the description would be to return only the even numbers (i.e., `[2, 4]`), but instead, the function returns `[1, 3, 5]`, which are the odd numbers.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to a determination of incorrectness.
