To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, letâ€™s analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

**Program:**
```python
import bisect

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)

# Sample assertions for testing
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order (`sorted_list`) and an integer (`value`). It returns the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining the order. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the list, indicating the position at the end. If `value` is smaller than or equal to the first element, it returns 0, indicating the position at the start. This behavior ensures that the insertion point is correctly identified for any integer value.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Assessment of the Code:**
   - The function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which indeed finds the index where the `value` can be inserted in `sorted_list`.
   - The behavior described in the output hints aligns well with what `bisect.bisect_right` does:
     - It returns the length of the list if the value is greater than all elements.
     - It returns 0 if the value is less than or equal to the first element.
   - The edge cases of having values equal to existing elements in the list are also handled correctly, as `bisect_right` will return the index after the rightmost occurrence of that value.

2. **Output Hints Validation:**
   - The output hints describe the expected behavior accurately and are consistent with the function's implementation.
   - The example assertions provided confirm that the function works correctly for the cases tested, including the edge cases mentioned in the output hints.

### Conclusion:

Since the code adheres to the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints accurately describe its behavior, I cannot find any example where the program does not work correctly.

Correctness: **True**. 

The `func_1` function correctly locates the insertion point for any integer value in a sorted list, as verified by the problem description, implementation, and output hints.
