You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in 'sorted_list' where 'value' would be inserted to maintain sorted order, using bisect.bisect_right.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order (`sorted_list`) and an integer (`value`). It returns the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining the order. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the list, indicating the position at the end. If `value` is smaller than or equal to the first element, it returns 0, indicating the position at the start. This behavior ensures that the insertion point is correctly identified for any integer value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
