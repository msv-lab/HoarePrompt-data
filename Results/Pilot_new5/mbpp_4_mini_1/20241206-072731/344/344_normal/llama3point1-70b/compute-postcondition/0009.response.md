Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns `i`, which is 2. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
