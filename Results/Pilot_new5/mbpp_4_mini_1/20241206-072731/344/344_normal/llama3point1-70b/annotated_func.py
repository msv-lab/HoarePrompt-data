#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer that may or may not be present in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and if `value` is not found in `sorted_list`, it is greater than the last element of `sorted_list`. If `value` is found, `i` would be the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If the list is empty, then `i` is 0.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list', which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function does not handle the case where the first element is less than the value, as there are no checks for returning 1 or 2 based on the annotations.
