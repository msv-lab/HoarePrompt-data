Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the `sorted_list`, and for each element, it checks if that element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. If such an element is found, the index of that element is returned, which is the correct position to insert the `value` such that the order of the list is maintained.

If no element in the `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the program returns `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct position for inserting the `value` at the end of the list.

For example:
- For `sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 6]` and `value = 5`, the function correctly returns `2`.
- For `sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 6]` and `value = 2`, the function correctly returns `1`.
- For `sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 6]` and `value = 7`, the function correctly returns `4`.

As all potential cases are handled correctly, the implementation correctly follows the problem description.
