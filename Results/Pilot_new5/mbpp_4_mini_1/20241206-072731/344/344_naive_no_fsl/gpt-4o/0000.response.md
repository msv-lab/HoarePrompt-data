Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list using the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. 

- The `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` function returns the index at which the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `sorted_list`. 
- The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:

1. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the expected return value is `4`, which is correct because `6` would be inserted at the end of the list.
2. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the expected return value is `2`, which is correct since `3` should be inserted after `2` at index `2`.
3. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the expected return value is `4`, which is correct as `7` would also be inserted at the end of the list.

No potential edge cases have been overlooked in this context, as the program handles the insertion of values that are less than, equal to, or greater than the existing elements in the sorted list correctly. Thus, the program behaves as expected for any valid input based on the problem description.
