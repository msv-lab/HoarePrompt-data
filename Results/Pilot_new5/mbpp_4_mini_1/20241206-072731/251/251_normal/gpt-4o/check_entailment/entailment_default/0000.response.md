To assess the correctness of the provided Python function for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta), where:
- r is the radial distance from the origin.
- theta is the angle in radians calculated using the `atan2` function.

### Code Review:
```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)
```
The code calculates:
- `r` correctly using the Euclidean distance formula.
- `theta` using `math.atan2`, which correctly handles the angle in all four quadrants.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts real numbers x and y and returns r and theta, calculated correctly for any real input values. They assert that there are no edge cases.

### Analysis:
1. The function appears to correctly compute `r` and `theta` for positive, negative, and zero inputs of x and y.
2. The hints suggest there are no edge cases; however, it is important to consider:
   - If both x and y are zero (0, 0), the function would compute `r` as 0. The angle, `theta`, will be `atan2(0, 0)`, which is technically undefined. However, `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0, which is conventionally used.

### Conclusion:
Since the output hints state there are no edge cases and the function does handle the case where both x and y are zero by returning (0, 0), it appears to cover all potential cases as described.

Therefore, based on the description, the code does what it is supposed to do and the output hints accurately reflect the behavior of the function in all scenarios.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all real values of x and y, including the edge case of (0, 0), returning the expected results.
