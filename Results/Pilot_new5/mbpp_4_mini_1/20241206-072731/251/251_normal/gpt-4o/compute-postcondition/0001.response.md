The variable `theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `theta` based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `theta` is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)`**.
