To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we start with the initial state where `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. The line of code uses the `math.hypot` function, which computes the Euclidean norm, effectively calculating the distance from the point `(x, y)` to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The variable `r` is assigned the value of `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is computed as \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). 

The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, so we retain their original states. 

Output State: **`x` is a real number representing the x-coordinate, `y` is a real number representing the y-coordinate, `r` is equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)**.
