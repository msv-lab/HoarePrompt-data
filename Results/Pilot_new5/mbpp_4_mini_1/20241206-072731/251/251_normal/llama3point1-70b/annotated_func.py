#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r which is equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and phi which is equal to math.atan2(y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns their polar coordinates `r` (the distance from the origin, calculated as sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and `phi` (the angle in radians, calculated using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases since the function correctly computes both values based on the input coordinates.
