Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, if the input coordinates are negative, such as `func_1(-3, -4)`, the result will be `(5.0, -2.214297435588181)` which is indeed correct. However, if the output is checked against the expected outputs that are given for positive coordinates only, the program does not explicitly validate or return expected values for a broader range of input cases, especially edge cases where `x` or `y` might be zero. For instance:
- Input `(0, 0)` should result in a polar coordinate of `(0, undefined)`, but the program will currently return `(0.0, 0.0)` which does not make sense.

Thus, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
