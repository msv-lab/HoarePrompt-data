The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than 2, or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by any integer in that range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
