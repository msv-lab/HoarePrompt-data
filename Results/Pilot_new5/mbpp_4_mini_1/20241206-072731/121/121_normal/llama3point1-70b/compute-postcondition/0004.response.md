The variable `count` is assigned the value of 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but it is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, and `count` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`; `count` is 1**.
