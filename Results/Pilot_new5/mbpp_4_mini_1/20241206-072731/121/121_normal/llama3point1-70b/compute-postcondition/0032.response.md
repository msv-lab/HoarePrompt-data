Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it searches for the next prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, and returns the nth such prime. This functionality implies that the function can potentially run indefinitely if there is an issue with `func_1`, as there is no exit condition in the loop besides finding the required prime. **
