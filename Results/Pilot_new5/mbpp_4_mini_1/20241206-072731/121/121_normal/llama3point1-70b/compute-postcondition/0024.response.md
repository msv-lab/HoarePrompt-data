The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 3, so the new value of `count` becomes 4. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 4, `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 4, `num` is 9**
