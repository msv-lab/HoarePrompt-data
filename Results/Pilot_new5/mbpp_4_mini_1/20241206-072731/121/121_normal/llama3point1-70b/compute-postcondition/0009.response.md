The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so after executing the code, the new value of `count` becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the result of `func_1(num)` is true; and the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
