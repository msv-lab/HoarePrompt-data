To assess the correctness of the provided Python program and its functions, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Function Analysis

1. **Function 1: `func_1(n)`**
   - **Code:**
     ```python
     def func_1(n):
         """Check if a number is prime."""
         if n < 2:
             return False
         for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
             if n % i == 0:
                 return False
         return True
     ```
   - **Output Description:** This function checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility for numbers greater than or equal to 2.
   - **Assessment:** This function correctly identifies prime numbers as per the problem description. The implementation is standard for checking primality.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
   - **Code:**
     ```python
     def func_2(n):
         """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
         if n == 1:
             return 7
         count = 1
         num = 7
         while True:
             if func_1(num):
                 if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                     count += 1
                     if count == n:
                         return num
             num += 1
     ```
   - **Output Description:** This function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, returning 7 for `n=1` and searching for subsequent primes that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
   - **Assessment:** The logic appears sound, as the function checks for prime status and also includes the necessary modulo condition. 

### Edge Case Consideration
- One potential concern is the infinite loop in `func_2(n)` if `func_1(num)` does not behave as expected. However, since `func_1` is correctly implemented, this should not be an issue.

### Output Hints Analysis
1. **Output hints for `func_1`:** These align with the code, confirming that it correctly identifies primes.
2. **Output hints for `func_2`:** The hints describe the function's behavior accurately concerning returning the nth prime. However, it also notes that it could run indefinitely. This is true, but only if `func_1` had a flaw, which it does not.

### Conclusion
The functions collectively seem to adhere to the problem's requirements. Both functions implement their intended behavior correctly, and there are no edge cases in the description or output hints that indicate any failure of the program to meet its requirements.

Thus, the program follows the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
