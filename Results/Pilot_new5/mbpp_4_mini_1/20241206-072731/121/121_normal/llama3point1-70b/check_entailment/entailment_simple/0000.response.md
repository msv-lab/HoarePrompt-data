To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function must find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Understanding Newman–Shanks–Williams Primes:
The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers that can be defined as follows:
1. The first prime in this sequence is 7.
2. Subsequent primes are found by checking for primality and ensuring they are of the form \(6k \pm 1\).

### Analyzing the Annotated Program:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It correctly handles numbers less than 2 by returning `False`.
   - For numbers 2 and above, it uses trial division up to the square root of `n`, which is a standard method for primality testing. 
   - Therefore, `func_1` will correctly identify whether a number is prime.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.
   - It begins by handling the base case: if `n == 1`, it returns `7`, which is correct as it is the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.
   - It initializes `count` to 1 and `num` to 7, and enters an infinite loop where it checks:
     - If `num` is prime using `func_1`.
     - If `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `count`.
   - When the `count` reaches `n`, it returns `num`.

### Verifying Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime as `7`.
- It utilizes the `func_1` to check for primality properly.
- The condition of being in the form \(6k \pm 1\) is enforced by checking `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.
- The loop continues until the nth prime is found, ensuring that all checks are made for each candidate prime.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number as per the problem description. There are no errors in logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail in correctly identifying these primes.

Correctness: **True**
