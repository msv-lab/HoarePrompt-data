The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is either 0 or 1, it returns 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, the function computes a sequence using a loop where it calculates the next value based on the previous two values (`S0` and `S1`). The final computed value of `S1` after completing the loop is returned. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative since the input is specified to be non-negative. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1; otherwise, it calculates and returns the last value of a sequence based on `n` using a defined recurrence relation. **
