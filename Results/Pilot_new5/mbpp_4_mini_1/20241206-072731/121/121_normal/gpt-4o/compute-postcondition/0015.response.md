The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is either 0 or 1, the function returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the value of S1, which was computed in the last iteration. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 1 if `n` is 0 or 1; otherwise, it returns the value of S1 from the last iteration. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns 1 if n is 0 or 1; otherwise, it returns the value of S1 computed in the last iteration.**
