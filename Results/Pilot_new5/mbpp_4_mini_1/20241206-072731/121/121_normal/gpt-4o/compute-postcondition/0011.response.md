`S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. The previous values are `S1` is 7 and `S0` is 3. Thus, `S_next` becomes `2 * 7 + 3`, which equals 14 + 3, resulting in `S_next` being 17. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**.
