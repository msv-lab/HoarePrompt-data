According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1, which implies that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed at least once. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
