To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The function returns `1` for inputs `0` and `1`, and otherwise, it calculates a sequence based on the recurrence relation.

### Program Review:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1
```

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly returns `1` for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, which aligns with the description.
2. **Recurrence Relation**: The loop computes the values for `S_next` based on the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which seems correctly implemented.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `S1`, which is expected to be the nth value in the series.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and produces `1` for `n = 0` or `1`, otherwise calculating the nth value based on the defined recurrence relation. 

### Edge Cases:
- The function seems to effectively handle `n = 0` and `n = 1`. However, it does not compute the actual Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers but a sequence based on the recurrence relation.
- The sequence generated does not correspond to the actual nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which leads to a significant discrepancy between the expected output (the nth prime) and the actual output (the nth number in the recurrence sequence).

### Conclusion:
The program does not adhere to the problem description, as it does not compute the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers beyond the base cases. Instead, it generates values based on a recurrence relation that does not yield prime numbers as required.

Correctness: **False**. 

The failure arises from the fact that although the initial values are handled correctly, the subsequent calculations do not correspond to the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, hence the function does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case.
