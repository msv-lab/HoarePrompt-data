To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The problem description states that we need to write a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The given program implements a function `func_1(n)` which calculates a series of numbers based on a recursive pattern but does not seem to directly relate to the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229.

Analyzing the function `func_1(n)`:
1. It initializes two terms of a sequence (`S0` and `S1`) both set to 1.
2. It enters a loop from `i = 2` to `n`, calculating the next term in the sequence based on `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.
3. It returns the last computed `S1`.

The first assert statements test the function with specific inputs. However, these values (7, 17, 41) correspond to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th terms of the sequence defined by `func_1`, not the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

### Identifying the issue:
- The program does not actually compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime; it appears to compute terms from a related series instead, which is not the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.
- Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description's requirements.

### Example of failure:
- If you call `func_1(3)`, it returns `7`, which is correct.
- However, if you call `func_1(6)`, it will give you a number based on the calculation but will not correspond to the 6th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, which is `13`.

Given this analysis, the function does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.

Correctness: **False**.
