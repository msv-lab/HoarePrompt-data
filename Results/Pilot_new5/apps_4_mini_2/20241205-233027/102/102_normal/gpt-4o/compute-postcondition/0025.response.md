The function `func_1` accepts three integer inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are guaranteed to be in the range of 1 to 10,000,000. The function attempts to determine if there exist non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true. It does this by iterating through all possible values of `x` (from 0 to `n // a`) and checking if there is a corresponding non-negative integer `y` that satisfies the equation for each `x`. 

If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits the function. If no such pairs are found after checking all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'. 

The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the results. There are no edge cases regarding the input values since `n`, `a`, and `b` are constrained to be positive integers.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, checks for non-negative integer solutions `(x, y)` such that `n = x * a + y * b`, prints 'YES' and the corresponding values if a solution exists, or prints 'NO' if no solution is found. The function does not return any value. **
