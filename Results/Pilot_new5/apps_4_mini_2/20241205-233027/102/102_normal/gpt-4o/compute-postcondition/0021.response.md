Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * `a`, and `x` is 2. If (n - 2 * a) is divisible by `b`, the program indicates 'YES' and prints the tuple (2, (n - 2 * a) // b). Otherwise, there is no explicit return or action taken.***
