Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input: `n` (the total amount of money), `a` (the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). The constraints given in the problem description are respected (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Logic to Find x and y**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over possible values of `x`, the number of bottles of Ber-Cola Vasya can buy. The loop runs from `0` up to `n // a`, which ensures that `x` remains non-negative and does not exceed the maximum number of bottles that can be purchased with `n` burles.

3. **Checking for Valid y**: For each value of `x`, the program calculates the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola, i.e., `n - x * a`. It checks if this remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`). If it can (i.e., `(n - x * a) % b == 0`), then a valid non-negative integer `y` can be computed as `(n - x * a) // b`.

4. **Output**: If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If the loop completes without finding any valid pair, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

5. **Correctness for All Cases**: The approach guarantees that all combinations of `x` and `y` are evaluated within the specified constraints. Since the problem explicitly states that any valid solution should be returned (and not necessarily the unique one), the program meets this requirement as well.

Overall, the logic is sound, and the program effectively covers all scenarios as demanded by the problem description. Thus, it is concluded that the program is correct in fulfilling the task as described.
