Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user and checks if there are non-negative integer solutions `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such pair exists after iterating through possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but communicates results via standard output. **
