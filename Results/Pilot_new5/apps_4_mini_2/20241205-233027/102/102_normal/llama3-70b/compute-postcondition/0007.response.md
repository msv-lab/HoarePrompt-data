The code will print the current values of `x` and `y`. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `n // b`, these are the values that will be printed. The relationship `x * a + y * b = n` holds true based on the initial state, and therefore the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and the relationship `x * a + y * b` is equal to `n` holds true; printed values are `x` = 0 and `y` = `n // b`.**
