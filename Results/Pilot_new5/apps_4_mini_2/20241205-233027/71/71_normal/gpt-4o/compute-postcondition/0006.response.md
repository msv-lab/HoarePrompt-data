The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count_zeros` is 0, so after the code executes, `count_zeros` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be an empty string; `k` is between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 1; `to_remove` is 0; `digit` is the last character of string `n`, and the current value of `digit` is '0'.
