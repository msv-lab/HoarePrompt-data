Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `count_zeros` and `to_remove` retain their respective values based on the conditions outlined in the precondition.***
