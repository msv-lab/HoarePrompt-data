The `print(to_remove)` statement outputs the value of `to_remove`. Since `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and all last `k` digits of `n` are '0' digits, it implies that `to_remove` must be `0` because there are no non-zero digits among the last `k` digits. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is equal to `k`; `to_remove` is 0.**
