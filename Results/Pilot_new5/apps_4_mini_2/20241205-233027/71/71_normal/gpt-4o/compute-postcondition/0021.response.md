`to_remove` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `count_zeros`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is incremented by 1, and `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is incremented by 1, `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.**
