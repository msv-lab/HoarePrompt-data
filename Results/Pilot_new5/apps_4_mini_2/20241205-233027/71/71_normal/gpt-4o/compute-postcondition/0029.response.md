The code `print(len(n) - 1)` calculates the length of the string `n` and subtracts 1 from it. The value of `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000, so its length will be determined based on its character count. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits found in the last `k` digits of `n`, which is less than `k`; the output of the print statement is the length of `n` minus 1.**
