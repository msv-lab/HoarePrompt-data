Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty. If `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is `k + 1`, `to_remove` retains its value, and `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`. Otherwise, `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is incremented by 1, and `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.***
