The operation `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` must not be a multiple of 10, this operation will result in `n` being reduced to a value that is less than its previous value. The previous condition states that `w` is increased by 1, but this variable is not affected by the new assignment to `n`. 

Thus, after executing the code, the states of the variables are updated as follows: `n` is now `n // 10`, and `w` remains increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the result of integer division of the previous `n` by 10; `w` is increased by 1.**
