`w` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged since the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is the input positive integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; `w` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the input non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is the input positive integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; `w` is 0.**
