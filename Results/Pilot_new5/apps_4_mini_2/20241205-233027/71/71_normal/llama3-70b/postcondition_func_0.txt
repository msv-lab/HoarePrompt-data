The function accepts two integers, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `k` (a positive integer), read from input. It counts the number of times `n` can be divided by 10 until `n` becomes divisible by \(10^k\). The function then prints the count of such divisions without returning any value. If `n` starts off as already divisible by \(10^k\), the function will print `0`.
