The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Since `a` was initially a positive integer and will continue to be positive after receiving input, the specific value of `a` will be whatever positive integer is provided as input.

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer**.
