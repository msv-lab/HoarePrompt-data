`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `c` and `a` remain unchanged, but `b` will now hold a positive integer value from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is a positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer.

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is a positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer**.
