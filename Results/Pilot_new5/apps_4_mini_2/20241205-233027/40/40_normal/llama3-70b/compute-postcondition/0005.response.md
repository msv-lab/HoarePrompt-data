The code assigns `substr` the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j`. In the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, which means the substring will consist of the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the value of `substr` will be equal to the first character of the string `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
