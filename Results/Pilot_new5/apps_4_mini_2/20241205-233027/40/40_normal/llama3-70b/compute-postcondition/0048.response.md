To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's structure and the relationships between the variables involved.

We know the following from the initial state and the loop code:
1. `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50.
2. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, representing the length of the string `s`.
3. `max_len` starts at 0 and will be updated based on the condition that checks for non-palindromic substrings.

The outer loop iterates over indices from 0 to `n - 1` (i.e., `n` times), and for each `i`, the inner loop iterates over indices from `i + 1` to `n` (i.e., varying number of times depending on `i`). 

The inner loop constructs substrings `substr` from `s[i:j]` and checks if they are not palindromic. If they are not palindromic, `max_len` is updated to the maximum length found.

At the end of the loop iterations:
- The variable `max_len` will contain the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in the string `s`.
- The loop will always execute for `n` iterations as `n` is at least 1.

Considering these points and the information provided about the output states after particular iterations, we can conclude:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`.**
