According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will run while `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the third character of `s` which is not equal to its reverse.**
