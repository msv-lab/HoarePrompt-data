According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, where `i` is currently 0. This means the loop will execute if `j` starts at 1 (i + 1 = 0 + 1). The loop will continue to execute while `j` is less than or equal to `n` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 50). 

Since `n` is a positive integer, it guarantees that `j` will have a valid iteration. Additionally, `max_len` is currently set to 0, but it does not directly affect the execution of the for loop.

At the start of the loop, the values of `j` will initiate from `1` and can go up to `n`. Hence, there are no adjustments needed for `s`, `max_len`, or `i` to ensure the loop executes properly.

However, we do need to specify the starting value of `j` for clarity. Thus, we need to indicate that `j` will start at 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
