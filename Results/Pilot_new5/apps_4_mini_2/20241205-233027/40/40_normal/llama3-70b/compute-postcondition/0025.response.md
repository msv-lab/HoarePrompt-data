The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the slice `s[i:j]`, which corresponds to the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `substr` will represent the second and third characters of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`.**
