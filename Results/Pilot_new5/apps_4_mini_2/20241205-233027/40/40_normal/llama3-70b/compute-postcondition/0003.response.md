According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, this means the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` must start at 0 when the loop begins. 

The other variables, `s` and `max_len`, do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but since `max_len` is initialized to 0, it implies it will be updated during the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop execution are:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (which is already given),
- `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**.
