Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, while `i` remains 2 and `j` remains 4.***
