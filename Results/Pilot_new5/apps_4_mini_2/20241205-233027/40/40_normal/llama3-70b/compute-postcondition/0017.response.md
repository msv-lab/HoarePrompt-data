To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop structure and the relationships between the variables.

The loop iterates through values of `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n`, generating substrings of `s` from index `i` to `j`. The maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found during these iterations is stored in `max_len`.

After the loop executes for all possible values of `j`, the following relationships hold:

- The variable `max_len` will contain the length of the longest non-palindromic substring that starts at index `i` in the string `s`. 
- Since `n` is the upper limit of the substring, if `n` is equal to the length of `s`, all characters of `s` are considered.
- The value of `i` remains 0 throughout the loop execution, as the loop does not modify `i`.
- The variable `j` will take on values from `1` to `n`.
- The variable `substr` will represent substrings of increasing lengths until the maximum defined by `n`.

If no non-palindromic substrings are found, `max_len` will remain as it was initialized (0).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop, assuming the loop executes for the maximum number of times (i.e., `n` times) and `s` has no palindromic substrings, is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index `i`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `n`.**
