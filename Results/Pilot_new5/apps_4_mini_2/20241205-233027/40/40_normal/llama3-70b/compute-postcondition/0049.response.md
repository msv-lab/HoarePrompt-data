The code checks the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is greater than 0, it prints the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is 0 or less, it prints 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is either a positive integer (outputting its value) or 0 (outputting 0).**
