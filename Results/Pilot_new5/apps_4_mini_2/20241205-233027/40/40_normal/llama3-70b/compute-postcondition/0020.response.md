`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which means it will be a substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to, but not including, index `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `substr` will be the second character of the string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index `i`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `substr` is the second character of `s`.**
