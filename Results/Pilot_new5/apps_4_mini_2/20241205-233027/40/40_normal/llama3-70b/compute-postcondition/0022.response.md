The code assigns the value of `max_len` to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is the second character of `s`, the length of `substr` is 1. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to either its current value or 1, depending on which is larger. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the current value of `substr` is the second character of `s`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).**
