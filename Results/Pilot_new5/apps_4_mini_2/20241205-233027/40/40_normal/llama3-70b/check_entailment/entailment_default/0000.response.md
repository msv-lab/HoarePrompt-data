To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem description recap:
1. We need to find the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome.
2. If no such substring exists, return 0.

### Code analysis:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:  # Check if the substring is not a palindrome
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)
```

### Output hints analysis:
- The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring. It prints this length, returning 0 if all substrings are palindromic.

### Edge cases and potential issues:
1. **Single character strings**: Any string of length 1 (e.g., "a") will only contain palindromic substrings. Hence, the output should be 0, which is correctly accounted for since there are no non-palindromic substrings.
  
2. **Strings with all identical characters**: For instance, "aaaa". All possible substrings are palindromic. The code should return 0, which it does by checking all substrings.

3. **Strings that are not palindromes**: For example, "mew" should return 3 since it is itself not a palindrome. The code correctly identifies the entire string.

4. **Long substrings that can be derived**: For a string like "wuffuw", the longest non-palindromic substring would be "uffuw" or "wuffu", both of length 5. The code appears to find the correct maximum substring length.

### Issues:
The code exhaustively checks every possible substring, which is correct in logic, but it might not be the most efficient way to handle the problem when considering edge cases with the maximum length of 50 characters. However, since the problem does not state anything about efficiency, the correctness of outputs is what matters.

### Final assessment:
After considering the given description, the code correctly identifies the length of the longest non-palindromic substring and handles edge cases (single characters, identical characters, etc.) properly.

The output hints also align with the functionality of the code, confirming that it follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function checks all substrings of `s` to find the longest one that is not a palindrome and correctly returns 0 if no such substring exists. The implementation handles edge cases appropriately, ensuring it meets the requirements of the problem statement.
