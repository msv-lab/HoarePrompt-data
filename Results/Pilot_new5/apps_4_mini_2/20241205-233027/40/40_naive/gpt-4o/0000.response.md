To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem description states that we need to find the maximum length of a substring from a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, we should return `0`.

The program first checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to `1`. If so, it immediately prints `0`, which is correct since a single character is always a palindrome.

Next, the program checks if the whole string `s` is not a palindrome using the function `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s`, which is correct because the whole string is the longest non-palindrome substring.

Then, it checks if the substring `s[1:]` (which is the string minus its first character) is not a palindrome. If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints its length (`len(s) - 1`). This is also correct as it identifies that removing the first character still results in a non-palindrome.

Next, it checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (the string minus its last character) is not a palindrome. If this substring is also not a palindrome, it prints its length (`len(s) - 1`), which is again correct.

Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, it prints `0`, indicating that all substrings are palindromes.

However, there is a logical flaw in how it checks for the longest non-palindrome substring. Specifically:
- For the string "aabba", the whole string is a palindrome, but the substring "aab" and "abb" are not palindromes, and their lengths should be considered. The current program only checks the whole string and its edges, potentially missing valid non-palindrome substrings in between.

Thus, the program fails to identify and return the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings in certain cases.

For example:
- Input: "aabba"
- The output should be `3` because "aab" (or "abb") is a valid non-palindrome substring of length 3. However, the program would output `0` because it only checks the edges and finds the whole string is a palindrome.

Due to this flaw in logic and handling of edge cases, the program does not conform to the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
