According to the code, the for loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`. The loop can execute again if the current value of `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 10
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 3

First, we need to calculate the upper bound for `b`:
- The maximum value for `b` is `(n - a) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 2) // 2`.

Given that `n` is at least 10, we can find:
- If `n` is 10, then `(n - 2) // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4`.
- If `n` is greater than 10, `(n - 2) // 2` will also increase accordingly.

Since `b` is currently 3, it can take the value of 4 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 to 4.

Thus, the new state will be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10; `a` is 2; `b` is 4; `ways` remains unchanged**.
