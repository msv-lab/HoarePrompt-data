The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The previous value of `ways` is 0, so the new value of `ways` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `ways` is now 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, the ending value for `b` is at least 2, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2 times the sum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, the ending value for `b` is at least 2, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2 times the sum of `a` and `b`.**
