According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. The execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `a` is currently 1 because that's the starting point of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must increment by 1. The next value of `a` will thus be 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, the upper limit of the range, which is `n // 2 + 1`, must be greater than 2. This means that `n` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to execute once more.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ways` is the number of pairs (1, b), `a` is 2, `b` will be in the range [1, (n - 1) // 2]**
