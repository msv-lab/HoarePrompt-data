`ways` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0**.
