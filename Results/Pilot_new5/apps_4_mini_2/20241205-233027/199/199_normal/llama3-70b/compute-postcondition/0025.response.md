According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`, which is iterating over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. The range for `a` would be from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`, which means that for `n` being at least 4, the maximum value for `a` is at least 3 (since `n // 2` is at least 2).

Since `a` is currently 2, the next value of `a` will be incremented to 3. The loop will execute again for `a` equal to 3. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` should be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is 3, `b` is in the range [2, (n - 1) // 2], `ways` is the count of valid pairs (1, b) such that `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) = n;`**
