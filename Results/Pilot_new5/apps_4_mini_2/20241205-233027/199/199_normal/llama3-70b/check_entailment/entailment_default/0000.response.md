To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we first analyze the problem requirements and then evaluate the code implementation.

### Problem Description:

Pasha wants to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. Each part has a positive integer length.
2. The sum of the parts equals `n`.
3. The lengths can form a rectangle, which requires two distinct pairs of equal lengths (i.e., pairs like `{a, a, b, b}`).
4. It must not form a square, which would require all four parts to be equal (i.e., `{x, x, x, x}`).

### Code Analysis:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

1. **Iterate for `a`:** The outer loop varies `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
2. **Iterate for `b`:** The inner loop varies `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
3. **Condition Check:** The condition checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`. This checks if the total length of the stick can split into two pairs of lengths `a` and `b`.

### Edge Cases:

1. **Even vs. Odd Lengths:**
   - If `n` is odd, `n/2` is not an integer, and since we need pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n/2`, the function will not find valid pairs and will return `0`. This aligns with the requirement that the sum must be an integer.
   - Specifically, if `n = 5`, the function will return `0`, which is correct as no valid pairs exist.

2. **Minimum Valid Input:**
   - For `n = 4`, the possible parts can only be `{1, 1, 1, 1}` which forms a square. Thus the program should return `0`, which it does correctly.

3. **Valid Cases:**
   - For even `n`, the program correctly identifies valid pairs as shown in the examples given (e.g., `n = 20` produces `4` valid combinations).

### Output Hints:

The output hints suggest that the function:
- Returns valid pairs for even `n`.
- Returns `0` for odd `n`, confirming that the logic aligns with the function's checks and the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program implements the logic as described in the problem statement. However, it does not account for the checks needed to ensure that the pairs `(a, b)` must not lead to a square formation under all conditions where `n` allows forming a rectangle. Specifically:
- The code does correctly avoid counting the square case by ensuring `a != b`, but it could still fail to check combinations properly if `n` can allow configurations like `{x, x, y, y}` where additional checks might be necessary.

Since the program does not explicitly cover all described requirements without potentially failing for certain edge cases due to lack of checks for square formation based solely on `a != b`, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not ensure that configurations leading to squares do not slip through the filter; hence it cannot be considered fully correct.
