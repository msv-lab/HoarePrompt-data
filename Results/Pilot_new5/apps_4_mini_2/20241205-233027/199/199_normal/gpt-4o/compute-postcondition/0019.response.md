The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. Since the initial state indicates `a` is 3, the new value of `b` will also be 3. The other variables `n`, `count`, and `rem` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 12, `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `rem` is equal to `n - 8` if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even; if `rem` is not greater than 0 or not even, the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 12, `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `rem` is equal to `n - 8` if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even; if `rem` is not greater than 0 or not even, the values remain unchanged.**
