To determine the correctness of the annotated program, we need to analyze how well it adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description.

The problem requires counting the number of distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four positive integer parts such that those parts can form a rectangle but not a square. The valid configurations for forming a rectangle (but not a square) can be represented as pairs of lengths, where we have two lengths `x` and `y`, specifically organized as `{x, x, y, y}`. 

### Analyzing the Annotated Program:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - The program first checks if `n` is less than 6. If so, it returns 0, which is correct since it's impossible to form four positive integer lengths summing to less than 6.

2. **Counting Valid Combinations**:
   - It uses a loop where `a` ranges from `1` to `n // 4`. It sets `b` to `a`, meaning pairs of lengths are being calculated.
   - The remainder `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, which simplifies to `n - 4 * a`. The loop checks if `rem` is positive and even.
   - If `rem` is positive and even, it computes `rem // 2` and ensures that `a` does not equal `rem // 2` to avoid forming a square (i.e., {x, x, x, x}).

3. **Count Increment**: 
   - For each valid configuration, it increments the count, which represents the number of ways to form a rectangle without forming a square.

### Edge Cases and Requirements:

- The program correctly captures all configurations where the rectangle condition is met (two pairs) and avoids the square condition.
- The loop correctly iterates up to `n // 4`, ensuring that the values of `a` and `b` are constrained appropriately to form valid lengths.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the number of valid splits of the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. It handles the necessary conditions and constraints set forth in the problem description.

Thus, the overall correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **True**
