To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we analyze the code and the provided output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. Each part has a positive integer length.
2. The lengths can form a rectangle but not a square.

For lengths to form a rectangle, we can express them as two pairs of equal lengths (e.g., `{a, a, b, b}`), while not allowing all parts to be equal (which would form a square).

### Code Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```
1. **Initial Check**: The function returns `0` if `n < 6`, which is correct because it's impossible to split a stick of length less than 6 into four positive lengths.
2. **Iterating through Possible Values**: The loop ranges from `1` to `n // 4 + 1`, which seems to cover the potential values for `a`.
3. **Remaining Length Calculation**: The variable `rem` represents the remaining length after accounting for two parts of length `a` and two parts of length `b` (which is also `a` in this case), i.e., `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`.
4. **Conditions for Valid Pairs**: The code checks if `rem` is positive and even, which is necessary for it to be split into two equal lengths `rem // 2`. Additionally, it checks that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, ensuring that we do not inadvertently form a square.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints specify that the function calculates valid pairs `(a, b)` under the same conditions as described above.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Minimum Length (6)**: The case for `n = 6` should return `1` since `{1, 1, 2, 2}` is a valid configuration. The code appears to handle this correctly.
2. **General Cases**: For `n = 20`, the valid pairs `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}` are correctly counted, resulting in `4`.

### Possible Missing Cases:
- The current logic assumes that `b` is always equal to `a`. It doesn't consider the possibility of different lengths for `a` and `b` (like `{1, 2, 2, 1}`), which may also generate valid configurations. This could lead to incorrect counts for larger values of `n`.

After analyzing both the problem description and the output hints along with the edge cases, we can see that the code does not fully implement the requirements of the problem, as it restricts `b` to always be equal to `a`. This is a significant oversight because it limits the possible configurations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly account for alternative configurations of the parts that could result in valid setups for rectangles but not squares.
