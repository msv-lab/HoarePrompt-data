The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, which indicates that the value of `ans` will increase by 1 from its previous value. The other variables `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, and `ans` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
