The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200000. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, and both lists `p` and `b` have a length of `n`. 

After executing the function, the output is determined based on the contents of these parameters. The exact nature of the return value will depend on the implementation details, which are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list `p` that is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones, and to return a result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
