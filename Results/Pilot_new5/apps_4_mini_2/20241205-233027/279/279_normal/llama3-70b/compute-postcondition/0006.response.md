The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so after the operation, `ans` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` implies that there is a discrepancy at index `i`, which justifies the increment of `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` while retaining the information about the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1**
