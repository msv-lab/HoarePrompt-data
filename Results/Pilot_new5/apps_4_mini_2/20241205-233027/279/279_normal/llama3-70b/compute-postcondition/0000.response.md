The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000 as per the initial state. Other variables (`p` and `b`) are not affected by this code, so they retain their original values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, both lists having a length of `n`.**
