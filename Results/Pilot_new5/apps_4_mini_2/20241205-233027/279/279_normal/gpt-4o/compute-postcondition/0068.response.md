Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values, `cycles` contains all cycles found during the iterations, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of `1` for each cycle where all `b[x] == 0` for `x` in that cycle. If there is exactly one cycle in `cycles`, the value `0` has been printed. If there are multiple cycles, it outputs the value of `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it outputs `1`.***
