To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
Vasya needs to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
2. \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - It checks if \(n \times m \% k \neq 0\), which implies that \(nm\) cannot be evenly divided by \(k\). If true, it prints "NO".

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The function `func_3(a, b)` is called to calculate values based on the inputs. This function utilizes the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integer coefficients related to \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, where \(g\) is derived from `func_3(n, m)`. If this condition is satisfied, it proceeds to print "YES" and the calculated points. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area is defined as \(\frac{nm}{k}\). If \(k\) is larger than the product \(nm\), the required area becomes less than 1, which would not be possible given the constraints. The program does not account for this situation directly.

2. **Point Calculation Logic**:
   - The check `abs(n1 * m) >= g` may not always provide valid points that satisfy the triangle area requirement. The program relies on calculated values from the Euclidean algorithm to determine valid coordinates, which could potentially lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not yield points that form a valid triangle.

### Test Cases:
- Consider the case when \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\):
  - Here, \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\). This is a non-integer area which is not allowed, yet the output would be "NO", which seems correct, but let's further analyze.
  
- Another case to consider is \(n = 10\), \(m = 10\), \(k = 20\):
  - Here, \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{100}{20} = 5\). The program might fail to find valid coordinates even if the area is achievable under the integer constraints since the logic in `func_3` and checks may not align correctly with the triangle area condition.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to have logic flaws in ensuring that the calculated integer points not only satisfy the area condition but also remain within the bounds defined by \(n\) and \(m\). Since there are potential cases where the criteria for valid points may not be met, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.

Correctness: **False**.
