To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and check if it covers all possible edge cases according to the problem description.

1. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if it is an integer. If it's not an integer, it prints "NO".

2. **Area Adjustment**: If the calculated area is 0, it also prints "NO". However, the area can only be 0 if either `n` or `m` is 0, which contradicts the constraints (`1 â‰¤ n, m`).

3. **Coordinates Generation**:
   - If `2 * area <= n`, it generates points `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.
   - If `2 * area <= m`, it generates points `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it generates points based on the maximum values of `n` and `m`.

### Problematic Cases:
1. **Triangle Area Calculation**: The area of a triangle given by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]
   The generated points must form a triangle with the area equal to `nm/k`, but the program does not validate this condition explicitly.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not check if the generated points actually fall within the allowed bounds \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\). For instance, if `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 2`, the computed area is `0.5`, and the program might attempt to generate points that don't actually form a valid triangle.

3. **Output for Cases where No Valid Triangle Exists**: There are cases where it can print "YES" but actually generates points that do not form the required area.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
n = 2, m = 2, k = 5
```
Calculating the area:
\[
\text{area} = \frac{2 \cdot 2}{5} = 0.8
\]
Since the area is not an integer, the program will correctly output "NO".

However, consider:
```
n = 2, m = 2, k = 1
```
The area will be:
\[
\text{area} = \frac{2 \cdot 2}{1} = 4
\]
This is valid, but the points `(0, 0)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` would be generated, yielding an area calculation (using the triangle area formula mentioned above) that does not correspond to the expected value of 4.

Thus, the program has logical flaws and does not handle all potential edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
