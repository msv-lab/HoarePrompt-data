#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a` since `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, it will return `a`, which is correct since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. The function handles any positive integers, and there are no missing edge cases in the logic provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b is non-negative.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the values 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple containing y and x - a // b * y, where x and y are the output of func_2(b, a % b), and b is non-negative and greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (where `b` is a non-negative integer). It implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to return a tuple. If `b` is zero, it returns (1, 0). If `b` is greater than zero, it recursively calls itself with the parameters `b` and `a % b`, and then returns a tuple consisting of `y` and `x - a // b * y`. This function essentially computes the coefficients of the equation `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where a represents the variable 'n' and b represents the variable 'm' from the problem description.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x, y from func_2(a, b), and the result of the expression x * a + y * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain values `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. It assumes that `func_2` will always return valid integers for `x` and `y`. No error handling or checks for potential issues with the output of `func_2` are included.
