To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code logic, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
Vasya is looking for three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area calculated as \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The program should:
1. Print "NO" if no such points can be found.
2. Print "YES" and provide the coordinates of the points if they can be found.

### Code Analysis:
1. The code reads the input values \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
2. It calculates the area \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \) and checks if this area is a positive integer.
3. If the area is not an integer or is zero, it prints "NO".
4. If the area is valid, it prints "YES" and attempts to determine the coordinates of the points based on the condition of \( 2 \times \text{area} \):
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \): It defines two points based on \( x \).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \): It defines two points based on \( y \).
   - If neither condition holds, it provides a fallback based on the limits of \( n \) and \( m \).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest that the function correctly assesses the area and outputs possible coordinates based on the conditions provided. It mentions:
- The function checks if the area is positive and an integer.
- It provides specific coordinates based on the conditions set forth.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Zero Area or Non-integer Area**: The code correctly handles cases where the area is zero or not an integer, returning "NO".
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not check if the computed coordinates are within the valid range of \( (0 \leq x_i \leq n) \) and \( (0 \leq y_i \leq m) \). Specifically, the conditions for printing points based on \( 2 \times \text{area} \) should ensure that the computed points do not exceed the limits defined by \( n \) and \( m \).

### Example Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider:
- Input: \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), \( k = 2 \)
- The area should equal \( \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6 \), which is valid.
- However, \( 2 \times \text{area} = 12 \) exceeds both \( n \) and \( m \). The function will not handle this case correctly and will attempt to return coordinates exceeding the valid range.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly those where the computed coordinates exceed the valid bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \). Thus, it does not fully comply with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
