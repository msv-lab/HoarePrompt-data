The code prints the string '1 0', which does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. Therefore, all variables remain unchanged. The output consists of the printed string, but it does not affect the state variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`.**
