The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are integers. Before the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `k` were integers within the ranges specified (1 to 10^9 for `n` and `m`, and 2 to 10^9 for `k`). After the code execution, their values will change based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from input, where `n`, `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9.**
