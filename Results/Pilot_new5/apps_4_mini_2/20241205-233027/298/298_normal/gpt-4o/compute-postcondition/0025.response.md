The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided definition. However, it is stated that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with constraints such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. As there is no output provided in the sample, we cannot determine any specific return values or conditions based on input values. Therefore, without further details on the output or behavior of `func`, we cannot accurately describe its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has no specified output.**
