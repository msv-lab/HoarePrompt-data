The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO', which does not change the values of any variables, but indicates that the area calculation is not valid or does not meet certain conditions. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged, and `area` is still equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State includes all the initial conditions that are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` remains an integer. The current value of `area` is 0.**
