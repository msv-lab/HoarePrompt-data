Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within their specified limits. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' is printed. If `area` equals 0, then `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is within bounds for `m`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`.***
