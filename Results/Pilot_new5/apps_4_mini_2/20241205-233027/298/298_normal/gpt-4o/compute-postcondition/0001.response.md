The variable `area` is assigned the value of `n * m / k`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`, the value of `area` will be a floating-point number that results from the multiplication of `n` and `m`, divided by `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k.**
