Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within their specified ranges. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the printed output is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the printed output is `0 {m // 2}`.***
