The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of any variables. The initial conditions remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, and `area` is not equal to 0.**
