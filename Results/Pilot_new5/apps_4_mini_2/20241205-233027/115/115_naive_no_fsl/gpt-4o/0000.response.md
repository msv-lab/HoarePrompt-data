To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given two matrices \(A\) and \(B\). Matrix \(A\) is populated with \(0\)s and \(1\)s, while \(B\) starts as a matrix of all \(0\)s.
2. Our goal is to transform \(B\) into \(A\) using operations that fill a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix of \(B\) with \(1\)s.
3. If it's impossible to make \(B\) equal to \(A\), the program should return \(-1\).
4. If it is possible, it should return the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The program first reads the input and constructs matrix \(A\).
- It initializes an operations list and matrix \(B\).
- The nested loops iterate through all potential \(2 \times 2\) submatrices in \(A\). 
- If a \(2 \times 2\) block of \(1\)s is found, it marks the corresponding positions in \(B\) as \(1\) and records the operation.
- Finally, it checks if \(B\) matches \(A\). If they differ, it returns \(-1\); otherwise, it outputs the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Potential Issues:
The program correctly identifies \(2 \times 2\) blocks of \(1\)s in \(A\) and updates \(B\) accordingly. However, it fails in the following scenarios:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not consider cases where \(A\) has \(1\)s that cannot be covered by \(2 \times 2\) blocks. For instance, if \(A\) contains isolated \(1\)s (e.g., a \(1\) at position \((1, 1)\) in a \(3 \times 3\) matrix), the program will mark \(B\) with \(1\)s only where \(2 \times 2\) blocks can be placed. Thus, if there's a \(1\) in \(A\) that is not part of any \(2 \times 2\) block, \(B\) will not be able to match \(A\), leading to an incorrect \(-1\) return.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not handle cases where isolated \(1\)s exist in matrix \(A\) that can't be reached by the defined operations. Therefore, it fails to adhere to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
