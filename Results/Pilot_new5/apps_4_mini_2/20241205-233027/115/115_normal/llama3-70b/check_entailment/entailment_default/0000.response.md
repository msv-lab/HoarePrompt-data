To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, I will first analyze the code and then see if there are any edge cases or discrepancies.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check whether we can make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing operations on B. Each operation allows us to fill a 2x2 submatrix of B with ones, and the output should either be a list of operations or -1 if it's impossible.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The code reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix A itself.
2. It initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations.
3. A nested loop checks every possible 2x2 submatrix:
   - If all four positions contain 1s, it continues to the next iteration.
   - If any one of the four positions contains a 1, it adds the top-left position of that 2x2 submatrix to `ops`.
4. At the end, if the number of operations exceeds 2500, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Missing Check for Zeroes**: The program does not account for cases where it might be impossible to generate the desired matrix B from A. Specifically, if there are isolated 1s in A that cannot be covered by any 2x2 operations, the code will still add them to `ops`, leading to incorrect results.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The logic of the program allows for operations to be added even if the required conditions for forming matrix A are not met. For instance, if A has a 1 that is not part of any 2x2 block, the program would miss this condition and could output an invalid series of operations.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function checks for the presence of at least one 1 in each 2x2 submatrix. If there is even one 1, it logs the top-left coordinates. This does not align with the requirement of making matrix B equal to A, because it does not ensure that all required 1s in A can be covered appropriately by operations on B.

### Conclusion:
Given the code's logic and the discrepancies highlighted, particularly how it can incorrectly register operations for 1s that cannot be covered (i.e., isolated 1s in A), I conclude that the program does not meet the problem description correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following matrix A:
```
1 0
0 0
```
In this case, the program would add operations for the 1 at position (0,0), even though it cannot cover this position with a 2x2 operation. Hence, the output will be misleading and incorrect.
