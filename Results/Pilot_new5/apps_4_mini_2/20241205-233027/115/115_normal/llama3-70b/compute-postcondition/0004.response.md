To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided variables and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`, which means `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at all. If `m` is 1 or less, the range will be invalid, and the loop will not enter.

2. The state before the loop starts indicates that `A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `ops` is an empty list. However, these states do not affect whether the loop can execute directly.

3. The focus is on the variable `m` since it dictates the number of iterations. Since the loop depends on `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is strictly greater than 1.

Based on these considerations, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

- `m` must be greater than 1 to create a valid range for `j`.

At the start of the loop:
- `j` will begin at `0`.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary states:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `ops` is an empty list, `j` is 0**.
