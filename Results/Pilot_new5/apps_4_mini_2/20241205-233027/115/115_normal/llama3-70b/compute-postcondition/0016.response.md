To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the for loop and its conditions. 

The loop iterates over the variable `j` in the range of `m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, we need to check if it can be incremented for the next iteration. 

Given that `m` is greater than 2:
- The current value of `j` is 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. This means `j` can take values starting from 0 up to `m - 2`. 

Since `m` is greater than 2, then `m - 1` is at least 2. Thus, the next iteration will occur when `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` will become 2 for the next iteration.
- `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` need to be checked based on the new value of `j` (which will be 2). 

For the loop to execute again:
- `j` should be 2, and we need to ensure that the indices used to access the elements of `A` are within the bounds of the 2D list. Since `m` is greater than 2, `A` should have at least 3 columns, allowing `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` to be valid.

The conditions state that at least one of the accessed elements should be 1 for the loop iteration to continue.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` must be 1.**
