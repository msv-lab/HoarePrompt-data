The variable `A` is assigned a new value based on user input through a list comprehension. The code creates a 2D list of integers, where each row is populated by mapping the input split by spaces into integers for `n` rows. The dimensions of the list are determined by the previously defined integers `n` and `m`, which are guaranteed to be between 2 and 50. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is an integer from user input, `m` is an integer from user input, and `A` has shape `n x m`.**
