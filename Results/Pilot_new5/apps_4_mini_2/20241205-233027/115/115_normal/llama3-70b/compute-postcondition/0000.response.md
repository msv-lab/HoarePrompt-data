The code snippet involves taking input for the values of `n` and `m` as integers. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers constrained between 2 and 50, and does not define specific values for them yet. The operation `map(int, input().split())` will read a line of input, split it into separate strings, convert those strings to integers, and store them back into `n` and `m`.

Since `n` and `m` are integers and the input will assign them new integer values based on user input, we can infer the following:

- After running the code, `n` and `m` will now hold the values entered by the user, but since those specific values will come from user input during execution, they cannot be predetermined. 

Thus, the output state will still reflect that the ranges for `n` and `m` are valid (between 2 and 50) but will now include the fact that they are assigned new integer values.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` and `m` are integers assigned new values from user input such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50.**
