The `continue` statement is encountered, which skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but it indicates that the loop will move on without executing any subsequent code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is now 0, and the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
