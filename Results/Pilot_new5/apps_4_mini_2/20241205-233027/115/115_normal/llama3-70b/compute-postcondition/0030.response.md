According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1 and `m` must still be greater than 1, allowing for at least one more iteration.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is 1**
