Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, and `j` is now `m - 1`. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the loop continues in the current iteration.***
