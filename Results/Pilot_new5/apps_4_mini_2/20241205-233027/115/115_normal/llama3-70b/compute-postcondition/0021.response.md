Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating the positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is `m - 1`. If none of the elements at positions `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are equal to 1, then `ops` remains empty.**
