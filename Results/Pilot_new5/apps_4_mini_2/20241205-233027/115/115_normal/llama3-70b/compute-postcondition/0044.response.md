The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no additional information about what the loop entails or what variables may be affected, the output state will reflect that we are continuing in the current loop with unchanged variables.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is now `m - 1`, and we continue in the current loop iteration.**
