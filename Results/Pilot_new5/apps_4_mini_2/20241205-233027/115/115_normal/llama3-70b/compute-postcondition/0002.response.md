The variable `ops` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `A`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged since no operations modify them. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `ops` has been initialized while maintaining the existing states of `A`, `n`, and `m`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is an integer from user input, `m` is an integer from user input, and `ops` is an empty list.**
