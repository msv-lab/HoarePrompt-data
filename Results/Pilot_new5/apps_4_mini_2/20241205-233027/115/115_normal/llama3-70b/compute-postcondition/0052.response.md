The code appends a new tuple to the `ops` list. The tuple consists of the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is equal to `m`, which is greater than or equal to 3, we can determine the specific values being appended. The value of `i + 1` is 3, and the value of `j + 1` is `m + 1`.

The initial conditions specify that `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, but this does not affect the output state directly since the code only modifies the `ops` variable.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `ops` list, including the new tuple.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `ops` contains the additional tuple `(3, m + 1)`, and `j` is now `m`.**
