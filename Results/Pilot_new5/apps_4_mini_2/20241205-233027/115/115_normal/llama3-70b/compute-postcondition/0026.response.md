Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, `j` is now 0, and if the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, there is no action taken.***
