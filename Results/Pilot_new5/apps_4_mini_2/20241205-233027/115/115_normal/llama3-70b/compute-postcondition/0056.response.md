Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `ops` contains the additional tuple `(3, m + 1)`, `j` is 3. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
