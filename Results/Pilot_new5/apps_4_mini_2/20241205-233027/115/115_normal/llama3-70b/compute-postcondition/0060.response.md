Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating all unique positions `(i + 1, j + 1)` in `A` for which at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, ensuring no duplicates in `ops`. If there are no such positions, `ops` remains empty.**
