The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(3, m)`, and `j` is now `m`.**
