The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes to the variables due to this statement, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
