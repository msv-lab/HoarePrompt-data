Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[2][2]`, `B[2][3]`, `B[3][2]`, and `B[3][3]` are updated to 1, and `operations` includes tuples (2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 3). Otherwise, no changes are made in the else part, which is absent.***
