The code assigns the value of `1` to four specific positions in the 2D list `B`. The variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `A` remain unchanged, but `B` is updated at four indices.

The relevant changes are:
- `B[i][j]` is updated to `1`
- `B[i][j + 1]` is updated to `1`
- `B[i + 1][j]` is updated to `1`
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is updated to `1`

Given the initial state of `A` and the specified indices, we know that these positions in `B` are now set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1.**
