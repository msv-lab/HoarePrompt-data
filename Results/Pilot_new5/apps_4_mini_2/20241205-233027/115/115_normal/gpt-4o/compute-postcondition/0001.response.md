The code snippet creates a new 2D list `B` that has the same dimensions as `A` (n x m), where every element in `B` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `operations` is still empty. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions n x m; `operations` is an empty list; `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where every element is 0.**
