The statement assigns the value `1` to a specific set of indices in the 2D list `B`. Given that `i` is `1` and `j` is at least `0` and less than `m - 2`, the indices that will be updated are:

- `B[1][j]`
- `B[1][j + 1]`
- `B[2][j]`
- `B[2][j + 1]`

Since `n` is at least `3`, `B[2][j]` and `B[2][j + 1]` are valid indices. The specific values of `j` are not known, but we are assured that they fall within the bounds.

The `A` variable remains unchanged as the operation only modifies `B`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` has `B[1][j] = 1`, `B[1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[2][j] = 1`, `B[2][j + 1] = 1`, `j` is at least 0 and less than `m - 2`.**
