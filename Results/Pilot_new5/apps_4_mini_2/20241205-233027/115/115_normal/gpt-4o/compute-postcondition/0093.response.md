The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. The parameter `n` is an integer that represents the number of rows, `m` is an integer that represents the number of columns, and `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where each element is either 0 or 1. The function has multiple cases that all return -1, indicating various conditions of mismatch or errors related to the input values of `A`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A`, and return -1 under various conditions involving mismatches or errors with the values in `A`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), m (integer), and A (2D list of integers), and returns -1 under various conditions indicating mismatches or errors related to the values in A.**
