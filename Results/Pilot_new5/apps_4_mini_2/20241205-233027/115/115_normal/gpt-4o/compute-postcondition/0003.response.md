According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `m`. The loop runs for `j` in the range of `m - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m - 1` must be at least 1, which means `m` must be at least 2. Since the provided state states that `m` is between 2 and 50, this condition is satisfied, ensuring that the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop, the variable `j` will take on the value 0 during the first iteration, so we set `j` to 0.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `n` is at least 2 (as provided),
- `m` is between 2 and 50 (as provided),
- `i` is 0 (as provided),
- `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) (as provided),
- `operations` is an empty list (as provided),
- `B` is a 2D list of integers (0) with dimensions n x m (as provided),
- `j` is 0 (as it will be the value during the first iteration).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers (0) with dimensions n x m, `j` is 0**
