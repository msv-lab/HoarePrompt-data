The variable `mex` is increased by 1. The initial state indicates that `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, which implies that the new value of `mex` will still be less than or equal to `num` after the increment. Other variables (`n`, `a`, `num`, and the loop index) remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is the first element in `a`, `num` is greater than or equal to `mex + 1`, and the index for the loop is 0.**
