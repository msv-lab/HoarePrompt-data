According to the code, the loop executes for each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must move to the next element in the list. Since `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `num` will be updated to the second element in the list after the current iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `num` will be the second element of `a`, and `num` must be a positive integer meeting the condition of being at least `mex + 1` if the previous condition was met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is the second element in `a`.**
