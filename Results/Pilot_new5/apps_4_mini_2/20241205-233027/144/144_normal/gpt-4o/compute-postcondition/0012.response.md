The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, but the initial conditions state that `mex` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `mex` has been modified. The values of `n`, `a`, and `num` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in `a`; `mex` is incremented by 1.**
