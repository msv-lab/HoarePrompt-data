The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It computes and prints the smallest positive integer (mex) that is not present in the list `a`. The mex is defined as the smallest integer greater than the maximum element in `a` if all integers from 1 to that integer are present in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
