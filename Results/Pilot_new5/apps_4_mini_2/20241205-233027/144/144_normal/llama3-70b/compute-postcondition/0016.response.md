Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element than `num`, which is the next integer in `arr`. If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
