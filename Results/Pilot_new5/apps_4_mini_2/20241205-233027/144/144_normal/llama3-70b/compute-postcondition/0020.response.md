Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element than the current `num`; if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, implying that no changes are made to `mex`.***
