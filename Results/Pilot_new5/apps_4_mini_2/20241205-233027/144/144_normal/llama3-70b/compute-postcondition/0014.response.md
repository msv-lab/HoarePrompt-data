The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers that must have at least one more element than the current `num`, and `num` must be the next integer in the sorted list `arr`.
