To determine if the provided Python program correctly computes the maximum possible value of mex for the given problem, let's analyze the logic of the code alongside the problem description.

The code works as follows:

1. It reads the integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array.
2. It reads the array `arr` containing `n` positive integers.
3. It sorts the array `arr`.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which will be incremented for each occurrence of `mex` found in the array.
5. It iterates through each number in the sorted array:
   - If the current number equals `mex`, it increments `mex`.
   - If the current number is greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop (since further numbers will also be greater given the sort order).
6. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

### Analysis of the Code

The logic in the code aims to find the smallest positive integer not present in the modified array. However, it does not consider the fact that we can decrease elements in the original array to fill in gaps in the series from 1 to `n`. 

Let's examine cases where the logic may fail:

#### Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 2 4 5
```

In this case:
- The sorted array `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]`.
- The program will correctly identify that `1` and `2` are present, and when it reaches `3`, it will increment `mex` to `3`.
- The number `4` is greater than `3`, so it will break the loop.
- The output will be `3`, which is correct.

However, now consider another case:
#### Consider the input:
```
3
5 6 7
```

- The sorted array becomes `[5, 6, 7]`.
- The program will initialize `mex` as `1` and will find that `1` is not present, thus it will not increment it.
- The output will be `1`, which is incorrect because Alyona has the option of decreasing any of the elements to make `1` appear in the array. The correct maximum mex after operations would be `4` (since she can decrease `5` to `1`, `6` to `2`, and `7` to `3`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for the ability to decrease elements in the array to fill in missing numbers. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the smallest integers are not present in the original array.

Correctness: **False**
