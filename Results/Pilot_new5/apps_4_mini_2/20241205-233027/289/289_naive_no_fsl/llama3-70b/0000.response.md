Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament by using the expression `n.bit_length() - 1`. However, this approach is incorrect because the maximum number of games a single player can play is not directly related to the bit length of the number of players.

To illustrate a case where the program does not work correctly, consider the following example:
- For `n = 7` (7 players), the expected output should be `3`. A possible pairing could be:
  - Round 1: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), (5 vs 6) -> Winners: 1, 3, 5
  - Round 2: (1 vs 3), (5 vs 7) (assuming 7 is also playing) -> Winner: 1
  - Total games played by the winner (player 1): 3.
  
However, when running the program with `n = 7`, it calculates `7.bit_length() - 1` which returns `2`, incorrectly suggesting that the winner can play a maximum of 2 games, which contradicts the expected result.

Thus, the program fails to provide the correct output for at least one input case, making it incorrect.
