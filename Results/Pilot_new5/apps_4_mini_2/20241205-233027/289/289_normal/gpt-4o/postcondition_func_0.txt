The function reads an integer `n` from user input, which represents the number of players in a tournament (with constraints of 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). It calculates and prints the maximum number of games that can be played in a tournament format based on `n`, which is determined using the bit length of `n` minus 1. The function does not return any value.
