`max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer `n` in binary, which effectively gives us the position of the highest set bit in `n`. Since `n` is constrained to be between 2 and \(10^{18}\), `max_games` will take a specific value based on the binary representation of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
