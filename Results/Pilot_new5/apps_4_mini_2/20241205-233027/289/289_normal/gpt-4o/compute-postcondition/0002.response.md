The value of `max_games` is calculated as `n.bit_length() - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the method `bit_length()` will return the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, which for any integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 will always be at least 2. Therefore, `max_games` will be a non-negative integer.

The code then prints `max_games`, but since printing does not alter the value, the output state will retain all the relevant preconditions and update the value of `max_games`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, where `max_games` is a non-negative integer.**
