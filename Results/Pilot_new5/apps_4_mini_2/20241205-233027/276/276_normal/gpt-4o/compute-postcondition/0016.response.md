The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings that consist solely of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string in the tuple does not exceed 100,000. The function evaluates a polynomial based on the binary representation provided by the first string in the tuple. Specifically, it treats each character in the string as a binary digit, calculating the value based on the formula involving the golden ratio. 

Upon completion of the evaluation, the function returns a numerical value, which will be:
- 5 if the first string is '10'
- 6 if the first string is '11'
- 0 if the first string is '00'

If the first string consists of solely '0's, regardless of the second string, the result will always be 0. It is important to note that while the second string in the tuple is specified in the annotations, it is not utilized in the computation.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of two non-empty binary strings and returns a numerical result based on the polynomial evaluation of the first string, which can be 5, 6, or 0 depending on the binary representation of the first string. The second string is not used in the calculation. **
