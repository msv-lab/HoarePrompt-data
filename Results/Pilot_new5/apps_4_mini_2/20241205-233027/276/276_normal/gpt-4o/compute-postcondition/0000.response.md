The value of `q` is assigned the result of the expression `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`. The precondition regarding `s` remains unchanged, as the new assignment to `q` does not affect it. The calculation gives a specific numerical value for `q`.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple of two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where the length of each string does not exceed 100000; `q` is equal to (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2, which is approximately 1.618033988749895.**
