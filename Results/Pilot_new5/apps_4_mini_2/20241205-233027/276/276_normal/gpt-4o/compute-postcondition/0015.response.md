The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings composed of '0' and '1' characters, with each string having a length that does not exceed 100,000. After executing the function, it returns the result of a polynomial evaluation based on the binary representation of the strings in `s`. The possible return values are 5, 6, or 0, depending on the specific values contained within the tuple. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of two binary strings and return the result of a polynomial evaluation that can be 5, 6, or 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of two non-empty binary strings and returns the result of a polynomial evaluation based on these strings, which can be 5, 6, or 0.**
