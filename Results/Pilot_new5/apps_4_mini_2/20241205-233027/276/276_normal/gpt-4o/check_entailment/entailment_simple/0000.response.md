The program takes two binary strings representing numbers in a "golden system" and compares their decimal values based on the formula given in the problem description. It correctly defines a function, `func_1`, that calculates the value of a given binary string according to the specified conversion using the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). 

### Evaluation of Correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings consisting solely of '0's and '1's. This matches the input requirements of the problem description.

2. **Value Calculation**: The `func_1` function computes the decimal value of the given binary string by iterating through each character, and if the character is '1', it calculates the corresponding power of \( q \) based on its position. This implementation correctly follows the formula provided, which is:
   \[
   \text{Decimal value} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}
   \]
   The function correctly accumulates contributions only from '1's.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the values of both inputs, the program compares them correctly:
   - It prints '>' if the first number is larger,
   - It prints '<' if the second number is larger,
   - It prints '=' if both numbers are equal.
   This matches the output requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` accurately implements the conversion from the "golden system" to decimal value, and the comparison logic is sound. There are no edge cases or failures in logic that would cause it to deviate from the problem's requirements.

Therefore, since the program fulfills all aspects outlined in the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
