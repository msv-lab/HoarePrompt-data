#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `decimal` is the sum of `int(c) * q
    return decimal
    #The program returns the sum of the product of int(c) and q. Here, 'decimal' represents that sum.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `s` containing two non-empty strings of binary characters ('0' and '1'). It calculates the weighted sum of these binary strings using the golden ratio (Ï†) as the base and returns the resulting decimal value. The function does not specifically handle cases where the strings may not be of equal length or if they contain invalid characters, but it processes the strings as they are.
