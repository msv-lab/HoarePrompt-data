The variables `k` and `l` are assigned the values obtained from the `input` function, which takes space-separated integers and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous state of these variables is not known since they were inputs, but they will now hold the corresponding integer values entered by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` now contains the tuple (k, l)**
