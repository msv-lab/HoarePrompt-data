The `days` tuple is updated by appending the new tuple `(k, l)` to its previous elements. The previous values of `k` and `l` remain unchanged, and the other variable states remain intact. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `days`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(k, l)`**.
