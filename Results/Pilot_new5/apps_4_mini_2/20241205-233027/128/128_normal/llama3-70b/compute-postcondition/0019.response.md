Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second and first elements of each tuple `(k, l)` in descending order, and if `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is equal to `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` with `i` equal to 0. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `f`, then `sold` is equal to `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.***
