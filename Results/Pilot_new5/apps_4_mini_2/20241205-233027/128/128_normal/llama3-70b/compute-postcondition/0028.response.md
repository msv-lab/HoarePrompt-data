Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second and first elements of each tuple `(k, l)` in descending order, and `sold` is equal to the sum of `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` for `i` in the range `[0, f - 1]` and `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for `i` in the range `[f, n - 1]`.**
