Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second and first elements of each tuple `(k, l)` in descending order, and `i` is equal to 1. If `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is updated by adding `min(days[1][0] * 2, days[1][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[1][0], days[1][1])***.
