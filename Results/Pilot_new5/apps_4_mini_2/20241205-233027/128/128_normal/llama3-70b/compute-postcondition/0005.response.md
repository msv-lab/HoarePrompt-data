According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, meaning it will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` now contains the tuple (k, l)**
