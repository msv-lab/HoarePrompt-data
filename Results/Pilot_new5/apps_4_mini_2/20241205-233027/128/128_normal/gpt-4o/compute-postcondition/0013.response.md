The `potential_sales_increase` list is sorted in reverse order. The values of `n`, `f`, `days`, `regular_sales`, and `total_sales` remain unchanged. The only updated state is for `potential_sales_increase`, which is now sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each day, `potential_sales_increase` is a sorted list in descending order, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
