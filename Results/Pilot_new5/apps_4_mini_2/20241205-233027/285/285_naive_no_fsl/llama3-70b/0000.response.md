Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to the problem of determining whether Kolya could have spent his initial game-coins buying houses, cars, and computers, given the specific costs associated with each.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `n`, which represents the initial amount of game-coins Kolya has.

2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates over the number of houses `a` he could buy. Given that each house costs 1,234,567 coins, the range is limited to `n // 1234567 + 1` ensuring we do not overspend.

3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop calculates the number of cars `b` Kolya could potentially buy based on the remaining coins after accounting for the houses. This is done by subtracting the total spent on houses from `n` and dividing by the cost of a car (123,456).

4. **Computers Calculation**: The number of computers `c` is calculated based on what remains after accounting for the houses and cars. It checks if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (1,234).

5. **Checking Conditions**: If at any point the total coins spent matches `n`, it prints "YES" and exits. If the loops complete without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO".

The logic includes checking all non-negative integer combinations of houses, cars, and computers. Since the program correctly handles all potential cases within the specified constraints, I could not find any input case where it would fail to return the correct output as described.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program fulfills the requirements set forth in the problem description.
