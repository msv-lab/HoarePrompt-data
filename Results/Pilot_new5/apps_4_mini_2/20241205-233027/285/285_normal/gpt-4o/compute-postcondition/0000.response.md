The variable `house_cost` is assigned a specific value of `1234567`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and its precondition is still valid. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `house_cost` while maintaining the validity of the initial state of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
