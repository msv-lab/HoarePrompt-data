According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // house_cost`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

The condition for the loop to execute again is that `a` must remain less than or equal to `n // house_cost`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n // house_cost` must be at least 1, meaning that `n` must be at least equal to `house_cost`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1**
