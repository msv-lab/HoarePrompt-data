The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). After executing the function body, the function may return one of the following outcomes based on various conditions:

- Case 1: It returns 'YES' indicating that it is possible to purchase items with the given costs and remaining amounts.
- Case 2: It returns 'YES'.
- Case 3: It returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing cars with the given remaining amount after houses are satisfied.
- Case 4: It returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for `remaining_after_cars` being divisible by `computer_cost` are satisfied.
- Case 5: It returns 'YES'.
- Case 6: It returns 'YES' indicating a positive outcome based on the given initial conditions.
- Case 7: It returns 'YES' indicating that the current value of `remaining_after_cars` meets the condition being a multiple of `computer_cost`.
- Case 8: It returns 'YES'.
- Case 9: It returns 'YES' regardless of the values of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `remaining_after_cars`.
- Case 10: It returns 'NO' because there is no combination found based on the initial state variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and evaluate various conditions to return 'YES' or 'NO' based on the possibility of purchasing items given the associated costs and remaining amounts. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on various conditions related to purchasing items with given costs and remaining amounts.**
