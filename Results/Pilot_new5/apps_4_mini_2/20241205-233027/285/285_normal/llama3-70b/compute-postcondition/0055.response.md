Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `a` is at most `(n // 1234567)`, `b` is at most `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`, and `c` is non-negative such that `c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. If there exists any combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n`, 'YES' is printed and the program terminates. If no such combination is found after all iterations, the program completes without printing 'YES'.**
