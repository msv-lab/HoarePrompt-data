Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `a` is 1, `b` is the maximum possible value satisfying `b ≤ (n - 1234567) // 123456`, `c` is equal to `(n - 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234` after all iterations. If the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is satisfied for some iteration, 'YES' has been printed and the program has terminated. If `b` exceeds the calculated limit for any valid `n`, the loop doesn't execute and `b` remains at its initial calculated value, which is 0.**
