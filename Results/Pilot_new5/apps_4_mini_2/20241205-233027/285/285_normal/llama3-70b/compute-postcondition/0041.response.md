The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' but does not modify any variables. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables without any alterations.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2469134, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - 2469134) // 1234`, and the value of `n` is equal to `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234**.
