The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program's execution immediately. No variables are updated or changed in value because the program stops running. Therefore, the valid information from the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - 1234567) // 1234`, and the relationship `(1 * 1234567 + 0 * 123456 + c * 1234 == n)` holds true. The output is 'YES'.**
