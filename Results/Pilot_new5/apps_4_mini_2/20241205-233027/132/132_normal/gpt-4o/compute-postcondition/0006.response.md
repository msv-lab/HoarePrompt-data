The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables remain unchanged as the print function does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element `x_i` satisfies 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input; `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the elements in `y`; the current value of `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, and 'No' is printed to the output.
