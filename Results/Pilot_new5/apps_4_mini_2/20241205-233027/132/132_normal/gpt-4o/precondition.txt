n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, x is a list of integers of length n representing the initial number of stones in each pile where each x[i] is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x[i] <= 1000, and y is a list of integers of length n representing the number of stones in each pile the following day where each y[i] is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= y[i] <= 1000.
