Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a sorted list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit; `y` is a sorted list of integers such that the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed. Otherwise, the lists `x` and `y` are not equal.***
