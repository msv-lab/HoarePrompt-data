The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `n` is implicitly defined as the length of the lists `x` and `y`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50. The parameter `x` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) (0 <= \( x_i \) <= 1000) represents the number of stones in pile \( i \) during the first visit. The parameter `y` is a list of integers where each element \( y_i \) (0 <= \( y_i \) <= 1000) represents the number of stones in pile \( i \) during the second visit. After executing the function body, it computes some output based on the contents of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, x and y, each with a length of n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 50. Each element in x and y represents the number of stones in corresponding piles during two visits.**
