`y` is sorted in ascending order. Since `y` is a list of integers, its order will be rearranged, but the sum of its elements remains equal to the sum of the elements in `x`, as per the initial state. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a sorted list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit; `y` is a sorted list of integers equal to its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a sorted list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit; `y` is a sorted list of integers such that the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
