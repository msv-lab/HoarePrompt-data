The `x` list is sorted in ascending order. Since the initial state indicates that `x` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit, the order of the elements in `x` has been changed but the total sum remains the same. The other variables `n` and `y` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a sorted list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit; `y` is a list of integers such that the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
