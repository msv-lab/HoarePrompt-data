Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`. If the sum of the elements in list `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in list `y`, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, if the sums are equal and lists `x` and `y` are identical, 'Yes' is printed. If the sums are equal but the lists are not identical, no specific output is stated, but the sum condition is satisfied.***
