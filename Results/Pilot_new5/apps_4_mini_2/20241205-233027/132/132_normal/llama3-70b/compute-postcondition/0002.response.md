`y` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `input` values (which are space-separated strings of integers) to integers. The value of `n` indicates that there can be between 1 and 50 integers inputted, so `y` will be a list of integers with a length ranging from 1 to `n`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit; `y` is a list of integers created from input values.**
