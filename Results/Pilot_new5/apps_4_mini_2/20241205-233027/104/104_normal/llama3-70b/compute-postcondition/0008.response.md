According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues until `j` is equal to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` could be any value between 1 and `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. If the last value of `j` was `n`, then for the next iteration, `j` will increment to `n + 1`, which would terminate the loop. However, if `j` was less than `n`, then it can be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, if `max_erase` has been updated at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop condition was satisfied, meaning `j` must have been incremented to the next value. 

Therefore, the next state will have `j` incremented by 1, and to execute the loop again, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` remains within the bounds.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is either 0 or `j - 1`, and `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `j` must be in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.**
