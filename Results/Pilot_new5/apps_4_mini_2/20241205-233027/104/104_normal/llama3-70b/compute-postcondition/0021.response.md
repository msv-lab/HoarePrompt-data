The code updates the value of `max_erase`. The expression `j - i - 1` calculates the difference between `j` and `i` (which is `n + 2 - 1`), and then subtracts 1, resulting in `n + 1`. The maximum function will determine whether the current value of `max_erase` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, and if so, it will update `max_erase` to `n + 1`. The value of `max_erase` may change, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 2`, `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n + 1`.**
