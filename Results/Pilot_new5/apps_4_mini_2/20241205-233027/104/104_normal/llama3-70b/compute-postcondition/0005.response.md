Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and the elements of `a` from index `i` to `j-1` form a sequence such that for all `k` in the range of `i` to `j`, the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` equals the difference between `k` and `i`.***
