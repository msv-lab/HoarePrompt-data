The code updates the value of `max_erase` by comparing its current value with `j - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, we can calculate `j - i - 1` as follows: 

- `j - i - 1` = `3 - 2 - 1` = `0`.

Assuming that `max_erase` has an initial value that is less than or equal to 0, `max_erase` will remain the same. If `max_erase` has a value greater than 0, it will remain unchanged since `0` will not be greater than `max_erase`.

Since the problem does not specify the initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot determine a specific outcome for this variable.

Therefore, we summarize that `max_erase` will either stay the same or remain unchanged, while all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `max_erase` remains either unchanged or the same as its previous value.**
