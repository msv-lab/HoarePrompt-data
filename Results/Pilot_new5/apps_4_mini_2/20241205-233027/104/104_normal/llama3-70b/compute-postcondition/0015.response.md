According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is still between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum number of elements that can be erased from the list `a` starting from index `i`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`**
