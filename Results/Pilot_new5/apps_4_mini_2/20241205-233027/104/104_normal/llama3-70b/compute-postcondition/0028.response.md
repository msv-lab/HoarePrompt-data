For the provided for loop to execute, we need to consider the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. 

1. Since `i` is given as 2, the starting point for `j` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
2. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is between 2 and 100, `n + 1` will be between 3 and 101.
3. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `j` can take values from 3 to `n + 1`.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, the smallest value for `n` (which is 2) results in `j` taking the values from 3 to 3 (which means it will execute once), and the largest value for `n` (which is 100) allows `j` to take values from 3 to 101 (which means it will execute 99 times).

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `i` is 2, meaning `j` starts from 3,
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure that `j` can reach at least 3,
- The maximum number of iterations is determined by `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.**
