The value of `max_erase` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the result of the expression `j - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the expression evaluates to `1 - 0 - 1 = 0`. Thus, `max_erase` will be assigned the maximum value between its current value and 0.

Since `max_erase` can either be its current value or 0, we cannot determine an explicit new value for `max_erase` without knowing its initial value. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `max_erase` remains either unchanged or is set to 0 if its initial value was negative.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `max_erase` is updated to `max(max_erase, 0)`**.
