According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for the next value of `j`, which is incremented by 1 starting from `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is 4. The next value for `j` will be 5.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 4 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 5.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 5 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
