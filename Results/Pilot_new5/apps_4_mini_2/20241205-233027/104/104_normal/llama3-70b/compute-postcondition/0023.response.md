According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `j` is currently equal to `n + 2`. Since the loop's range is from `i + 1` (which is 2) to `n + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `j` incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value, which would be `n + 1`. However, since the loop's condition specifies that `j` should go up to `n + 1`, it is required that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to run. 

Thus, we update `j` to be `n + 1` for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`**
