`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input integers (from a space-separated string) to a list of integers. The previous values of `n` and the properties of `a` indicate that `a` will now be a list of integers as specified by the input. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is derived from input and satisfies 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000.**
