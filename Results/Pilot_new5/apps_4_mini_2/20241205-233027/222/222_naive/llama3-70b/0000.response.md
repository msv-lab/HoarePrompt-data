To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided program and how it relates to the requirements:

### Problem Description Recap:
Miroslav wants to turn over `n` skewers, where each turning affects `k` skewers on both sides of the selected skewer. The objective is to achieve turning over all `n` skewers with the minimum number of actions.

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the minimal number of actions required to turn over all skewers and determines which skewers to turn. The core logic is as follows:
1. It calculates the number of actions `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula computes how many full segments of size `(k * 2 + 1)` fit into `n`.
2. It constructs a list `res` that contains the indices of the skewers to turn over, which are spaced `(k * 2 + 1)` apart, starting from skewer 1.

### Edge Cases:
1. **k = 0**: In this case, each turn will affect only the skewer itself. We expect the program to turn over each skewer individually. Thus, the output should be `n` actions for `n` skewers, with the list of skewers being `1, 2, ..., n`.
2. **n < k**: The program should handle cases where `k` is larger than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 5`, turning skewer `1` will affect skewers `1`, `2`, and `3`, thereby turning them all over in one action.

### Test Cases:
- If we test the program with `n = 3` and `k = 0`, the expected output should be:
  ```
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
  However, the program will output `3` and `1 1 1` because of how it calculates the skewers to turn, which is incorrect.
  
- Testing with `n = 4` and `k = 1`, we would expect:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  ```
  The program seems to handle this correctly, outputting the required skewers.

- Testing with `n = 5` and `k = 2`, we expect:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  ```
  The program should output this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in the case where `k = 0` as it outputs the same skewer multiple times instead of turning all individual skewers. Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not function correctly for the scenario where `k = 0`, where it should turn over each skewer individually.
