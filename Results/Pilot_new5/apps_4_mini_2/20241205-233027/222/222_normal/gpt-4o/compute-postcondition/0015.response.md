The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 <= k <= 1000). It generates a list called `positions` that contains a sequence of integers starting from 1 and incrementing by `2 * k + 1` for each subsequent element, until the next value would exceed `n`. After constructing this list, the function prints the length of `positions` and the elements of the list as a space-separated string. 

However, the function does not return any values; it only prints output to the console. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compute and display the sequence of integers generated based on the parameters `n` and `k`, while not returning a value but rather just printing the results.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 with increments of `2 * k + 1` until exceeding `n`, and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, but does not return any values. **
