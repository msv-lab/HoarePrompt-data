To determine the output state after the while loop has executed, let's analyze the loop according to the provided initial state and code.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000)
- `positions` is an empty list
- `i` is 1

Code of the loop:
```
while i <= n:
    positions.append(i)
    i += 2 * k + 1
```

### Iteration Analysis
1. **After 1 execution of the loop:**
   - `positions` contains `[1]`.
   - `i` is updated to `1 + 2 * k + 1` which simplifies to `2 * k + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

2. **After 2 executions of the loop:**
   - `positions` contains `[1, 2 * k + 2]`.
   - `i` is now `2 * k + 2 + 2 * k + 1`, which simplifies to `4 * k + 3`.
   - For the loop to execute twice, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`.

3. **After 3 executions of the loop:**
   - `positions` contains `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`.
   - `i` is now `4 * k + 3 + 2 * k + 1`, simplifying to `6 * k + 4`.
   - For the loop to execute three times, `n` must be greater than or equal to `4 * k + 3`.

### General Output State
After the loop has executed a total of `m` times, where `m` is the maximum number of iterations possible while maintaining the condition `i <= n`, we can conclude:

- The final value of `i` after the loop ends will be `i = (m * (2 * k + 1)) + 1`.
- The `positions` list will contain the values `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3, ..., (2 * k + 1)*(m - 1) + 1]`.
- The loop will stop executing when `i` exceeds `n`, meaning `n` must be at least as large as `i` after the last valid iteration.

Thus, if the loop executed `m` times, the conditions are:
- If `m` was the total number of times the loop executed, then `i` will be `2 * k * m + m + 1`.
  
Output State: **`positions` contains all values `1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3, ..., (2 * k + 1)*(m - 1) + 1`; `i` is `2 * k * m + m + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k * m + m + 1`.**
