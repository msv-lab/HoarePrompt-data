The code provided prints the elements of `positions` as a string, joined by spaces. The variables remain unchanged, and only the output from the print statement will be generated as a result. Therefore, the output will reflect the state of `positions` as it is.

Output State: **`positions` contains all values generated by the formula; `i` is `2 * k * m + m + 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k * m + m + 1`.**
