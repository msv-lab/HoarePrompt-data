The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), reads them from input, computes the value of `l` as the ceiling of `n` divided by `(2k + 1)`, and generates a list `res` containing `l` elements, where each element follows the pattern `i * (2k + 1) + 1`. It then prints the value of `l` and the elements of `res` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any values but outputs results to standard output.
