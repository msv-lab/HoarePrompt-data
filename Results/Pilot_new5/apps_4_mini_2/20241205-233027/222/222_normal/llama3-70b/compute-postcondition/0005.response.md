According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `l` is greater than 0, so the loop can execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `l` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute beyond the current iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing the value 1.**
