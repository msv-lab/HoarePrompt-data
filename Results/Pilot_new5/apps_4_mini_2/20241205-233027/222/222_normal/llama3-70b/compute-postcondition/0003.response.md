To determine whether the loop will execute, we need to analyze the variable `l`. The loop is defined to iterate `l` times. The value of `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be greater than 0. We can derive conditions based on `n` and `k`:

1. The expression `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` results in `0` when `n + k - 1 < (k * 2 + 1)`. 
2. Rearranging the inequality gives us `n + k < (k * 2 + 1)`, or equivalently `n < (k * 2 + 1) - k`, which simplifies to `n < k + 1`.

Therefore, for `l` to be at least 1, we need:
- `n + k >= (k * 2 + 1)`, or equivalently, `n >= k + 1`.

Assuming `k` can be `0`, then `n` must be at least `1` to ensure `l` is at least `1`.

Given this understanding, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute. The variable `i` will start at `0` at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are:
- `l` must be greater than 0,
- `i` must start from 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is an empty list.**
