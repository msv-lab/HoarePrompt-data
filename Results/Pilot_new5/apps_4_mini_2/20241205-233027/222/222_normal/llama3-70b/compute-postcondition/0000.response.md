The variables `n` and `k` are both assigned new values based on the input provided to the program. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes input from the user, splits it into two parts (expected to be two integers), and converts them to integers. Consequently, the previous values of `n` and `k` are replaced by the input values.

Since the specific values for `n` and `k` are unknown and depend on user input, we note that `n` remains a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `k` remains a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), and their new values will be based on the input received.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), with new values assigned from input.**
