To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it relates to the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side) from standard input.

2. **Calculation of Actions `l`**:
   - The program calculates `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula represents the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers, as each action can turn over `2k + 1` skewers (k from each side of the skewer being turned plus the skewer itself).

3. **Generating Results**:
   - The program generates a list `res` which contains the skewer numbers that need to be turned over. The pattern used is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which indicates that the program is selecting skewers spaced `2k + 1` apart.
   - The first element (1) is correct as it ensures that the first skewer is turned over. Then it continues to generate positions that ensure all skewers are covered within the range.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints `l`, the number of actions, and the skewer numbers to be turned over.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description

The problem description states that all skewers must be turned over with the minimum number of actions, and the program achieves this by:
- Computing `l` correctly as the minimum number of operations required.
- Generating the correct skewer indices to turn over, ensuring the coverage of all skewers based on the state change rules described in the problem.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem by calculating the necessary number of actions and producing the output that reflects the skewer positions that need to be turned. 

Thus, the program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
