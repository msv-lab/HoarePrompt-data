To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the function `func()`.

1. **Understanding the Inputs:**
   - `N`: Total different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of different collectible coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted to Ivan.

2. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift, using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This effectively computes the ceiling of `L / M`.
   - It then checks if the total number of coins that would be gifted (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of new coins available (`N - K`). If this condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Key Conditions to Verify:**
   - The program correctly identifies the condition where the total number of different coins that can be gifted must not exceed the difference between total coins and the coins Ivan already has (`N - K`).
   - The program also calculates the minimum number of coins per friend needed to ensure at least `L` new coins.

4. **Identifying Potential Cases:**
   - **Case when `N` is equal to `K`:** If Ivan already has all the collectible coins (`N == K`), then regardless of the values of `M` and `L`, it should be impossible to gift any new coins. The program will output `-1` in this case, which is correct.
   - **Case when `M` is greater than `N`:** If there are more friends than different coins (`M > N`), the program should also return `-1`, as not all friends can gift different coins. This is handled correctly in the program.
   - **Edge Case Check:** Let's consider a case where `N = 5`, `M = 2`, `K = 3`, and `L = 3`. Here, Ivan has 3 coins already. The calculation of `min_x` would be `(3 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 2`. However, the required `M * min_x` equals `4`, and since `N - K` is `5 - 3 = 2`, the program will output `-1`, which is also correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
After checking various potential edge cases and verifying that the conditions in the problem description are met by the logic within the program, I find no cases where the output would be incorrect. The program seems to handle all scenarios as required.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
