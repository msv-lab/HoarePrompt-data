To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the requirements and how the code addresses them.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Each of Ivan's M friends must gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least L coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Inputs:
- N: Total different collectible coins.
- M: Number of Ivan's friends.
- K: Number of coins Ivan already has.
- L: Minimum new coins that must be gifted.

### Code Analysis:
The function checks:
1. If `M >= N - K + 1`: This checks if the number of friends (M) is at least as large as the number of different coins available after accounting for the coins Ivan already has (N - K). This ensures that all friends can gift different coins.
2. If `M >= L`: This checks if the number of friends (M) is at least equal to the minimum number of new coins needed (L).

If both conditions are satisfied, it prints `1`, suggesting that the minimum number of coins each friend can gift is `1`. If either condition fails, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The condition `M >= N - K + 1` implies that there should be enough different coins for each friend. However, if `K` is close to `N`, then the coins available for gifting become very limited. Specifically, if `M > N - K + 1`, it means there are not enough different coins for all friends.
- The logic doesn't account for scenarios where even if `M` is less than `N - K + 1`, it's still possible to meet the requirement of gifting new coins. For example, if `M` is greater than `L` but the total number of friends exceeds the available new coins, it may still be valid for the friends to gift a certain number of coins equally.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Consider the case:
- Input: `10 11 2 4`
- This would imply 10 different coins and 11 friends. However, since Ivan only has 2 of them, there are only 8 different coins left to gift. Therefore, it's impossible for 11 friends to gift him any new coins while keeping them all different. The program correctly returns `-1` in this case.

However, consider the case:
- Input: `5 3 3 2`
- Ivan has 3 coins, meaning only 2 coins are left (5 - 3). Ivan needs at least 2 new coins (L = 2). Even if he receives gifts from 3 friends, they cannot gift him 2 new coins because there aren't enough distinct coins left. The program should return `-1`, but it would incorrectly return `1`, as both conditions would seem to pass.

### Conclusion:
Since there are scenarios where the logic fails to accurately determine if the conditions can be fulfilled based on the parameters provided, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to address every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
