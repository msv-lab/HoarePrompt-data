The code simply prints `-1` and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions without any modifications to `N`, `M`, `K`, or `L`. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. It is not the case that M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 or M is greater than or equal to L. Thus, M < N - K + 1 or M < L.**
