To assess the correctness of the given program, let's analyze both the problem description and the provided code:

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Ivan has collectible coins: N different types, of which he already has K.
2. M friends want to gift him coins.
3. All friends must gift the same number of coins, and all gifted coins must be different.
4. At least L of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
- The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if there are enough friends (M) to provide coins such that there are at least as many different coins as the total number of collectible coins minus the ones Ivan already has (K) plus one (to ensure every friend gives a different coin).
- The condition `M >= L` ensures that the number of friends is at least L, meaning that at least L new coins can be gifted.
- If both conditions are met, the program prints `1`, indicating that it's feasible for each friend to gift at least one coin.
- If either condition fails, it prints `-1`, indicating impossibility.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **When M = 0**: If Ivan has no friends (M = 0), then the output should be `-1` because gifts cannot be given. The code handles this correctly since `M >= L` would fail if L â‰¥ 1.
  
2. **When K = N**: If Ivan already has all collectible coins, then `N - K` equals `0`. The program will check if M >= 1 and L <= 0 (which is not possible). Therefore, it correctly handles the situation where all coins are already in possession.

3. **When M > N**: If there are more friends than collectible coins (`M > N`), the program still checks if M is greater than or equal to both conditions. If N - K + 1 (which is the number of different coins remaining) is less than M, the output should still be `-1`, correctly reflecting the impossibility.

4. **When L > N - K**: If the number of new coins required L exceeds the number of coins Ivan does not already have (which is `N - K`), the program should output `-1`. The code does check if M >= L, but it doesn't adequately verify if M can actually provide L unique new coins.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints state that the function will print `1` if both conditions are satisfied and `-1` otherwise. This matches the implementation. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the total number of different coins is insufficient to fulfill gift requirements while ensuring they are unique.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the program logic, all relevant scenarios appear to be accounted for, but the check for unique new coins (ensuring that at least L coins are indeed new) could be better handled. There is a situation where M could be large, but if L is greater than the coins left (N - K), it would lead to impractical gifting scenarios. 

Thus, the final assessment is that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation for Incorrectness:
For example, if `N = 10`, `K = 5`, `M = 5`, and `L = 6`, the program would output `-1`, indicating it's not possible; however, it is possible since friends can only gift unique coins (5 new coins). Hence, the problem is not correctly addressed in all edge cases.
