The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from input. It calculates the minimum number of units min_x required such that M multiplied by min_x does not exceed N minus K. If this condition is satisfied, it outputs min_x; otherwise, it outputs -1. The function does not return a value, but instead prints the result directly based on the conditions evaluated.
