The statement `high = mid - 1` updates the variable `high` to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is not specified in the initial state, so we denote it as `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`, `high` is `mid - 1`.**
