Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(v)`, and `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, such that this sum is equal to `s`. The loop has executed at least once, and the final value of `low` is the last `mid` calculated where the sum was less than `s`. Since the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` equals `s`, `total` was not always greater than or equal to `s`, indicating that `high` was not adjusted downwards. The loop terminates with `low` and `high` converging to a single point.***
