The variable `total_volume` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `volumes`. The initial state specifies that `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, with each integer satisfying `1 <= v_i <= 10^9`. 

Let's denote the sum of the elements in `volumes` as `sum(volumes)`, which results in `total_volume`. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the second input value such that 1 <= s <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers from input where each integer satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9; `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`.**
