According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is between 1 and 1000, the loop can execute again if `i` increments by 1. 

After the current iteration, `i` should be increased to 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9), `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `0`, `i` is 1**
