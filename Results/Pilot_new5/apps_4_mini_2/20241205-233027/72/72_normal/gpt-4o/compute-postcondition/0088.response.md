Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions` are positive integers. If `direction` is 1, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `max_questions` are increased by 1, `sergei_questions` and `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is set to -1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2` while `col` remains 0. If `direction` is not 1, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `max_questions` are decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` and `remaining_questions` are positive integers, and if `row` is -1, then `direction` is set to 1, `row` is set to 1, and `col` remains 0.***
