The value of `direction` is assigned `-1`, changing its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is now `row + 1`, `col` is 0, the current value of `direction` is -1, and the current value of `row` equals `n`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is now `row + 1`, `col` is 0, the current value of `direction` is -1, and the current value of `row` equals `n`.**
