According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for each value of `col` in the range from 0 to `m - 1`. Since `m` is given as a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be at least 1, meaning the loop can execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `col` would be `m - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `col` starts at 0 and can iterate up to `m - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0**
