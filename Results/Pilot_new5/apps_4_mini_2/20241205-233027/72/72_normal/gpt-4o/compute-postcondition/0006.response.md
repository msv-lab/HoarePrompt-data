The variable `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. The value of `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned an input positive integer, `m` is assigned an input positive integer, `k` is assigned an input positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n = 1`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input positive integer, `m` is assigned an input positive integer, `k` is assigned an input positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n = 1`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
