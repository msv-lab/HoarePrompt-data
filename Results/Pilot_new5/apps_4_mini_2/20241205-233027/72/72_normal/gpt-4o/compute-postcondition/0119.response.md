According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, which allows for at least one iteration of the loop. The state of `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1 as specified. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `col` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, following these points, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is unchanged, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is unchanged, `direction` is unchanged, `col` is 0**.
