The value of `direction` is assigned to -1. This changes `direction` from its previous value but does not affect any other variables. Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n`, `m` must be greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` is -1; `row` is `row + direction`; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 1; if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.
