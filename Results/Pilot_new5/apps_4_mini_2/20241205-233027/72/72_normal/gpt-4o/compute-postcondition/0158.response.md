The code `row -= 2` decreases the value of `row` by 2. The previous value of `row` was `row + (-1)`, which means the new value of `row` will be `row + (-1) - 2`, simplifying to `row - 3`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `col`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged from the initial state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `col` is now `col + 1`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is now `row - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `col` is now `col + 1`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is now `row - 3**.
