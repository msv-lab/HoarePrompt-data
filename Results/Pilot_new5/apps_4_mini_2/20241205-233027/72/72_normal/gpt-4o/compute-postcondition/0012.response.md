In the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. Based on the code provided, `sergei_questions` is assigned the value of `min_questions`. However, the calculations related to `min_questions` are dependent on the values of `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, and `max_questions`, which are only computed if `n` is greater than 1.

If `n` is greater than 1, then:
- `full_cycles` would be equal to `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`
- `remaining_questions` would be equal to `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`
- `min_questions` would be equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`
- `max_questions` would be equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`

In this case, `sergei_questions` would be assigned `min_questions`.

If `n` equals 1, then the calculations related to `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are not executed, and `sergei_questions` would not change from its previous state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; if `n` is greater than 1, then `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
