According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_questions`. If `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Since the state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `remaining_questions` remains unchanged, it is implied that it was greater than 0 before the last iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, and since it is decreased by 1 after each iteration, it should be at least 1 before the next iteration. The value of `_` is not essential for the loop condition but indicates the current count of iterations.

Thus, we need to ensure that `remaining_questions` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` remain unchanged from their initial state; `row` remains as initially set, and `direction` remains unchanged, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1**
