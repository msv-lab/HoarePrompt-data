The value of `max_questions` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `max_questions` is a positive integer greater than 2, so after the operation, it remains a positive integer greater than 1. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `m`, `k`, `direction`, `remaining_questions`, `_`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, and `sergei_questions`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 2; `k` are positive integers greater than 1; `direction` is either 1 or -1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is a positive integer greater than 1**.
