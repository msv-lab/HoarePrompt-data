The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. Since it is a straightforward assignment, only the value of `direction` changes. The other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `row` is equal to `n - 2 + (-1)`; `col` equals `m - 1`; and `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`; `direction` is -1.**
