Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, and `k` is unchanged. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `col` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `row` is decreased by 3. If `row` is -1, then `col` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 2, and `direction` is set to 1.***
