The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `row` has been increased by -1, so the new value of `row` is effectively the previous value minus 1 minus 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is now `previous value of row - 3`; `direction` is -1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is now `previous value of row - 3`; `direction` is -1.**
