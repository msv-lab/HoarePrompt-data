Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycles` is equal to `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` equals 1, the else part does not apply, and the calculations related to `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are not executed.***
