Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, and `direction` is -1. If `row` equals `n`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is now equal to `row - 2`, and `col` remains `col + 1` if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.***
