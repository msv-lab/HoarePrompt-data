Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Questions:**
   The calculations of `min_questions` and `max_questions` are based on incorrect formulas. The problem requires counting how many times each pupil can be asked questions based on the number of cycles through all rows, but the way `min_questions` and `max_questions` are derived does not accurately reflect the distribution of questions across pupils. 

2. **Handling of the Rows:**
   The logic for determining how many questions Sergei is asked (`sergei_questions`) when he is in the first or last row is flawed. The use of integer division by `(2 * n - 2)` is incorrect for the context, as it doesnâ€™t take into account how many complete cycles of questioning fit within the total questions `k`.

3. **Adjustments in the Loop:**
   The loop that simulates the remaining questions does not correctly maintain the `max_questions` variable. The logic for counting questions in alternating directions (up and down the rows) is not properly implemented, which means that the total questions asked to each pupil can diverge from expectations based on `k`.

4. **Global Conditions Not Addressed:**
   The case where `n` is 1 is not handled appropriately in both the question count and how many times Sergei is asked questions. The program should ensure that if there is only one row, all questions should go to the pupils in that row, but the logic mistakenly introduces complex conditions that are unnecessary.

5. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   For very high values of `k` (close to \(10^{18}\)), the calculations may lead to integer overflow or inaccuracies since some intermediate calculations do not take into account the constraints properly.

Due to these discrepancies, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
