The variable `max_asked` is assigned the value of `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged in the context of this calculation, but we now have a specific value for `max_asked` based on the expression provided. The output state will reflect the new value of `max_asked` along with the initial state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils per row, `k` is a positive integer indicating the total number of questions asked, `x` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement, `y` is an integer representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement, `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**
