Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the edge cases involved in the asking order of students based on the problem description. While it attempts to calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions asked, the logic for determining how many times Sergei is asked (`sergei_asked`) is flawed.

For instance, consider the case where `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 5`, `x = 1`, and `y = 1`. The expected order of questioning should be:
1. Row 1, Student 1
2. Row 1, Student 1
3. Row 2, Student 1
4. Row 2, Student 1
5. Row 1, Student 1

In this case, Sergei (in Row 1, Column 1) would be asked 3 times. However, based on the current logic, the calculation might not yield this result, especially when considering larger values of `k` that cycle through the rows. 

Moreover, the calculation for `min_asked` does not accurately reflect the minimum number of questions asked, as it relies on the `max_asked` calculation which is also flawed.

Thus, there are potential inputs where the output does not align with the requirements of the problem, confirming that the program is incorrect.
