Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, and `target_pos` is in `position_map`.***
