Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, and `op` is the character at index `n`. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is not 'R', `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
