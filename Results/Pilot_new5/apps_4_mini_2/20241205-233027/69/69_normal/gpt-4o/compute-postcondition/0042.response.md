The value of `min_length` is assigned to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This change does not affect the values of `final_x`, `dx`, or `dy`. The states of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity.**
