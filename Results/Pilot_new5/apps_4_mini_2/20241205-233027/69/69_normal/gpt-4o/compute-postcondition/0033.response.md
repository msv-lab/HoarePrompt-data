Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 199999), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', `final_x` remains unchanged.***
