The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `x - final_x`. The value of `final_x` is defined as the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L', respectively. Other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x**.
