Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of `dx` or `dy` is non-zero; `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is found in `position_map`; `position_map` remains unchanged as {(0, 0): -1}; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is still 0; and `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.***
