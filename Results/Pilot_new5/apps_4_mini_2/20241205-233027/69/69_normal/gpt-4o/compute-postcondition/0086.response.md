Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of `dx` or `dy` is non-zero; if `target_pos` is found in `position_map`, then `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` is updated with the entry `(current_x, current_y): i`; `n` is greater than `k + 1`; and `i` is now `k + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1.***
