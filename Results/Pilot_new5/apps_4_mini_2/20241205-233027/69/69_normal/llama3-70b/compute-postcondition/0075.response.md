The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The initial states of `operations`, `op`, `dy`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, `res` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on the operation, and `dx` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, `res` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on the operation, `dx` is decreased by 1.**
