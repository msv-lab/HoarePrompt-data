Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 0, `op` is the first character in `operations` which is not 'U', and `dy` is less than or equal to 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is reduced by 1. In the else case, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is adjusted to be at least 0. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
