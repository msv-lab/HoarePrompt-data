The variable `ux` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`operations`, `ops`, `op`, `x`, `y`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`) remain unaffected based on the initial state provided. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `ux` after the operation, while retaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string; `op` is 'L'; the values of `x`, `y`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remain as initially given; `ux` is decremented by 1.**
