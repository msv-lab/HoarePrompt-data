The value of `dx` is incremented by 1, while the other variables `operations`, `op`, `dy`, and `res` remain unchanged. The value of `dx` is updated, but its previous value is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `dx`.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` remains unchanged, `dx` is incremented by 1, `res` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on the operation.**
