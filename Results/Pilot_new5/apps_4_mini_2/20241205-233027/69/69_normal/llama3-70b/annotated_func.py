    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`operations` is a string of length `n`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, `-1` is returned. Otherwise, `dy` represents the net vertical movement after executing all valid 'U' and 'D' operations, and `dx` represents the net horizontal movement after executing all valid 'R' and 'L' operations; `res` is the count of operations that did not result in any movement, and its value has been printed, with `x` and `y` remaining unchanged, alongside `lx` and `ly`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string of operations consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net horizontal and vertical movements based on the operations. If the net movements required to reach (x, y) from the origin exceed the movements provided, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts how many operations did not result in any net movement towards the target coordinates and prints this count. If `n` is 0 (though not allowed per specified constraints), the function would not handle this case properly but would effectively return no usable result since the loop wouldn't execute.
