The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1. The character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G'.
