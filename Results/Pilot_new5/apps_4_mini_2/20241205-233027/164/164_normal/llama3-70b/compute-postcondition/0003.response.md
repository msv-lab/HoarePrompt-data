According to the code, the loop will execute for `n` iterations, where `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. The conditions on `n` and `k` are already satisfied as `n` is between 2 and 100, and `k` is between 1 and `n-1`. 

However, the values of `s`, `g`, and `t` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself; they may be relevant in the loop body but do not prevent the loop from running. The loop can execute without any adjustments to these variables. 

At the beginning of the first iteration, `i` will start at 0. Therefore, the relevant states before the first execution of the loop are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
