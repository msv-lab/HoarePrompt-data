According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), the loop can still execute as long as \( n > 1 \). 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 2, `g` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[2]` is 'G', while `t` is set to 1 if `s[2]` is 'T' and remains -1 if `s[2]` is not 'T'; `n` must be greater than 2.**
