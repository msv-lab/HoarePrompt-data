Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a string `s` of length `n` that contains exactly one 'G', one 'T', and any combination of '.' and '#'. It checks if it is possible to reach 'T' from 'G' by moving `k` steps at a time, without encountering any obstacles represented by '#'. If 'G' or 'T' are not found in the string, it prints 'NO'. If the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k` and there are no obstacles in the path, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
