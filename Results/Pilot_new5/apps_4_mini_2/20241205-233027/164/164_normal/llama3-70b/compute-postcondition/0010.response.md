Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is set to 0 and `t` remains -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0; otherwise, `g` remains -1 and `t` remains -1 when the character at index `i` is neither 'G' nor 'T'.***
