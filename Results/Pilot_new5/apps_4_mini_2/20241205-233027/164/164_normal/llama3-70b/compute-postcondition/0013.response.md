The value of `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `g`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `g` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', and `t` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `g` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', `t` is 1**
