The variable `s` is assigned the value from `input()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. The output state includes the existing bounds for `n` and `k`, along with the new value assigned to `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `s` is an input string.**
