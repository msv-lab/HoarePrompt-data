The variables `G_pos` and `T_pos` are swapped in the code, meaning `G_pos` will take the value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos`. The initial conditions state that `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, so after the swap, `G_pos` will be less than `T_pos`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `line`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos`.**
