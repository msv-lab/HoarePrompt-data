Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` is updated to the previous value of `G_pos`.***
