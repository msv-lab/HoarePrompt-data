The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True if `pos` equals `T_pos`, otherwise it is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
