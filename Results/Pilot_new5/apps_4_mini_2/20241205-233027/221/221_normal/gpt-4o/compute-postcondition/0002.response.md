The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `x`. The parameter `s` is a positive integer in the range from 2 to 10^12, and `x` is a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to 10^12. After executing the function body, the output behavior is not specified in the given information. Therefore, without additional details about the conditions and return values, we cannot define specific return cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, s (a positive integer between 2 and 10^12) and x (a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12). The specific return values based on these inputs are not provided.**
