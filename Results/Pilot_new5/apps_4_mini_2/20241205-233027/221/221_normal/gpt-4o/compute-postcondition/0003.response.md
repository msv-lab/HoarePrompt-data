Functionality: ** The function performs bitwise XOR operations on the variables `a` and `b` using the value `x`, but it does not take any parameters or return any values. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not defined within the function, leaving the behavior of the function ambiguous. Therefore, the function's specific functionality cannot be determined accurately based solely on the provided code. **
