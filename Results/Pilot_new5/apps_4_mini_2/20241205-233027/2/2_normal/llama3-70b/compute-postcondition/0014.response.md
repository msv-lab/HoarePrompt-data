According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. Since the loop condition states that `i` should be less than or equal to `x`, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

The conditions for the other variables, `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num`, do not affect the ability of the loop to execute; hence, they remain unchanged. 

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2**
