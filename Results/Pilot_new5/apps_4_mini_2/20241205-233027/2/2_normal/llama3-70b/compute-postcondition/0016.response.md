The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Previously, `digit_sum` is 3, so now `max_sum` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 2**
