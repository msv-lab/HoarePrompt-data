The `max_sum` variable is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. Since `digit_sum` is currently greater than `max_sum`, this assignment will update `max_sum` to the current value of `digit_sum`. The previous conditions about `x`, `i`, and `digit_sum` remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 1; `digit_sum` is 1; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum` which is 1.**
