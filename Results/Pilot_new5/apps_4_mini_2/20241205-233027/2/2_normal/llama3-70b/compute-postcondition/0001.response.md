`max_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and all the conditions regarding `x` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0**.
