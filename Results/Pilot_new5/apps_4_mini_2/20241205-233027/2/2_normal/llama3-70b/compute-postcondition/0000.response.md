The value of `x` is reassigned with the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` will now hold the integer provided as input. The initial state specified that `x` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). Since the input must also fall within this range, `x` will still be a positive integer satisfying \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\).

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, and `x` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
