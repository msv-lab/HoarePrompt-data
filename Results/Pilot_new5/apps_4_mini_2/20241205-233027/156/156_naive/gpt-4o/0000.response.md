To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program logic step by step.

1. **Understanding the Movement**:
   - Lara starts at the top-left corner (1, 1).
   - She moves down to the bottom-left corner (n, 1).
   - Then she moves in a "snake-like" fashion, alternating between going right and left on each row.

2. **Analyzing the Input and Outputs**:
   - The program takes three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Depending on the value of `k`, it determines Lara's position after `k` moves.

3. **The Logic Implemented in the Program**:
   - The program checks if `k` is less than `n - 1` (the number of moves to reach the bottom-left corner). If so, it simply returns the position `(k + 1, 1)`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates how many full rows Lara can traverse (each row being `m - 1` moves). 
   - It then determines the remaining steps after completing full rows to find the exact cell in the current row.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that `n` is even, but it does not explicitly handle any edge cases, such as `k` values that could lead to invalid indices if `k` approaches `n*m`.
   - Specifically, when calculating the `remaining_steps`, if `k` is exactly equal to `n*m - 1`, the program might not compute the row and column correctly due to how rows and columns are indexed (it's off by one in certain operations).

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11`. The expected output is `(1, 2)`, which the program correctly calculates.
   - Now consider when `k = 10`. The program computes:
     ```python
     k -= n - 1  # k = 10 - 3 = 7
     full_rows = k // (m - 1)  # full_rows = 7 // 2 = 3
     remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)  # remaining_steps = 7 % 2 = 1
     ```
     However, it miscalculates the row and column, leading to potentially incorrect outputs when `full_rows` is large or when `remaining_steps` needs to be adjusted.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly manage the boundaries for all potential values of `k`, especially when it approaches the limits of the matrix dimensions. 

Correctness: **False**.
