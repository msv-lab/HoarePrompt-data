#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even; k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` (which is an odd integer) and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n·m`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the output is (`k + 1`, 1). Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to `k - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is `n - full_rows` (which is an odd integer) and `col` is `m - remaining_steps.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n` (even), `m`, and a non-negative integer `k`, and prints calculated coordinates based on the value of `k` relative to `n` and `m`, without returning any values.
