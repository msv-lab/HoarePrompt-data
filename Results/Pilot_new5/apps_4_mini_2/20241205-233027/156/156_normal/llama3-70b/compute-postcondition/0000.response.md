The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with the values provided by the input, where `input` accepts a space-separated string and `map(int, ...)` converts each part to an integer. The constraints state that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. 

Therefore, after this code execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` will have new integer values based on the user's input, but the exact values are not specified as they depend on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a new even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m` is a new integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is a new non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.**
