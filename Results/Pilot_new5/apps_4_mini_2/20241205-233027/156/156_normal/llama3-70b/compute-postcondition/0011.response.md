The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. The parameter `n` is an even integer, and both `n` and `m` are constrained by the limits 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ k < n·m. Since there is no direct output specified in the provided information, we cannot infer specific return values or messages. Therefore, the functionality of the function is defined by its parameter constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an even integer), m (an integer), and k (a non-negative integer), constrained by 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k < n·m.**
