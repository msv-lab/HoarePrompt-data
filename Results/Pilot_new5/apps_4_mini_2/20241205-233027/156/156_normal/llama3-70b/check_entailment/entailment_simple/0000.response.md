To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description
1. **Input:** The function takes three integers: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), and `k` (the number of moves Lara has made).
2. **Movement Path:**
   - Lara starts at (1, 1).
   - She moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then she moves in a "snake-like" fashion:
     - Move right across the last row (n, m).
     - Move up to (n-1, m).
     - Move left to (n-1, 1).
     - Move up to (1, 1), if needed.
   - This continues until all cells are visited.

3. **Output:** The function must output the final position (row, column) of Lara after `k` moves.

### Program Logic
Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which conforms to the constraints provided.

2. **Position Calculation:**
   - The line `k %= n * 2 - 2` is meant to limit `k` to the number of effective moves Lara can make in the snake-like pattern.
   - The subsequent if-else conditions handle the different segments of Lara's movement:
     - If `k < n - 1`: Lara is still moving down in the first column.
     - If `k < n * 2 - 2`: Lara is in the snake-like movement phase. The calculations for her position are based on the patterns established:
       - `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` calculates the current row.
       - `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` calculates the current column.
     - If `k` is not less than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `(1, 2)`, which indicates that she has finished her snake-like path and would end up in the next typical position after all others are visited.

### Verification Against Requirements
The program implements the logic of Lara's navigation through the dungeon and outputs her position correctly after `k` moves based on the described path. 

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** 
   - For `k = 0`, it correctly outputs (1, 1).
   - For `k` values in the ranges defined, it outputs the appropriate position according to the defined path.
   - The modulo operation ensures that it wraps around correctly for large `k` values.

2. **Performance:** 
   - Given that the constraints allow `n` and `m` to be large (up to `10^9`), the program effectively reduces the problem size with the modulo operation and avoids unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion
Since the program accurately captures the movement logic of Lara as defined in the problem description and correctly computes her position after `k` moves, we can confirm that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
