Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and `dp[1]` as the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, `j` is the index for the next iteration which must be less than `n`, `vol` is equal to 2, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`.*
