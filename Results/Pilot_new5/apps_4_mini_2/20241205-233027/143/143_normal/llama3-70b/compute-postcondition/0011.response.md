The value of `j` is currently 1, so we can calculate `vol` as follows:

`vol = 2 ** j - 1 = 2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and all other elements initialized to float('inf'), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and all other elements initialized to float('inf'), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.**
