According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to L inclusive. For the loop to execute, it is essential that L is at least 1, which is already guaranteed since `n` is between 1 and 30, and L is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).

At the start of the first iteration:
- The variable `i` will be 1, as the range starts from 1.

Since `L` meets the requirement of being greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 1, there are no adjustments needed to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`, with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and all other elements initialized to float('inf'), `i` is 1**
