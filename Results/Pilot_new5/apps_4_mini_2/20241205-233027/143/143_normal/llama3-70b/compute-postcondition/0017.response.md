Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `costs[1]`. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` provided `i` is at least 2.***
