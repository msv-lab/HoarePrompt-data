Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and all other elements initialized to float('inf'), `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[1]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[1 - vol] + costs[j]`, which results in `dp[1]` being `min(dp[1], dp[1] + costs[0])`.***
