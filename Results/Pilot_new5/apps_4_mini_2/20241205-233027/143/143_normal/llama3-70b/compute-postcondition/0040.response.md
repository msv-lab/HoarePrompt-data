According to the code, the loop runs for `j` in the range of `n`. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1. 

Given that `n` is between 1 and 30, `j` will be able to increment to 1 as long as `n` is at least 2. After incrementing, the new value of `j` will be 1, and `n` must remain the same to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 1, `i` is `k + 1`, and `vol` is 0**
