The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, the calculation becomes `2 ** 2 - 1`, which equals `4 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 2, `i` is `k + 1`, `vol` is 3; if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.**
