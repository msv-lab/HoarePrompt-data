Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is `k + 1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the available volumes derived from `c`, and `dp` is updated based on the possible volumes from the list of costs. If no volumes can be used, `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
