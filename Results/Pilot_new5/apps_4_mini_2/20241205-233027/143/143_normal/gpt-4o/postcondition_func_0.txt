The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list `costs`, and returns the minimum accumulated cost based on the specified conditions, considering the constraints of `L` and the provided costs. If `L` is insufficient to leverage the costs, the function may return a high value indicating this limitation.
