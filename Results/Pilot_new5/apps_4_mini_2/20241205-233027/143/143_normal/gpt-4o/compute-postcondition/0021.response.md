The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 30, we need to examine the value of `dp[30]`. However, since `dp[i]` is defined for `i` in the range from 0 to 29, `dp[30]` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Hence, `dp[30]` is undefined, and this will affect the calculation. 

The impact of the code results in the following updates:
- The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `dp[30]`, which is not defined.

Since `current_cost` cannot be updated due to `dp[30]` being undefined, we cannot specify a new value for `current_cost`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `current_cost` remains unchanged as it cannot be updated.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 30; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is 0; `L` is greater than or equal to `1 << i`; and `current_cost` remains unchanged since `dp[30]` is undefined.**
