The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

After executing the function body, it returns the minimum cost accumulated in 'answer' based on 'current_cost' and the sufficiency of 'L' during iterations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of integers `costs`, and return the minimum accumulated cost based on specific conditions related to `L` and the values in `costs`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive), L (a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive), and costs (a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive), and returns the minimum accumulated cost based on the specified conditions.**
