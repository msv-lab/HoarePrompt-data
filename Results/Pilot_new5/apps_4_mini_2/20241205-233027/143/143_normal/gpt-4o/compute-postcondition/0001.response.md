The variable `dp` is assigned a list containing 31 elements, each initialized to the value of `max_cost`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged, and thus the output state reflects the initialization of `dp`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10.**
