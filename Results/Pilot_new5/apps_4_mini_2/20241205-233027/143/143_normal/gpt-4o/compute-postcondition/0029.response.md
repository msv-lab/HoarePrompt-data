The variable `answer` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the expression `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` is already specified as `min(10, costs[i])`, where `i` is 29, thus the value becomes `dp[29]`. The expression `(L > 0)` evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the value of `L`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 29; `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29])`**
