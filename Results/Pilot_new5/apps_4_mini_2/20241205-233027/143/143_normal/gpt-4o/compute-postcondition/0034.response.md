The line of code `answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])` updates the value of `answer`. It uses the value of `current_cost`, and checks whether `L` is greater than 0 to determine if it should add `dp[i]` to `current_cost`. The value of `dp[i]` is set to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in the range from 0 to 29 and is already defined in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])`.**
