According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values from 0 to n-1, thus it will start from 0. 

Since the other variables (`L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, `dp`, and `c`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself but relate to the context in which the loop is used, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. 

Therefore, the required adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 0**
