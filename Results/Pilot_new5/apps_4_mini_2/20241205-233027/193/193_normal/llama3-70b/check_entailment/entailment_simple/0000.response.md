Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds required to modify an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to a side length `y`, while ensuring that at every moment, the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning each side must be positive and satisfy the triangle inequality).

The provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the necessary adjustments to the sides of the triangle during the transformation process. The triangle must always be in a valid state, where the lengths of the sides must be integers greater than zero at every step.

For instance, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program would output `3`, which is incorrect. To transform `(6, 6, 6)` to `(3, 3, 3)`, the steps would actually require a total of `4` seconds, as shown in the example provided in the problem description.

Since the calculation of `abs(x - y)` does not reflect the correct transformation steps while adhering to the triangle's properties, the program does not meet the problem's requirements. Thus, it is incorrect.
