The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means that after the assignment, `x` and `y` will still satisfy this condition but will take on new integer values provided as input. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers as per the user input, such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
