Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the logic used to count the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. The program simply counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string, which does not accurately reflect the minimum number of operations needed to delete all characters.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aaabb
```
According to the problem, the correct output should be `2` (delete "aaa" in one operation and "bb" in another). However, the provided code would count the transitions from 'a' to 'b' and give the result `3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails for this input, demonstrating that it does not handle the problem correctly in all potential cases.
