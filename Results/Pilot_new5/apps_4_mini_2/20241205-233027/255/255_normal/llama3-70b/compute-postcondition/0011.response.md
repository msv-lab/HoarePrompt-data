The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 2, so the new value of `ans` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500) that is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500) that is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is 2**.
