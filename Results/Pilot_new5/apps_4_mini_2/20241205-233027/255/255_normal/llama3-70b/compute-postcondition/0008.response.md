The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so the new value of `ans` becomes 2. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500) that must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 2**
