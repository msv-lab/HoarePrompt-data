The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, after the increment, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500) that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current character `s[i]` is not equal to the previous character `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500) that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current character `s[i]` is not equal to the previous character `s[i - 1]`.**
