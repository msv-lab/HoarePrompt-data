Given the loop and conditions provided, we can analyze the output state after all iterations have executed.

The loop iterates from `1` to `n - 1`, comparing each character in the string `s` with the previous character. The variable `ans` counts the number of times a change in character occurs.

1. Initially, `ans` is set to `1`, as the first character is counted by default.
2. For each iteration, if the current character `s[i]` is different from the previous character `s[i - 1]`, `ans` is incremented by `1`.

To summarize the final output state:

- If the length of `s` is `n`, then after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will reflect the number of distinct characters in the string.
- The minimum value of `n` for the loop to execute is `2`, and it can execute at most `n-1` times.
- If `n` is `1`, the loop does not execute, thus `ans` remains `1`.

Taking all this into consideration, the output state for the scenario where the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500), `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is the count of distinct adjacent characters in `s`.**
