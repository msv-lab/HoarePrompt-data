The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables remain unaffected, so `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The value of `n` can now be any integer between 1 and 500 based on the input taken. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 500), `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
