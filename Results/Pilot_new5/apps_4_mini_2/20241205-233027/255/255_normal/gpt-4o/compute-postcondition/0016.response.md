Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string (where a transition is defined as a change from one character to a different one) and prints this count. If the string consists of only one unique character, it will print 1, as there are no transitions. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the count of transitions. **
