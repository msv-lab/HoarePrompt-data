The code simply prints 'YES' to the output without modifying any variables. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`, and the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more. The current frequency of `unique_numbers[-1]` is equal to `n // 2`, and the current frequency of `unique_numbers[-2]` is also equal to `n // 2`. Output is 'YES'.**
