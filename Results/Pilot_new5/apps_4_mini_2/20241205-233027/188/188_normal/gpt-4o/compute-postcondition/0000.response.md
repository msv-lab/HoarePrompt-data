The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` was previously an even integer between 2 and 100, after executing this line, `n` will hold the value of the integer received from the input, which is also expected to be an even integer within the same range. The other variables related to `a_i` are not affected yet, as they are only specified to be read in the next `n` lines. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (set to the input integer)**
