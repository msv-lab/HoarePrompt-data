The function accepts an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, followed by `n` integers (each between 1 and 100). It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two unique integers that appear exactly `n/2` times. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' along with those integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle any input errors or unexpected values, assuming the input adheres strictly to the specified constraints.
