The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The states of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` contains the counts of each unique integer in `a`, with keys being the unique integers from `a` and values being their respective counts, `c` is 0**.
