The code assigns the value 1 to the element at index `i` of the list `d`. The value of `i` is the second element of the list `a`, which contains 100 integers input by the user. Therefore, the specific value of `d[i]` is updated to 1, but no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d[i]` is 1.**
