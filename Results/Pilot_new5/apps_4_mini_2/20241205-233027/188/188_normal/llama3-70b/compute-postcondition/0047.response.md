The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`, which represents the next key in the dictionary `d`. The initial values of `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a2`, while preserving the other states.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is preserved (0 or not 0 depending on its value at the end of the last iteration), `a2` is equal to `i`.**
