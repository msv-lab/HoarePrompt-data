The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the next key in dictionary `d` after the current key, but the specific value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `a1` will hold the value of `i`, which is unknown. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key, and `c` is preserved; `a1` is equal to `i`.**
