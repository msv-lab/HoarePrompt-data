According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop will execute again for the next element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `a`. Since `a` contains 100 integers input by the user, to execute one more time, we need to move to the next element in the list.

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 and `i` is the first element of `a`, we need to adjust `i` to the second element of `a`. The loop will continue until all elements of the list are processed.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user.**
