Since `d[i]` is being incremented by 1, we know that `i` is used as an index into the list `d`, which is indirectly related to the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `i` is the third element of `a`, but without knowing the specific value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value getting updated in `d`.

However, we know `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and that `i` holds a value corresponding to the third element of `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `i` is the third element of `a`; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
