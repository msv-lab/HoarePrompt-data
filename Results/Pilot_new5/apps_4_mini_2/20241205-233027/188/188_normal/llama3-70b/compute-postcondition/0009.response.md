The code `d = {}` initializes `d` as an empty dictionary. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `a`, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 99, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, and `d` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 99, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is an empty dictionary.**
