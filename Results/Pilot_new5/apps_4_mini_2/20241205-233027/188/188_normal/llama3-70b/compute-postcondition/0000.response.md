The variable `n` is reassigned the value resulting from `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold an integer value based on user input. The previous state of `n` as an even integer between 2 and 100 is still valid, but its specific value will change based on the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on user input, and it is still an even integer between 2 and 100.**
