The statement `d[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `d` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as the second element of `a`, and `a` contains 100 integers input by the user. The specific value of `d[i]` is not provided, but we know it will be increased by 1. The initial conditions of `n`, `i`, and `a` remain valid, with only `d[i]` being updated.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
