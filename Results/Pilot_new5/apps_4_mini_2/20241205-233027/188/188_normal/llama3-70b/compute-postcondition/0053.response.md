The code contains a print statement which outputs the string 'YES'. This does not affect any variables or their states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged apart from the output being produced. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a1` is the first key in `d` such that `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, `a2` is the second key in `d` such that `d[a2]` equals `n // 2`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 indicating the count of unique integers in `a` that appeared exactly `n // 2` times, `d` is a dictionary containing counts of each unique integer from `a`, and the output 'YES' has been printed.`**
