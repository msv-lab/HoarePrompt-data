The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the first key in dictionary `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `a1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is 0, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2,` and the current value of `c` is 0.**
