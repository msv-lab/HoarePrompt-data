To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The goal is to determine how many spectators are standing at time `t` during a Mexican wave in a stadium with `n` spectators and a maximum of `k` spectators standing at the same time. The pattern of standing and sitting is defined clearly in the description.

1. **For time `t` from 1 to `n`:**
   - The number of standing spectators equals `t` (up to `k`).
   - Thus, if `t <= k`, the output should be `t`.

2. **For time `t` from `n + 1` to `n + k`:**
   - The number of standing spectators stabilizes at `k` from time `n` to `n + k`, and then decreases as spectators begin to sit down. 
   - After `n`, the number of spectators sitting decreases at each step, which depends on how much `t` exceeds `n`.

### Program Analysis
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

1. The first part `min(t, k) if t <= n` correctly implements the rule for `t <= n`.
2. The second part `k - (t - n) % k` is meant to handle cases for `t > n`. Here:
   - It correctly computes how many spectators are sitting based on the excess of `t` over `n`. The expression `(t - n) % k` helps to calculate how many spectators are still standing after reaching `k`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints summarize the code's behavior:
- They confirm that the code computes and prints the minimum of `t` and `k` when `t` is within bounds.
- For `t` beyond `n`, it describes how the function calculates the number of standing spectators, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Values:** For the smallest inputs, such as `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `t = 1`, the output should be `1`, which the code handles correctly.
2. **Boundary Cases:** The transition from when `t = n` to `t = n + 1` should correctly handle that `k` is maintained until we start to see spectators sitting down.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the logic required to count the number of standing spectators under all provided constraints, as verified by checking the outputs against the problem description and considering edge cases. The handling of both `t <= n` and `t > n` cases matches the outlined behavior of the Mexican wave.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case and aligns with the output hints, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
