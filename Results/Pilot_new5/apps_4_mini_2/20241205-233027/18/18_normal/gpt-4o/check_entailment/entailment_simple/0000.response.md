To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation of the `func()` function against the specified requirements of the Mexican wave:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Requirements:**
   - Three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` such that:
     - \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)
     - \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)
     - \( 1 \leq t < n + k \)

2. **Output Requirements:** 
   - The function must output the number of spectators standing at time `t`.

### Spectator Standing Logic:
- For \( t \) values from 1 to \( k \): The number of standing spectators equals \( t \).
- For \( t \) values from \( k + 1 \) to \( n \): The number of standing spectators is constant at \( k \).
- For \( t \) values from \( n + 1 \) to \( n + k - 1 \): The number of standing spectators decreases from \( k \) to \( 0 \), specifically calculated as \( n + k - t \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
```

1. **For \( t \) values \( \leq k \)**:
   - The program correctly prints `t`, which matches the expected output (number of standing spectators).

2. **For \( t \) values \( > k \) and \( \leq n \)**:
   - The program prints `k`, which is also correct since the number of standing spectators is constant at \( k \) during this period.

3. **For \( t \) values \( > n \)**:
   - The program computes `n + k - t`, which correctly decreases the number of standing spectators as per the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully follows the logic defined in the problem description for all relevant conditions. No cases where it fails to meet the output requirements have been identified. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
