Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`, where the constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It prints `t` if `t` is less than or equal to `k`. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates and prints `n + k - t`. There is no return value from the function, and it does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated, such as when `t` is outside the specified range.**
