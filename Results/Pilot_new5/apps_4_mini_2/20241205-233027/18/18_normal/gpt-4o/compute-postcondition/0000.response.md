The code reads input values and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. The initial state indicates that each of these variables is an integer within the specified constraints. The input will provide new integer values for `n`, `k`, and `t` that must still satisfy the original constraints.

Since the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not provided, we can only state that they have been updated from their previous values to new input integers that adhere to the conditions given.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are updated to new integer values from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
