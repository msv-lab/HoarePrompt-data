Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers updated from input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, then `t` is printed. Otherwise, if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, `k` has been printed. If `t` is greater than `n`, then `n`, `k`, and `t` are updated again with the conditions 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`, `t` > `k`, and `t` > `n`, and the output is `n + k - t`.***
