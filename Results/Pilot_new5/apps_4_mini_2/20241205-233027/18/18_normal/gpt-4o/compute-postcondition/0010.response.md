The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`. All three parameters are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The function does not return any output specified in the provided context. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` under specified constraints, but the return value of the function is not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, which are integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The return value of the function is not specified.**
