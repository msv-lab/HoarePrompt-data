According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1 after halving. This means `n` could be 1 or greater. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. Thus, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` remains unchanged**
