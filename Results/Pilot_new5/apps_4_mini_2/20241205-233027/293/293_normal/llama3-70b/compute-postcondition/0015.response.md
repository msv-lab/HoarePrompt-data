The code modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `n // 2 - 1` to its current value. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, but its specific value is not given, so we can only say it is greater than 1. The variable `ans` remains unchanged at the beginning, but its new value will depend on the value of `n`. Since `h` remains unchanged and all constraints still hold, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is greater than 1; `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**
