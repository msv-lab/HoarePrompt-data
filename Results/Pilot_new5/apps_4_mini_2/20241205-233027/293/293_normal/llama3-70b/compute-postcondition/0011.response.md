The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n // 2` will yield a minimum value of 1. The previous values of `h` and `n` remain valid and unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is increased by `n // 2**
