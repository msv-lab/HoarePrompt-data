The code `print(ans)` simply outputs the value of the variable `ans`, and does not modify any variables or change their values. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output is a direct representation of the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `ans` is the sum computed from the iterations based on the initial value of `n`, `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `ans` has been printed.**
