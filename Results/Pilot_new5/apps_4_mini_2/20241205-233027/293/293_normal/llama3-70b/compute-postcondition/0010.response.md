The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1, making `n // 2 - 1` either 0 or negative. The previous state of the variables is not specified, but `ans` will be increased by this computed value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`.**
