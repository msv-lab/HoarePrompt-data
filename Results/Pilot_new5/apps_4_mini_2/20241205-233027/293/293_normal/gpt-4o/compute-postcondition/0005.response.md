The variable `current_level` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`; `current_level` is 0.
