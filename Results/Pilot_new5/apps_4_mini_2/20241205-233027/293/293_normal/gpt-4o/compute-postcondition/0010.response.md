The value of `current_node` is updated by the expression `2 * current_node + 1`. Since the initial value of `current_node` is 0, we can calculate the new value as follows:

`current_node = 2 * 0 + 1 = 1`

The other variables retain their values, so the output state remains the same for those.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, and the value of `direction` is '0'.**
