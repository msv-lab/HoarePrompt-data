The variable `total_leaves` is assigned the value of `2 ** h`, which means it is calculated as 2 raised to the power of the input integer `h`. Given that `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `total_leaves` will be a positive integer, specifically ranging from 2 to 1,125,899,906,842,624 (which is 2^50). 

The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its condition (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h) still holds true.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2 ** h.**
