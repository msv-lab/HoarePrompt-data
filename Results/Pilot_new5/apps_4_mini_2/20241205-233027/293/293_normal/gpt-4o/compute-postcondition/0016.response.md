The value of `current_node` is updated based on the formula `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1`. The previous value of `current_node` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a valid integer from the context. Therefore, without the specific value of `current_node`, we will denote it as `current_node` before the operation. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `current_node` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`.**
