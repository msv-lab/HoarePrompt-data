The initial state has the variable `current_node`, but its value is not explicitly defined. However, assuming `current_node` is initialized and has some value, we can proceed with the update.

The code snippet updates `current_node` as follows: `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2`. This means that `current_node` will be multiplied by 2 and then increased by 2. Since the exact initial value of `current_node` is unknown, we denote its previous value as `current_node` for clarity in the output state.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is equal to `2 * current_node + 2**
