According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. We need to ensure that `2` is still less than or equal to `n // 2`.

Thus, we need `n` to be at least 4 to satisfy the condition `2 ≤ n // 2`, which means `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2**
