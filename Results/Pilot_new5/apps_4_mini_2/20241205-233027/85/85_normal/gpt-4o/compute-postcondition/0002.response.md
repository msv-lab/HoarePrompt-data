According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For this condition to be true, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. Given the constraints, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). 

To satisfy the loop condition:
- \(n + 1\) must be equal to 10, 20, 30, ..., etc. This means \(n\) must be equal to 9, 19, 29, ..., or any number of the form \(10k - 1\) for integer \(k\).

Since we do not have information on the exact value of `n` other than being an integer within the specified range, we need to ensure that `n` is adjusted so that \(n + 1\) is a multiple of 10. The simplest adjustment would be to set `n` to 9, as it is the first possible multiple within the specified range.

Therefore, the required adjustment for the loop to execute is that `n` must be 9.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 0**
