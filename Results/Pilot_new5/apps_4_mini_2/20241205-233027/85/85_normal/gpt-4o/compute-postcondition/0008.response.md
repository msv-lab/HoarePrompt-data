According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `(n + 1)` must be a multiple of 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, making `n + 1` equal to 1. Since 1 is not a multiple of 10, the loop cannot execute again without adjusting the value of `n`. 

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we need `n + 1` to equal 10, which means `n` must be 9. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
