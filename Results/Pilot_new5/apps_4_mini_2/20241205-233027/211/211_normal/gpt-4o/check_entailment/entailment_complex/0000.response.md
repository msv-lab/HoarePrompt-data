Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Case When Total Sum is Zero**: The problem states that if the sum of the array elements is zero, it should print "NO". However, the program checks if the total sum is zero and then incorrectly attempts to create subarrays. If there is at least one non-zero element, it outputs "YES" and two subarrays without confirming that the subarrays themselves also meet the required sum condition (i.e., that their sums are not zero).

2. **Handling All-Zero Arrays**: If all elements in the array are zero, the program correctly prints "NO". This part is correct, but it does not handle cases where the array could contain a mixture of non-zero and zero elements properly.

3. **Subarray Construction**: The program's logic for constructing the subarrays (when the total sum is zero and there are non-zero elements) leads to incorrect outputs. It only checks the first non-zero element, but this does not guarantee that the resulting subarrays will have non-zero sums, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Conditions for Valid Subarrays**: The problem requires all resulting subarrays to have non-zero sums, but the logic in the function does not ensure this condition is met. It simply divides at the first non-zero element, which might still result in subarrays with a total sum of zero.

Given these points, the program fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in the problem description across various potential input cases.
