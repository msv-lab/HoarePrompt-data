The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints the value '1' followed by the result of `i + 1`. Given that `i` was previously set to 0, `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The output of the print statement does not alter the values of any variables, so the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A[0]` is not 0; printed 'YES', printed '2', and printed '1 1'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A[0]` is not 0; printed 'YES', printed '2', and printed '1 1'**.
