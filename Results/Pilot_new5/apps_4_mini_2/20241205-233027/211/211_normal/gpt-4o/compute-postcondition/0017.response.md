The code prints 'YES' to the output, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the new output message.

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and 'YES' is printed.**
