According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. To allow the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
