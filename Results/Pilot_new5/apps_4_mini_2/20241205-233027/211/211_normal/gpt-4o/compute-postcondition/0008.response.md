According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`, and it is specified that `total_sum` is equal to 0. This means that the list `A` must contain integers that sum to 0, which can happen with multiple configurations.

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` is not initialized. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the first index of the range). 

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 0**
