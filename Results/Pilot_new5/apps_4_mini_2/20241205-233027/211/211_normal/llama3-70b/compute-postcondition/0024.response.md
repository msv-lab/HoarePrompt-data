The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the lists `A`, `a`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged. The values of `r` and `l` are also unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` > `n` remains 0; `r` is incremented by 1; `k` is incremented by 1; `l` is unchanged; and `r` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` > `n` remains 0; `r` is incremented by 1; `k` is incremented by 1; `l` is unchanged; `r` is unchanged.**
