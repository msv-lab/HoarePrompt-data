The value of `k` is incremented by 1, meaning that the new value of `k` will now be `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `r` is equal to `n + 1`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `r` is equal to `n + 1`, `k` is now `k + 1`, `l` is equal to `n + 1**.
