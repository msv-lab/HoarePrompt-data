The value of `k` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for k in [1, n] is equal to the sum of the first k elements of `a`, and `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for k > n remains 0; "YES" is printed; `k` is 1.**
