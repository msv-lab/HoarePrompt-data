The value of `n` is assigned the input from the user, which is converted to an integer. The original condition states that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). As a result, after execution, `n` will retain this property, but its specific value will now depend on user input. The list `A` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 based on user input; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 based on user input; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
