To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop code and its effects on the variables.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. On each iteration `i`, the code updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` to be the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and the `i`-th element of the list `a`.

After the loop has executed all `n` times, the final state of the variables will be:

- `prefix_sum[0]` remains 0 (as initialized).
- `prefix_sum[1]` will be equal to `a[0]`.
- `prefix_sum[2]` will be equal to `a[0] + a[1]`.
- ...
- `prefix_sum[n]` will be equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, which is `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]`.
- For `prefix_sum[k]` where `k > n`, those entries remain unchanged at 0.

Thus, after all iterations:
- `prefix_sum` contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` from `0` to `n`, and `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to the total sum of the elements in `a`.

The conditions that must hold true are that `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, each satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for k in [1, n] is equal to the sum of the first k elements of `a`, and `prefix_sum[k]` for k > n remains 0.**
