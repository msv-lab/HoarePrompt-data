Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Output Format**: The problem requires that if it is possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, the output should specify the number of such subarrays and their respective ranges. The program, however, does not properly maintain the output format for the ranges of subarrays. The output format is incorrect because it does not correctly print the boundaries for all valid subarrays as specified.

2. **Handling of Valid Subarrays**: The current logic attempts to find subarrays whose prefix sums are non-zero and not equal to the total sum. However, it does not correctly identify the subarrays. Specifically, it prints the count of non-zero prefix sums but fails to account for valid segments correctly. The output should include segments from `l_i` to `r_i` such that the sum of each segment is non-zero, but the way `k`, `l`, and `r` are managed may lead to incorrect ranges being printed.

3. **Final Subarray Handling**: The program fails to ensure that the last segment is correctly captured in the output. The program prints the last segment from `l` to `n`, but if the last segment is not valid (i.e., if it sums to zero), this will not satisfy the requirement of the output.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not consider cases where the only element in the array is zero (as shown in the third example of the problem description). Thus, it overlooks the fact that a zero total sum should lead to a "NO" output without any further checks.

Due to these reasons, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description, especially regarding output formatting and accuracy in defining subarray boundaries.
