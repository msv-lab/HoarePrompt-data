To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate if the program handles all potential cases correctly.

The problem requires splitting an array into contiguous subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is non-zero. The program first checks if the total sum of the array is non-zero. If so, it outputs that the entire array is one valid subarray. If the total sum is zero, it attempts to find a non-zero element to create at least two subarrays.

Let's analyze the potential edge cases:

1. **Single Element Case**: If the array consists of a single element that is zero, the program correctly outputs "NO".
   
   Input: `1\n0`
   Expected Output: `NO`
   The program does this correctly.

2. **Single Non-Zero Element**: If the array has a single non-zero element, the program should correctly recognize that this single-element array is a valid subarray.
   
   Input: `1\n5`
   Expected Output: 
   ```
   YES
   1
   1 1
   ```
   The program does not handle this case correctly because it would check if the total sum is zero, which it is not, and would output a single subarray covering the entire array, which is valid.

3. **Multiple Elements with Total Zero**: If the array has several elements where the total sum is zero but can be split into non-zero subarrays, the program should correctly find a valid split.
   
   Input: `3\n1 -1 2`
   Expected Output:
   ```
   YES
   2
   1 1
   2 3
   ```
   The program does not handle this case correctly. When the total sum is zero, it will look for a non-zero element, but in this case, it might incorrectly output `NO`.

4. **Multiple Elements with Total Non-Zero**: If the total sum is non-zero, it will correctly take the entire array as a valid subarray.

5. **All Zero Elements**: An edge case where all elements are zero.
   
   Input: `4\n0 0 0 0`
   Expected Output: `NO`
   This is handled correctly since the total sum is zero and all individual checks will yield zero as well.

The critical issue arises when the program assumes that if the total sum is zero, it can only split on finding a non-zero element. There are cases (like the `1 -1 2` example) where despite the total sum being zero, the array can be split into valid non-zero subarrays.

Given these evaluations, the program has cases where it does not function as the problem description requires.

Correctness: **False**.
