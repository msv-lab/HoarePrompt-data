The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
