According to the code, the loop can execute for `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, the next value for `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. The condition states that `n` is at least 2 and at most 1000.

Since `i` is currently 2, and the next iteration will increment `i` by 1, `i` will become 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 (so `n` is at least 4).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, `is_unrated` may be set to True based on the condition with `ratings[i - 1][0]` and `ratings[i][0]`**
