According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 up to `n-1`. The loop variable is a placeholder (underscore `_`), and it does not affect the state directly, but the number of iterations is determined by `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Since the loop has already executed `n` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1. 

However, since `n` is stated to remain unchanged unless `a` is equal to `b`, we maintain its constrained value because the loop condition must adapt accordingly. 

To allow for one more iteration, we assume `n` must now be greater than the previous value, specifically `n + 1`. 

Thus, the state must reflect that `n` is now at least one greater than its previous value.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001, `ratings` contains the tuple (a, b), `is_rated` is True, and `is_unrated` is False if `a` is not equal to `b`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.**
