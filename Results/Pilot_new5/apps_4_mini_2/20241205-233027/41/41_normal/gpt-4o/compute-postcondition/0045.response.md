Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of the form (a, b). If `is_rated` is True, then a message 'rated' is printed and `is_rated` is set to True. If `is_rated` is False and `is_unrated` is True, then 'unrated' is printed and `is_rated` remains False. Otherwise, if both `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are False, then 'maybe' is printed and `is_rated` remains False.***
