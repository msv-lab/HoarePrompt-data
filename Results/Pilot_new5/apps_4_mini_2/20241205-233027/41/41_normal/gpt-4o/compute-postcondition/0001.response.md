The variable `ratings` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list**.
