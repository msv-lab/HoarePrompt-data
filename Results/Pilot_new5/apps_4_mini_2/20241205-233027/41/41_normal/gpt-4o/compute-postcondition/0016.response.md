`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` split into two integers. The state of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`, and `_` remains unchanged. The specific values of `a` and `b` will depend on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1001; `ratings` contains the tuples (a, b) and the new tuple (a, b) has been appended; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `_` is equal to `n`.**
