The `ratings` variable is a tuple that is appended with the new tuple `(a, b)`. This changes the state of `ratings` but does not affect the other variables. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `ratings`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the tuples (a, b) and the new tuple (a, b) has been appended; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False if `a` is not equal to `b`; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
