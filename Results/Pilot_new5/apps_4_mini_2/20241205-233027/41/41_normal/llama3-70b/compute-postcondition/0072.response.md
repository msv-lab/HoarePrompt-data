Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, and `unrated` is `False`. If `unrated` is `False`, it indicates that the conditions were met leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If no break occurs, `unrated` remains `True`, confirming that the conditions were not met for any value of `j` in the range.***
