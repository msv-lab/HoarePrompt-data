In this case, `a` and `b` are assigned values that are provided by user input. The code uses the `map` function to convert the input into two integers. The initial state specifies that `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are both empty lists and `_` represents the last value of `n-1`.

Since the values for `a` and `b` are taken from input, we denote them as input integers. The output state does not affect the other variables since `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged and `_` is still dependent on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list; `_` is n-1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
