The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement that it is contained within. In this case, no variables have their values changed directly by the `break` statement. However, the state of the control flow has changed, indicating that the execution will stop iterating further.

Thus, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we are noting that we have exited the loop or if statement context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
