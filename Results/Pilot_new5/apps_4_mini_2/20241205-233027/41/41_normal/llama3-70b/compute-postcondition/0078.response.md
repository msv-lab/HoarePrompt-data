Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers, `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`, `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`, `rated` is True, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, and `i` is 0 if the first elements of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are different; otherwise, there is no change in the state of variables.***
