To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n):`. 
2. The starting value for `j` is `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 1000`, the loop will execute if `j` starts at 2 and `n` is at least 3 (since range(2, 3) would not execute the loop at all).

Now let's assess the current state:
- `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2, which sets the starting point for `j`.
- `j` starts at 2 and goes up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3.

Thus, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
- Ensure that `n` is at least 3.

Now, summarizing the adjustments:

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**.
