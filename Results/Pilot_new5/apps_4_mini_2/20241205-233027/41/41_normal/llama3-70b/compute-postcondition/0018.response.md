The variable `maybe` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `a` is the last input integer for ratings_before; `b` is the last input integer for ratings_after; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True; `maybe` is True.
