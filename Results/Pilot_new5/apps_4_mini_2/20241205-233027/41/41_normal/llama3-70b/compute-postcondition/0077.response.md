The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or conditional block. However, no variables are modified directly by this statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers, `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`, `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`, `rated` is True, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
