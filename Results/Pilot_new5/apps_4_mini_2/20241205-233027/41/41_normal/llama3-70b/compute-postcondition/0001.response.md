The variable `ratings_before` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged since the code only affects `ratings_before`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, and `ratings_before` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list.**
