Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True. The loop will check the conditions for all pairs of ratings, and if any pair meets the condition leading to a change in `unrated`, the state of `unrated` will be False. If no such pair is found, `unrated` will remain True.**
