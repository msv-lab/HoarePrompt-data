Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True; `i` is 0; `j` is 2. If the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j`, and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
