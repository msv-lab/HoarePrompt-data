The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing this line, `ratings_before` will contain one element: the value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`; `ratings_after` is an empty list; `_` is n-1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
