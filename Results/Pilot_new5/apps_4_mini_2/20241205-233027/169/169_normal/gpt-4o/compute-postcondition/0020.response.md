Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operation` is the second character in `s`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is incremented by 1. If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is decreased by 1 or set to 0. If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then there are no changes to `stones`.***
