The expression `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` calculates the new value of `stones`. Given that `stones` is initially 0, the calculation yields `max(0, 0 - 1)`, which results in `max(0, -1)`. This means that `stones` will remain 0, as it cannot go below zero. 

The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `operation`) retain their previous states since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character of the string `s`, `operation` is not equal to '+', and the current value of `operation` is '-'**
