Correctness: **False**.

The provided program incorrectly handles the situation where the number of operations to take stones ('-') is equal to the number of operations to add stones ('+'). For example, if the input is `4` for operations and the string is `--++`, the program will calculate `plus_count - minus_count`, which equals `0` because there are two `+` and two `-`. However, the minimal possible number of stones after these operations should be `0`, not `2`, as Vasya could start with zero stones and still perform the operations correctly.

In another case, say `n = 5` and `s = "+-+-+"`, the program will output `2` (3 `+` and 2 `-`), which is also incorrect. The minimum possible stones after these operations should account for the fact that Vasya could have started with zero stones and still performed the operations.

Thus, the program does not correctly account for all potential cases, which leads to its classification as incorrect.
