Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases dictated by the problem description. Specifically, the logic fails to maintain the necessary initial stones required to ensure that there are enough stones in the pile before each operation of taking one stone.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
----- 
```
In this case, the program would start with `stones = 0` and attempt to perform 5 operations of taking stones (`-`), which is not allowed. The initial condition states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking a stone, thus it would be impossible to perform these operations without starting with at least 5 stones. As a result, the program would incorrectly output `0` when it should not be able to perform these operations at all.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem constraints and is incorrect.
