The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, based on the constraints mentioned, it seems to imply that `n` and `k` are expected to be provided in some context (perhaps as global variables or through some other means). 

Given the constraints:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\).

We will assume that the function processes these two values, `n` and `k`, even though they are not directly passed as parameters in the function definition.

Unfortunately, the output or behavior of the function is not specified in your request. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns or how it utilizes the parameters `n` and `k`.

Based on the provided constraints, we can summarize the following about the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: n, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and k, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). The specific behavior regarding the output or return value of the function is not specified.**
