The value of `i` is increased by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is incremented. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is at least 1, `a` now contains the value `x` appended to it, and `n` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is at least 1, `a` now contains the value `x` appended to it, and `n` is `n - 2.**
