The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The value of `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 0 after it was updated to be greater than or equal to 0, but it remains unchanged by the operation on `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is increased by 1**
