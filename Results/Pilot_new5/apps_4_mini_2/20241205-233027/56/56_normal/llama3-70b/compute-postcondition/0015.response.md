The variable `x` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which is at least 2 for `n` being 2 or greater. Therefore, `n.bit_length()` will be at least 2 and thus `x` will be at least 1. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but it is not specified how much it was increased. Therefore, the output state retains the requirement on `n` and indicates that `i` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is at least 1 (specifically `n.bit_length() - 1`).**
