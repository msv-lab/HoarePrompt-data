You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. The value of `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` from 0 to 60, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` has no set bits, `bits` remains an empty list.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` from 0 to 60, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` has no set bits, `bits` remains an empty list.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `bits` contains the original indices of the set bits in `n`, with `smallest - 1` appended multiple times until the length of `bits` equals `k`, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final length of `bits`, and `len(bits)` is equal to `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the joined string representation of the elements in 'bits', which is sorted in descending order, where 'bits' has a length equal to 'k'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, returning 'No' if `k` exceeds `n` or if there are more set bits in `n` than `k`. If there are fewer set bits than `k`, it adjusts the bits to reach a length of `k`, and then returns 'Yes' followed by the indices in sorted order.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
