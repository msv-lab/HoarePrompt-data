The value of `smallest` is assigned as the last element of the original `bits`. The last element of `bits` is now `smallest - 1`, which indicates that `bits` previously contained indices of set bits in `n`, and now it appends `smallest - 1`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits in `n` without the last element plus the new last element `smallest - 1`; `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer greater than `len(bits)`.**
