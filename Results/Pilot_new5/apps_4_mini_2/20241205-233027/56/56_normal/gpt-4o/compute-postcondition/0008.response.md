According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is within the range specified in the `range(60, -1, -1)`, which starts from 60 and decreases to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 60 (the first value in the range). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 59 in the next iteration. 

The variable `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop. The state of `k` and `bits` also remains the same, as they are not affected by the for loop iteration in the provided code context.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the values must be updated as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, and `bits` is an empty list. `i` is 59.**
