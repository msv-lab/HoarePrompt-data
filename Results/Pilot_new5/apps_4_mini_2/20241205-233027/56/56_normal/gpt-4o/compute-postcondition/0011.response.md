According to the code, the loop iterates from 60 down to 0, which means it will execute a total of 61 times (for `i` values of 60, 59, 58, ..., down to 0). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be at 0, which is the final value of `i` for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the range specified in the for-loop. 

The loop is defined to decrement `i` from 60 to -1, so after the last iteration where `i` is 0, the next value of `i` will be -1, which is when the loop will terminate. The loop cannot continue to execute once `i` goes below 0, so it will not execute one more time unless we redefine the range or the starting point.

Therefore, the next state for `i` would be -1 after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, bits remains unchanged, `i` is -1**
