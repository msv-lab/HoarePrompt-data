The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. 

- Case 1: If the current value of `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: There is another condition that also results in a return value of 'No'.
- Case 3: If neither of the previous cases apply, the function returns 'Yes' followed by the joined string representation of the elements in 'bits', which is sorted in descending order, where 'bits' has a length equal to `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the values of these parameters, it returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a sorted string representation of certain elements.
