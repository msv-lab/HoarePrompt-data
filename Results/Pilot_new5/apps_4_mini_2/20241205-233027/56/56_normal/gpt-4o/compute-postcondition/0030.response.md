Output State: **`bits` contains the original indices of the set bits in `n`, with `smallest - 1` appended multiple times until the length of `bits` equals `k`, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final length of `bits`, and `len(bits)` is equal to `k`.**
