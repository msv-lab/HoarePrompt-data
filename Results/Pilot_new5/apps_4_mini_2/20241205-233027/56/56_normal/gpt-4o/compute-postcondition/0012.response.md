The code `bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. The variable `i` has the value of -1. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `bits` will now include the value -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `i` is -1, and bits now includes -1.**
