The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer in the range 1 to \(10^{18}\), and `k`, a positive integer in the range 1 to \(10^5\). The functionality of the function is as follows:

1. **Initial Check**: If `k` is greater than `n`, the function immediately returns 'No'. This is a critical edge case since the maximum number of distinct bits that can be represented in `n` is limited by its value.

2. **Collecting Set Bits**: The function collects the indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`. The bits are stored in the list `bits`.

3. **Second Check**: If the number of set bits (length of `bits`) is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'. This indicates that the function cannot meet the requirement of producing `k` elements based on the bits available.

4. **Adjusting Bits**: If there are fewer set bits than `k`, the function enters a loop where it pops the smallest bit index from `bits`, reduces it by one, and appends this value twice to `bits` until the length of `bits` equals `k`. This effectively tries to pad the list with smaller indices.

5. **Final Output**: Once the length of `bits` equals `k`, the function sorts `bits` in descending order and returns 'Yes' followed by the string representation of the elements in `bits`.

The possible outcomes of the function are:
- It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the initial set bits in `n` are more than `k`.
- It returns 'Yes' followed by a sorted list of `k` bit indices if the conditions allow.

Thus, the function is designed to determine whether it is possible to produce exactly `k` bit indices based on the binary representation of `n`, while handling specific edge cases regarding the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, returning 'No' if `k` exceeds `n` or if there are more set bits in `n` than `k`. If there are fewer set bits than `k`, it adjusts the bits to reach a length of `k`, and then returns 'Yes' followed by the indices in sorted order. **
