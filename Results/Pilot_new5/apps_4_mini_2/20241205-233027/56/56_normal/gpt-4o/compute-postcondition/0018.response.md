To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `len(bits) < k`. The loop will execute if the length of `bits` is less than `k`.

Given the constraints:
- `bits` contains the indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\).
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.

Since `bits` can be empty (if `n` has no set bits), we need to ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k` for the loop to execute. 

In the worst-case scenario, if `n` is a positive integer with no set bits, `bits` would be an empty list (`len(bits) = 0`), which satisfies the condition `0 < k` for any valid `k` (greater than or equal to 1). Hence, the loop would execute.

However, if `len(bits)` were to equal `k`, then the loop would not execute. Therefore, to guarantee that the loop executes at least once, we can ensure that `len(bits)` is strictly less than `k`, which can be achieved by adjusting `k` to be greater than `len(bits)`.

In conclusion, since `bits` can be empty when `n` has no set bits, we don't need to modify any existing states. The condition `len(bits) < k` can naturally be satisfied as long as `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits in `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a positive integer, ensuring that `k` is greater than `len(bits)`**.
