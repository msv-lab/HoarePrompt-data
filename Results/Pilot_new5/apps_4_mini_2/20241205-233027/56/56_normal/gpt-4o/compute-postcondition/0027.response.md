`smallest` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `bits`, which is removed from the list using the `pop()` method. As a result, `bits` now contains all its previous elements except the one that was last. The values of `n` and `k`, as well as the condition that `len(bits)` is less than `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bits` is a list excluding the last element, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than `len(bits)`, and `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

Output State: **`bits` is a list excluding the last element, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than `len(bits)`, and `len(bits)` is less than `k`.**
