Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It starts by reading the weights of Limak and Bob, and then it uses a while loop to simulate the weight changes year by year, updating Limak's weight by tripling it and Bob's weight by doubling it. The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point it counts the number of years that have passed.

All edge cases mentioned in the problem description are handled correctly:

1. If Limak starts with a weight equal to Bob (the minimum allowed input), the program will correctly find that Limak becomes heavier after one year.
2. The logic of tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight is accurately reflected in the loop, ensuring that the weights are updated properly.
3. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will efficiently compute the number of years required for Limak to surpass Bob's weight without any risk of overflow or performance issues.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem requirements for all potential cases.
