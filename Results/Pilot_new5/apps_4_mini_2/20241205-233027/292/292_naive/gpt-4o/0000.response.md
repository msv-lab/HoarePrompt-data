Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes the weights of Limak and Bob as input and simulates the weight changes over the years. Specifically, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, with a counter for the number of years. 

The sample inputs provided in the problem statement align with the program's behavior:

1. For input `4 7`, the weights after 2 years (12 and 14, then 36 and 28) correctly shows Limak becoming heavier after 2 years.
2. For input `4 9`, the weights after 3 years (12 and 18, then 36 and 36, finally 108 and 72) show Limak becoming heavier after 3 years.
3. For input `1 1`, Limak becomes heavier after the first year (3 and 2).

Given that the program handles the edge cases and all potential scenarios outlined in the problem description, it is correct.
