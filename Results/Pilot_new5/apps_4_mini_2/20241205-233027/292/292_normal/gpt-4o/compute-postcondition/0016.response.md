The function `func` accepts parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, where `a` represents Limak's weight and `b` represents Bob's weight. The function does not return any specific output based on these parameters as the output section is missing. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively, adhering to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is Limak's weight and `b` is Bob's weight, both integers constrained by 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.**
