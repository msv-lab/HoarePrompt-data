The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input and converts it into two integers. The initial conditions state that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. After executing the code, `a` and `b` will take on the specific values provided via input.

Since the specific input values are not provided, we can only state that `a` will still be an integer between 1 and `b`, and `b` will be an integer between `a` and 10.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, where `a` and `b` are now the integers input by the user.**
