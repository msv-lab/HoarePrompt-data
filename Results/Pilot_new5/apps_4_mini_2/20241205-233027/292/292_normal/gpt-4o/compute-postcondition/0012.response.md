The variable `b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` must be greater than 3 and is capped at 20, the new value of `b` will be between 8 and 40 after the multiplication. The variable `a` remains unchanged, but since it is defined as an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, the range for `a` will also change based on the new value of `b`. 

If `b` was previously 4, then after the operation `b` will be 8, and `a` has to be between 9 and 72. If `b` was previously 20, then after the operation `b` will be 40, and `a` will be between 9 and 360.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, `b` is now between 8 and 40 (b must be greater than 3 and capped at 20).**
