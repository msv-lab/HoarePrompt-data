According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop can execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Right before the loop, `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, and `b` is an integer between `a` and 10. Since `a` is already less than or equal to `b` (as `b` is greater than or equal to `a`), the loop can execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, `years` is 0**
