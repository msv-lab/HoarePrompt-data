The value of `years` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `years` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value. The other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unchanged based on the provided information. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer between 3 and `3 * b`, `b` is either in the range [2a, 20] or is capped at 20, and `years` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3 * b`, `b` is either in the range [2a, 20] or is capped at 20, `years` has increased by 1.**
