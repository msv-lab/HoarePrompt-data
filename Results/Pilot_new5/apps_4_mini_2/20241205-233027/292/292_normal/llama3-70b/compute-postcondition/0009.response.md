The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is 1, so after the execution, `years` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unaffected, maintaining their previous conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer equal to the previous value multiplied by 3, `b` is greater than the previous value of `b` doubled, and `years` is now 2 with the conditions 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 20 still valid.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the previous value multiplied by 3, `b` is greater than the previous value of `b` doubled, `years` is 2, and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 20 remain valid.**
