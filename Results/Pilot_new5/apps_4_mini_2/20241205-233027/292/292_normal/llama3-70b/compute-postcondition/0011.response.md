The value of `a` is multiplied by 3, which directly changes its value. Given that `a` is initially an integer equal to its previous value multiplied by 3, after the operation `a *= 3`, `a` will now be equal to the previous value of `a` multiplied by 3 again, resulting in `a` being multiplied by 9 in total. The variable `b` remains unchanged, but it must still satisfy the condition of being at least equal to `a`. 

The variables `years` and the condition regarding `b` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the operation. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to its previous value multiplied by 9; `b` is greater than the previous value of `b` doubled; `years` is 2; and `b` must be at least equal to `a`.**
