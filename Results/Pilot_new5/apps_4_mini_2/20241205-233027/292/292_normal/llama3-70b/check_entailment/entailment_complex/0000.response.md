The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It reads two integers representing the weights of Limak and Bob, then simulates the passing of years while Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled. The program counts the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `years` to 0 and reads the weights `a` and `b` from the input. This aligns with the problem description that requires tracking the time until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues while Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`), which is exactly what the problem states: Limak wants to become strictly heavier than Bob. 

3. **Weight Update**: Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`). This is consistent with the problem description where Limak's weight increases by a factor of 3 each year and Bob's by a factor of 2.

4. **Year Count**: The `years` variable is incremented with each iteration, accurately counting the number of years that have passed until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of years when Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, which matches the requirement of the problem description.

6. **Constraints Handling**: The program correctly accounts for the constraints given (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), ensuring that it will always work within the specified limits and will terminate as expected.

The implementation meets all the specified requirements and correctly handles all potential edge cases described in the examples provided.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
