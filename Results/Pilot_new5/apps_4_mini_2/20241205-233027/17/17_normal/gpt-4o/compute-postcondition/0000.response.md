The variable `cnt1` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that must be a non-negative integer. The initial state includes the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, which are non-negative integers, but we do not change their values in this execution. 

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input.**
