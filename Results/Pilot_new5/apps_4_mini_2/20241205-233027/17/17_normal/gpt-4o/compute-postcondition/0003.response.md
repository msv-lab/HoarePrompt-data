The value of `cnt4` is assigned the value from `input`, which is converted to an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer.**
