Postcondition: ***`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer. It is not the case that `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4`, or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`.***
