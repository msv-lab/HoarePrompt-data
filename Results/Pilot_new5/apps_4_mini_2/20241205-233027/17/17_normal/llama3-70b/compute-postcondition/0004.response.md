The code simply prints the integer `1`. There are no changes to any of the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, or `cnt_4`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of the input integers.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are input integers. `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`.**
