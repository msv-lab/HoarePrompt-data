The `print(0)` statement outputs the integer `0` to the console but does not modify any variables or affect their values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The only action taken is displaying the value `0`.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer, the current value of `cnt_3` is greater than `cnt_1`, and 0 has been printed to the console.**
