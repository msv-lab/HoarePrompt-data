To determine the correctness of the given program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input:** Three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) (where \( x \) is the number of upvotes, \( y \) is the number of downvotes, and \( z \) is the number of uncertain votes).
2. **Output Rules:** 
   - Print "+" if there are more upvotes than downvotes for all configurations of uncertain votes.
   - Print "-" if there are more downvotes than upvotes for all configurations of uncertain votes.
   - Print "0" if the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes for all configurations with no uncertain votes.
   - Print "?" if there is uncertainty, meaning that the results could vary based on how the uncertain votes are cast.

### Program Logic:
1. If \( x > y + z \): The program outputs '+' because even in the worst-case scenario (all uncertain votes are downvotes), upvotes exceed downvotes.
2. If \( x < y \): The program outputs '-' because even with all uncertain votes being upvotes, downvotes still exceed upvotes.
3. If \( x == y \):
   - If \( z == 0 \): The program outputs '0' since there are no uncertain votes and the votes are tied.
   - If \( z > 0 \): The program outputs '?' because uncertain votes could lead to more upvotes or downvotes.
4. If \( x > y \) and \( x < y + z \): The program outputs '?' because the outcome could change based on the distribution of uncertain votes.

### Conclusion on Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all conditions specified in the problem description.
- Each output condition has been accounted for:
  - "+" is printed when \( x \) is definitively greater than all possible downvotes.
  - "-" is printed when downvotes are always greater than upvotes.
  - "0" is printed when votes are tied with no uncertain votes.
  - "?" is printed when there is uncertainty due to the presence of uncertain votes.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
