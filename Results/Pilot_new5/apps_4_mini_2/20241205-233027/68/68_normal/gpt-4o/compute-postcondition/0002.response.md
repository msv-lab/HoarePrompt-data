The code assigns the value of `max_upvotes` to `x + z`. The value of `x` is already defined as `min_upvotes`, so `max_upvotes` will be equal to `min_upvotes + z`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains the same, but `max_upvotes` is updated.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
