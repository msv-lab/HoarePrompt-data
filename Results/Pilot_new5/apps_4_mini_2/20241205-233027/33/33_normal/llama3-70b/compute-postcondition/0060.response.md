Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, adjusted based on the inputs processed during the loop iterations; `t` is an integer representing the last valid input value converted from the input; if `curr_lat` reaches -90, the last direction must be 'North' to maintain it; if `curr_lat` reaches 90, the last direction must be 'South' to maintain it.**
