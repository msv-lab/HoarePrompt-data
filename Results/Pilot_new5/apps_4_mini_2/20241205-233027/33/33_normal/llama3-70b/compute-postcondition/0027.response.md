The code `t, dir = input().split()` will take an input string and split it into two parts. The variables `t` and `dir` will be assigned the values from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1, but it does not directly affect the assignment of `t` and `dir`.

Since the values of `t` and `dir` are not specified in the initial state and will depend on user input, we cannot assume specific values for them. Thus, we present the output state with the information about `n`, along with the new variables `t` and `dir` as inputs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` and `dir` are input values split from the user input.**
