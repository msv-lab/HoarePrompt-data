According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. The variable `curr_lat` being 90 does not affect the execution of the loop, as it is not used in the loop control. 

Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer within the valid range, we can conclude that the loop can execute. Moreover, since the loop variable is indicated as `_`, it does not require specific initialization.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed:
- `n` is valid and within the range.
- The loop will execute 0 times as it is not associated with a specific variable.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
