The statement `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` modifies the value of `curr_lat` by subtracting the result of `t / 111.195` from it. The variable `t` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2.
- `t` is an integer (specific value not given).
- `dir` is the second part of input (specific value not given).

The impact of the code is that `curr_lat` will be decreased by the value of `t / 111.195`. Since we do not have a specific value for `curr_lat` or `t`, we can only indicate that it has changed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the second part of input; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.**
