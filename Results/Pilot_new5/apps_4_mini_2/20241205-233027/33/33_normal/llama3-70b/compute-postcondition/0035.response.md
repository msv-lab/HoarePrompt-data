The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program. No variables are changed, but the program will cease to continue running beyond this point. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South'; 'NO' is printed and the program exits.
