Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, then `curr_lat` remains 90 and the program has exited. If `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the program continues without changes to `curr_lat`. The current value of `curr_lat` is -90, and `dir` is not 'North'.***
