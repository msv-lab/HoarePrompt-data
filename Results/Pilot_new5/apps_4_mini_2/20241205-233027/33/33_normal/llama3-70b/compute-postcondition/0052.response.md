The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no variables are changed, and the program will not proceed to any further steps. The output will indicate that the program has exited without any changes to the variables, but the print statement 'NO' is rendered irrelevant since the program terminates before it could execute.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; the program has exited and 'NO' is rendered irrelevant.**
