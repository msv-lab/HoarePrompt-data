Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is not 'South', the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
