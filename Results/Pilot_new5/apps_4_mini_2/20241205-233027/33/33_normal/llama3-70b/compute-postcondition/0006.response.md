The variable `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its previous value. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, and `t` is an input integer. The new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 + t / 111.195, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is 'North'**.
