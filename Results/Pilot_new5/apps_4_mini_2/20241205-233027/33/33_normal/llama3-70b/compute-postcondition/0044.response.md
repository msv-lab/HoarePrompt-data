The input function is called to accept a string input, which is then split into two variables, `t` and `dir`. The variable `n` remains unchanged in value but is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is the first part of input, `dir` is the second part of input.**
