The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop execution, and thus 'NO' has been printed before the exit is initiated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `curr_lat` is equal to -90; `dir` is not 'North'; 'NO' is printed and the program exits.
