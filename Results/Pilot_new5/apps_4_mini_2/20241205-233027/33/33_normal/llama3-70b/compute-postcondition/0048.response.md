The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` are defined but not modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `dir` but indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop is continuing without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the second part of input and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
