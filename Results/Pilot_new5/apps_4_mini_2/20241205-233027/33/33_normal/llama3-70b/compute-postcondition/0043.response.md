According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition defined by the variable `n` holds true. Since `n` is given as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1, the loop can execute a total of `n` times.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, and the loop has executed a certain number of times, but we don't know how many iterations have already been completed yet.

For the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that the loop counter (represented by `_` in this case) does not exceed `n`. Therefore, if the loop has already executed `k` times, then `k` must be less than `n`. After the next iteration, this counter would become `k + 1`.

Since we do not have information on the current count of executed iterations, we can only state that to allow for one more execution, `n` must remain greater than `k + 1`. 

Thus, to summarize the state necessary for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2**
