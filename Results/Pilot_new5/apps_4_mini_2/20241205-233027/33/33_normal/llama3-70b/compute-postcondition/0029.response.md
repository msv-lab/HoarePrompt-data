The value of `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer value converted from input, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `curr_lat` will be updated based on the value of `t`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`.**
