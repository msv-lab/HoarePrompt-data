The function accepts a number of directional inputs and distance values, processing them to adjust a latitude value starting from 90 degrees. It checks to ensure that the latitude does not exceed the range of -90 to 90 degrees based on the input directions ('North' or 'South'). If the latitude reaches -90, the last direction must be 'North', and if it reaches 90, the last direction must be 'South'. If any of these conditions are violated, the function outputs 'NO'. After processing all inputs, it prints 'YES' if the final latitude is exactly 90; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
