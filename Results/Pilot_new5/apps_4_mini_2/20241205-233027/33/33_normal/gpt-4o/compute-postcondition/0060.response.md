Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50; `position` is a value between 0 and 20000; `valid` is a boolean indicating whether all movements were valid based on the conditions within the loop; `t` is the last integer input received, and `dir` is the last directional input received. If at any point `position` went below 0 or above 20000, or if any invalid movement was attempted, `valid` will be False; otherwise, it remains True. If the loop does not execute, `position` remains 0 and `valid` is True.**
