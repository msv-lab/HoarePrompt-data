Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is set to `t` and `valid` is set to False. Otherwise, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False if `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', the value of `t` remains an input integer, and `dir` is a string that is not equal to 'North' or 'South'.***
