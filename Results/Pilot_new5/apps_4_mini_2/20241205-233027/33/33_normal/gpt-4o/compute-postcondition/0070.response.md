Functionality: ** The function reads a number of directional movements and calculates a final position based on these movements. It validates that the movements do not exceed certain bounds (0 to 20000) and checks if the final position is zero after all movements. If all movements are valid and the final position is 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters and expects user input for the number of movements and their details. It also checks for invalid movements, such as moving beyond the specified limits or attempting to move West or East when at the edges of the valid range. **
