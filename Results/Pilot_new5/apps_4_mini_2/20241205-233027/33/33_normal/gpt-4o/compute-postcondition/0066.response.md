Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50; `position` is 0; `valid` is True; `t` is the last integer input received; `dir` is the last directional input received. This indicates that no movements occurred leading to the current value of `position`, and all movements, if any, were valid since the loop did not execute.***
