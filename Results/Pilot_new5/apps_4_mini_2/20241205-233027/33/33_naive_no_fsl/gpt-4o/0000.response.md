Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is a specific case that demonstrates the issue:

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
5000 North
10000 West
```

### Explanation of the Case:
1. Limak starts at the North Pole (position 0).
2. The first instruction is to move 20000 kilometers South. This brings Limak to the South Pole (position 20000).
3. The second instruction is to move 5000 kilometers North. This would bring Limak to position 15000, which is valid.
4. The third instruction is to move 10000 kilometers West. However, once Limak is at the South Pole, he cannot move in any direction other than North. The program should validate this condition and return "NO", but it will incorrectly return "YES" because the check for invalid movement in the West direction happens after the position is checked.

Thus, the program fails to enforce the rule that Limak can only move North from the South Pole, leading to incorrect behavior. The conditions outlined in the problem statement are not fully met by the implementation, resulting in an incorrect conclusion.
