To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and assess whether it handles all specified conditions effectively.

### Key Conditions from the Problem Description:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (lat = 90), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (lat = -90), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole (lat = 90).

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program keeps track of Limak's current latitude (`curr_lat`), initialized to 90 (North Pole).
- For each movement, it reads the distance and direction, adjusts `curr_lat` accordingly:
  - Moves North increase `curr_lat`.
  - Moves South decrease `curr_lat`.
- After adjusting `curr_lat`, it checks:
  - If `curr_lat` goes beyond the limits (-90 or 90), it prints "NO".
  - If at -90 (South Pole) and the direction is not North, it prints "NO".
  - If at 90 (North Pole) and the direction is not South, it prints "NO".
- Finally, it checks if `curr_lat` is back to 90 (North Pole) after all movements to print "YES" or "NO".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Movement in East or West**:
   - The program implicitly allows for East or West movements by using `continue` in the else clause. However, such movements are not recognized as valid transitions when Limak is at the poles. There is no direct handling for East/West directions at either pole. 
   - If Limak were to attempt to move East or West while at the North Pole, the logic allows this without printing "NO", which violates the rules outlined in the problem description.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
10000 South
10000 East
5000 North
```
- After moving South 10,000 km, Limak will be at 90 - (10000/111.195) ≈ 10.5 latitude.
- Moving East from there is arbitrary and does not adjust `curr_lat`.
- After moving East, then moving North 5,000 km does not ensure Limak returns to the North Pole; he may end up at lat = 10.5 + (5000/111.195) ≈ 54.5. 
- Since Limak did not move back to the North Pole, the output should be "NO", but since there is no check for East movement at any pole, it will likely not trigger the correct "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles East and West movements, particularly at the poles. Therefore, it does not meet all the specified requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
