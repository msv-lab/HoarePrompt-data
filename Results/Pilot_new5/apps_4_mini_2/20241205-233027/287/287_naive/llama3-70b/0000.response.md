Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not meet the problem description requirements. The problem is to determine the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \), but the program instead counts the number of divisors of \( n \).

For example, when \( n = 7 \), the expected output is 4 (as there are four weights of splits: 1, 2, 3, and 7). However, the program will output 4 correctly since \( 7 \) is prime and has two divisors (1 and 7), but it does not calculate the weights of the splits at all.

A specific case where the program fails is when \( n = 9 \). The expected output is 5 (for weights: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), but the program will output 3 since it only counts the divisors (1, 3, and 9).

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the required output based on the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
