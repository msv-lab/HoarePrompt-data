The code snippet `print(res)` outputs the current value of `res`, which is equal to the total number of divisors of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as only printing occurs without any modification to the variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` retains its value, which is the total number of divisors of `n`. 

Output State: **`res` is equal to the total number of divisors of `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9.**
