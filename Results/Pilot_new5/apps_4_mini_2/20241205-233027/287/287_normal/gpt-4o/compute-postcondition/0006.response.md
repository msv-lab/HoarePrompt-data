The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` was 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i` (num % i == 0), and `i` is not equal to num // i.

Output State: **`num` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, the current value of `num` is divisible by `i` (num % i == 0), and `i` is not equal to num // i.**
