`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so after executing the code, `count` will be 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 4, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i` (num % i == 0).

Output State: **`num` must be at least 4, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i` (num % i == 0).**
