The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it starts at 1, so after the increment, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, and `i` is now 2.

Output State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 2**
