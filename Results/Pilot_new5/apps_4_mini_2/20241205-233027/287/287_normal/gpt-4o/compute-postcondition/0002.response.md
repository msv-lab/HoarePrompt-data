According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The condition for the loop to execute is `i * i <= num`. Currently, `i` is 1, which means `i * i` is 1. To ensure that the loop can execute, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which it is, since it is given to be between 1 and 10^9). 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i * i` is less than or equal to `num` at least once more. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again after the first iteration, `num` must be at least 4 (so that `i` can be incremented to 2 and `i * i` will then be 4).

Therefore, the current value of `num` should be adjusted so that it is at least 4.

State: **`num` must be at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
