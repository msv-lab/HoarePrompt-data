To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= num`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `num` is at least 4
- `count` is 0
- `i` is 2

Now, we need to check the current state against the loop condition:
- Currently, `i` is 2. Therefore, `i * i` equals 4.
- Since `num` is at least 4, it is possible that `i * i` is less than or equal to `num`, allowing the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can proceed for at least one more iteration:
- If `num` is exactly 4, then `i * i` (which is 4) meets the condition `i * i <= num`, allowing the loop to run again.
- If `num` is greater than 4, the condition is also satisfied.

Therefore, `num` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to run one more time, as it is already sufficient for the current state of `i`.

State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 2**
