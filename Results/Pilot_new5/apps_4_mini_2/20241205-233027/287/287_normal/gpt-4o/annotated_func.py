#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is \( \lfloor \sqrt{num} \rfloor + 1 \), `count` is the number of divisors of the original value of `num`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of divisors of the original value of `num`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` (where 1 <= num <= 10^9) and returns the total count of divisors of `num`. It correctly counts both the divisor pairs and handles cases where `num` is a perfect square to avoid double-counting.
