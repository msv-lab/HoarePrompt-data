The problem description specifies that we need to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to \( n \). The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

The provided program, however, does not implement the required logic to compute the weights of the splits. Instead, it calculates the number of divisors of the integer \( n \). This does not correspond to the problem's requirement, as the weights of splits are not directly related to the number of divisors of a number.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function `func_1(num)` computes the number of divisors of `num`, counting pairs of divisors while ensuring that perfect squares do not count the square root twice.
2. There is no logic in the code to generate splits or to calculate the weights of those splits, as specified in the problem description.
3. The output hints confirm that the function is counting divisors, which does not relate to the problem of splits and their weights.

### Edge Cases:
- When \( n = 1 \), the only split is \([1]\), which has a weight of \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the splits are \([2]\) and \([1,1]\), which have weights of \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) respectively.
- For larger values of \( n \), the pattern of calculating splits and their weights diverges from merely counting divisors.

### Conclusion:
Since the code does not address the problem at all and is calculating something entirely different (the number of divisors), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
