Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the annotated program defines a function `func_1` that instead counts the number of divisors of the integer \( n \).

To illustrate the discrepancy, let's analyze the two critical components:
1. The problem states that we need to determine the number of different weights of splits of \( n \). The weights are defined by how many times the first element of the split appears in the sequence.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) instead of counting the weights of splits. For instance, the weights are related to the ways in which \( n \) can be expressed as sums of distinct integers, not its divisors.

As a counterexample, consider \( n = 7 \):
- The program, by counting the divisors, would return 4, which is incorrect in the context of the problem since the actual weights of splits of 7 are 1, 2, 3, and 7, resulting in 4 different weights.
- However, the logic behind calculating weights is different from counting divisors, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.

Therefore, since the program does not implement the correct logic to address the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits, we conclude that it does not fulfill the requirements specified.
