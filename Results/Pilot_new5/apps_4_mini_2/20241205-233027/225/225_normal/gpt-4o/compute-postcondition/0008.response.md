According to the code, the loop iterates through the string `s` based on its length, which is determined by `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, the character at index `i` of `s` is a vowel, which means `prev_pos` is updated to 0 and `i` remains 0. 

Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 1 on the next iteration. To continue executing the loop, `i` must remain less than `len(s)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the updated values should reflect that `i` is now 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, and `i` is 1**
