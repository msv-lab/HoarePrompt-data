Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, and `last_vowel` is 0 if `s[1]` is a vowel; otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1. If `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 2). If `last_vowel` is 0, `max_jump` remains unchanged; if `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is either unchanged or set to 1 or 2 depending on the value of `last_vowel`.***
