The code assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Since `i` is 2, `last_vowel` will now be equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2.**
