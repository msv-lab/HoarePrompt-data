According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is positive. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty string, and the value of `last_vowel` will depend on whether `s[i]` (which will be `s[1]` in the next iteration) is a vowel or not. If `s[1]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` will be set to 0, and `max_jump` will be set to 1. If `s[1]` is not a vowel, `last_vowel` will remain -1, and `max_jump` will remain unchanged.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0 if `s[1]` is a vowel; otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` is unchanged.**
