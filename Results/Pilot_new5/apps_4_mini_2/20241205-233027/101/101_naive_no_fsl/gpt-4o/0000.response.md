To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and conditions under which it operates based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of the pixels.

2. **Finding the Boundaries**:
   - The nested loop correctly identifies the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels ('w'). 
   - If there are no white pixels, it returns -1, which is also correct.

3. **Frame Size Check**:
   - The program checks if the height (`frame_height`) and width (`frame_width`) are less than 2. If they are, it returns -1. This is problematic because:
     - If the width or height is exactly 2, a frame should still be possible. 

4. **Constructing the Frame**:
   - The program constructs the frame by replacing the appropriate positions in the `result` matrix with '+'.
   - However, it does not account for cases where the frame needs to be placed around a single 'w' pixel or when the frame is supposed to include adjacent white pixels without needing a full 2-pixel width.

### Identification of Edge Cases:

Let's analyze cases where the program might not work correctly:

- **Case 1**: 
  Input:
  ```
  3 3
  w.w
  ...
  w.w
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  w+w
  +++
  w+w
  ```
  The expected frame includes the 'w' at (0,0) and (2,0) with the frame expanding around both. The program may incorrectly identify the frame size and return -1.

- **Case 2**:
  Input:
  ```
  1 1
  w
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  w
  ```
  The program should handle single pixel cases correctly. The current implementation would return -1.

### Conclusion:
Since we have identified potential cases where the program does not satisfy the problem requirements, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
