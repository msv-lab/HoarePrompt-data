The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is defined as `k + 2`, and since `k` is not provided in the initial state, `j` remains an unknown integer that influences the value of `right`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `screen` remain unchanged during this operation, as there is no condition in the code that modifies them based on the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2`, `right` is equal to `j`.**
