Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w'. If the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w', then `top` is updated to 1, `bottom` is updated to 1, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. Additionally, `i` remains 1 which is less than or equal to `bottom` and is greater than or equal to `top`. If `top` is None, it confirms the presence of 'w' at `screen[1][j]` and establishes the boundaries accordingly; otherwise, the boundaries are adjusted based on the position of 'w' in the `screen`.***
