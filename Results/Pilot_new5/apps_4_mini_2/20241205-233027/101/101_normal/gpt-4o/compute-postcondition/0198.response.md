According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `j` which ranges from `left` to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the value of `left + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. 

Since `left` is less than or equal to `right`, after the current iteration where `j` is `left + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `left + 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` remains less than or equal to `right`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` will be updated to `left + 2`.

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 2`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.**
