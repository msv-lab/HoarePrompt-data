According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `left` and `right`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `left + 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase.

Given that `left` is less than or equal to `right`, if `j` is currently `left + 1`, then for the next iteration, `j` will be `left + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than or equal to `right`, which implies that `right` must be at least `left + 2`.

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `right` must be at least `left + 2`**
