The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `k + 1`, where `k < m - 1`, which means that `j` is at least 1 and less than `m`. The values of `left` and `right` are now equal to `j`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`), `top` is equal to `bottom` which is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`**.
