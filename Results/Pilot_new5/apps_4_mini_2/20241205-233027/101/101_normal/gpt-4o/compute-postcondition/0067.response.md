Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, and `i` is less than `top`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to be equal to `j`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to be equal to `j`. Otherwise, the values of `right`, `bottom`, and `left` remain unchanged.***
