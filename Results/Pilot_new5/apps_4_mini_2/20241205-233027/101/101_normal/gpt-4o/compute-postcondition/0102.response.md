The variables `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`, which means both will hold the same index value corresponding to the column containing 'w'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `right` and both are equal to `j`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `right` and both are equal to `j`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w'.**
