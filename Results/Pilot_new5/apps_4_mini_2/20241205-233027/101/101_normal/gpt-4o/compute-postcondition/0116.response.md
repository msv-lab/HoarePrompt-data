Postcondition: ***`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `right` and both are equal to `j`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w' if `top` is None. Otherwise, `top` is equal to 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than `bottom` and remains equal to 1 if it is less than `top`, the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `j` is greater than `right` if `j` is greater than `right`.***
