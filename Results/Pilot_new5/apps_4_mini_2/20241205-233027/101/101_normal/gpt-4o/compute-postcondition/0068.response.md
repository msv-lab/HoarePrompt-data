Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to the index `i`, where `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. Otherwise, `top` is equal to `i`, `i` is less than `top`, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`; and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to `j`, while remaining unchanged otherwise.***
