Postcondition: ***`top` is 1 or None, `bottom` is 1, `left` is set to `j + 1`, `right` is set to `j + 1`, `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 (and must be less than `m`). If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain as described.***
