According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000. The loop index `i` has not been provided, but we know that it must have been less than `n` for the loop to have executed. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` for the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < n`. 

To summarize:
- `i` must be adjusted to `i + 1`.
- The condition that `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` remains true.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is the current iteration index which must be less than `n` (specifically `i` is incremented by 1).**
