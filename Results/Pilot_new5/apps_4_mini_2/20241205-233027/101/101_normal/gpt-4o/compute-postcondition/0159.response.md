The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at `result[i][j]`. The initial state indicates that `result[i][j]` was previously equal to `'.'`, and this is the only variable that is directly affected by the code. The initial conditions regarding `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and the current values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `left`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `right`, the element at `result[i][j]` is now '+'**.
