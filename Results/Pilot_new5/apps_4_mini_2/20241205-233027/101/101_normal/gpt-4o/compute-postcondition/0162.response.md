According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `left` and `right`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` can take values between `left` and `right`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `left`, thus the next value of `j` will increase by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `left + 1`. Additionally, the condition for the loop to execute again requires that `left` is less than or equal to `right`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `left + 1`, and `left` must still be less than or equal to `right`.

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`**
