Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `right`, and `result[i][j]` has been updated to '+' for every '.' at positions where `i` is equal to either `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right` within the range from `left` to `right`, inclusive. If the loop does not execute, `j` will be equal to `left`, and `result[i][j]` will remain unchanged.**
