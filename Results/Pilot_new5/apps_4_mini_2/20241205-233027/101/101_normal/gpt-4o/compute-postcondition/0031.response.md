The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, `left`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `left` is updated to the value of `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`.
