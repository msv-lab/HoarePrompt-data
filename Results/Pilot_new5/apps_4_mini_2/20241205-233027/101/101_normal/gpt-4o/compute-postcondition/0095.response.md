Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `j` is `k + 2`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to `i` and `j`, respectively. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`; otherwise, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', no changes occur to any of the variables.***
