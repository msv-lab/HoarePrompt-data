The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is given as `k + 1`, where `k < m - 1`. Since `j` is not dependent on the values of `top`, `bottom`, or `left`, those variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of the variables will reflect that `right` is now equal to `j`, while all other variables retain their original constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`), `right` is `j`**.
