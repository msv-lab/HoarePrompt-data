The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that the initial state specifies that `i` is 0, both `top` and `bottom` will be set to 0 as well. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
