Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If 'w' is present in the screen, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will not be None; otherwise, if no 'w' is present, they remain None.**
