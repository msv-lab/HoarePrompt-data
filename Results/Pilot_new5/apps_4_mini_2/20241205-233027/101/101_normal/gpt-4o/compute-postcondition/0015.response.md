The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` is less than `left` (which is currently None), this condition does not affect the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `i` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `left` (which is now 0).**
