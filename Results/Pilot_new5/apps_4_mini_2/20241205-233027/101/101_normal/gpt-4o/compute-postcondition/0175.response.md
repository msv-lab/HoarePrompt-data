The value of `result[i][j]` is assigned the character `'+'`. The previous condition states that `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, and `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`. Since `result[i][j]` is being modified, the specific indices `i` and `j` will now hold a `'+'` instead of a period `'.'`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'**
