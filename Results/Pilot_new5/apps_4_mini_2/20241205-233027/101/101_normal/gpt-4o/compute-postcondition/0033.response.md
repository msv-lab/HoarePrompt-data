Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 1. If `top` is None, `left` is updated to 1 and `right` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `top` is not None, `left` remains unchanged, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is updated to the value of `j` and `right` is set equal to `j`.***
