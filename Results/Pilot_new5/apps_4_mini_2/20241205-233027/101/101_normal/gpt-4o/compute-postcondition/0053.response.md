The values of `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is less than `n`. Therefore, the value of `top` and `bottom` will now be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
