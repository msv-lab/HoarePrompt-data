Postcondition: ***`top` is 1 or None, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j + 1`, `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 (and must be less than `m`). If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` will be updated to `j`. If `j` is not less than `left`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain as described.***
