Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is at least `left + 2`, and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'; otherwise, there is no change to `result[i][j]`.***
