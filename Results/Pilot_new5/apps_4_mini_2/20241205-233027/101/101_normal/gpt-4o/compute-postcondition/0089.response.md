Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2` (where `k < m - 2), if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` is set to `i` and `bottom` is also set to `i`, while `left` and `right` remain unchanged. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
