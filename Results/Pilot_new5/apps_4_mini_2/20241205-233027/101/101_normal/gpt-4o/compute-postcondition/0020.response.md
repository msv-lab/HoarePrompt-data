Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', if `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to 0, and `i` and `j` remain 0 with the character at position `screen[i][j]` being 'w'. If `top` is not None, then `top` remains 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, and `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, with no changes if `j` is not greater than `right`.***
