Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', and `i` is less than `top`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and since `i < top`, this condition holds true.***
