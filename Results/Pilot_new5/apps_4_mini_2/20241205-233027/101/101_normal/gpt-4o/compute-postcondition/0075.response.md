The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. This does not change the value of `i` or any other variables, but it sets `bottom` to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`), if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`, and `bottom = i`.
