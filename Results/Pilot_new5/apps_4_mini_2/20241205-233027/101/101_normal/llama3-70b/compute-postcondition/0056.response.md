The code assigns the value '.' to the element at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `j` is also 1, so the specific cell being updated is `pixels[1][1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `i` is still 1 and `j` is still 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated condition of the `pixels` array.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` is '.'**
