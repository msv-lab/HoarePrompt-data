According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j`, and it will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must remain at least 2, as it is greater than 1.

Since `j` must be less than `m` for another iteration, the next states should ensure that `j` is now 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 for further iterations.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
