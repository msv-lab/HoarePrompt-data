The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element at the position `pixels[i][j]`. The initial conditions state that `i` and `j` do not equal any of `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and that `pixels[i][j]` is neither `'.'` nor `'w'`. Therefore, after execution, the state of `pixels[i][j]` changes to be `'.'`.

Since the only variable affected is `pixels[i][j]`, the output state will reflect that change while maintaining the other conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `pixels[i][j]` is now '.'**
