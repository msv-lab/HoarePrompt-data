The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the specific position being updated is `pixels[2][1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, but `j` is confirmed to be 1 based on the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and pixels[2][1] is '+'**.
