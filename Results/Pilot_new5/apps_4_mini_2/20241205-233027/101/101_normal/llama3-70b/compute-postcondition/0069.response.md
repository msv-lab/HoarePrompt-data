The code updates the value of `pixels[i][j]` to '+'. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0, the specific location in the `pixels` array is modified. The conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and the relationships to `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the status of other variables is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `pixels[2][0]` is '+'**
