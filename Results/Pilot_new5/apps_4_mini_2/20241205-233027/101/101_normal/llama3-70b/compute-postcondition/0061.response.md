The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
