According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop is set to iterate over a range of `m`, so it can execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means before the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1 (the next value after 0), and for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than 1; otherwise, the loop will not be able to run again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
