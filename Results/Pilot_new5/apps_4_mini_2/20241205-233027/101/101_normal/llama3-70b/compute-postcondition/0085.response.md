The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, or `j`. It simply causes the loop to skip the rest of its body for this iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
