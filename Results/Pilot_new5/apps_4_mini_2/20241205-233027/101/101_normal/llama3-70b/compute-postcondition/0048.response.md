The code `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, continuing with the next iteration without altering the values of any variables in this context. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and no additional state regarding these variables is modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the value of `i` is neither equal to `min_x` nor `max_x`, `j` is neither equal to `min_y` nor `max_y`, the value of `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'.**
