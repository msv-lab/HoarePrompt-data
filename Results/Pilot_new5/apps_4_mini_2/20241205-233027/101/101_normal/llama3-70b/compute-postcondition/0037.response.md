The code `continue` does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in. Since `continue` does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, or `j`, we note that the program will continue to the next iteration without making any changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
