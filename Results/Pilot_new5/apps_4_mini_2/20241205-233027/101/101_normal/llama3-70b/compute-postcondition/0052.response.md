Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then the element at `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and if it is 'w', then it remains 'w'. If it is not 'w', then `pixels[i][j]` has been changed to '.' and is not equal to 'w'.***
