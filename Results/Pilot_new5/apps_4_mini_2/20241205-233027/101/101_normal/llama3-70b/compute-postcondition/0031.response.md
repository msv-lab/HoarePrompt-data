The code `continue` is a statement that skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any of the variables as a result of this statement, the output state will reflect that no variables have been altered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
