The command `continue` causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of the loop. As such, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

The output state reflects that no variables were modified, but the execution flow has moved to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains as it was initially stated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The values of `i` and `j` are not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, or `max_y`. The value of `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.**
