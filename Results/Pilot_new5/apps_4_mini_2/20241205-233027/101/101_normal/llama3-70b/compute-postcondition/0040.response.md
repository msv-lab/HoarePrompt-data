Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If the condition involving `i` and `j` is met and `pixels[0][2]` is '.', then `pixels[0][2]` is set to '+'. If the condition is not met and `pixels[0][2]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `pixels[0][2]` remains '.' indicating that the condition was not satisfied.***
