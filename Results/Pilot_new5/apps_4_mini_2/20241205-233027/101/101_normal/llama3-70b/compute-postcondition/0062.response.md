The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element located at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `j` is currently 2, so the specific element being updated is `pixels[1][2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[1][2]` is set to '.'**
