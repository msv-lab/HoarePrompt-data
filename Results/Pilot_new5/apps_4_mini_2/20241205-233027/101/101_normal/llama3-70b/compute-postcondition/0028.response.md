Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', it remains unchanged; if it is anything else, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'.***
