Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2; `prev_start` is now set to `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is now set to `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` is now equal to `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is now equal to `segments[2][1]`, `i` is 2, and `len(segments)` is greater than 2.**
