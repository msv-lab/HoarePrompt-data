The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `n` must be greater than `start + 1` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G', the states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `start + 1`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G', and `i` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `start + 1`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G', `i` is increased by 1.**
