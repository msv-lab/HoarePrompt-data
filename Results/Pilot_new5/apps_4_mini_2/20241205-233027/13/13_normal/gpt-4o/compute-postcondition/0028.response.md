Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3 and `trophies` is a string of length `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` remains 3 and `segments` includes the tuples `(start, 2)` and `(start, i - 1)`, where `i` is the first index greater than or equal to 3 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` equals `n`. Otherwise, if `trophies[i]` is not 'G', then `i` is updated to 4, and `segments` still includes the tuple `(start, 2)`, with the character at index `i` in `trophies` being not 'G'.***
