Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3 and `trophies` is a string of length `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first character in `trophies` that is not 'G', and `segments` has been updated to include the tuple (start, i - 1). Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.***
