The value of `max_length` is assigned the maximum length of the segments of contiguous 'G's in `trophies`, calculated as `end - start + 1` for each tuple in `segments`. Since `segments` is not empty, there is at least one tuple (start, end) which will yield a specific maximum length. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all segments of contiguous 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length of segments of contiguous 'G's calculated as `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`**.
