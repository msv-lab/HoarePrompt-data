The variable `max_beauty` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `golden`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is an input string; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is an input string; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0.**
