The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`; `right` is incremented by 1; `curr_beauty` is 0; `s[0]` must not be 'G'; `left` is increased by 1.
