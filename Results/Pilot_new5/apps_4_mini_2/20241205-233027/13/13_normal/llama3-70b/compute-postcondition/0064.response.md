Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S'. If the current value of `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is set to 2 and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `beauty` remains 1, `j` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
