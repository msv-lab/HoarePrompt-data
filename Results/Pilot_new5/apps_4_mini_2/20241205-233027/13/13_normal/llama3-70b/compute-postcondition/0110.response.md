The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` (inclusive). Since `s` contains 'G' characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` and `j` points to an index containing 'G', the increment indicates that there is at least one more 'G' being counted in this sequence. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to -1 after the loop ends, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` (inclusive) + 1, and the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G'**.
