Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]` are 'G', `beauty` is equal to the count of 'G' characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]`, and the loop has executed as long as `s[j]` is 'G' until reaching a character that is not 'G' or going out of bounds.**
