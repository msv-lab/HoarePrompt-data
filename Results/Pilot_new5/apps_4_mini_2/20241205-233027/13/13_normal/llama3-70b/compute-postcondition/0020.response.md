The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so after the execution, `curr_beauty` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to the first index of 'G' in `s`, `right` is greater than `left`, `s[left]` is 'G', `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, and `left` is less than `right`.**
