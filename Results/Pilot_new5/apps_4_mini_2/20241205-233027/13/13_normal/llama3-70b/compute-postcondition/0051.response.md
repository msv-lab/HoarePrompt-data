Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` or equal to `right` if 'G' does not occur before `right`; `s[left]` must be 'G' if `left` is less than `right`; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or 1; `right` has been incremented by 1; if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is now 1.***
