Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and `j` is initialized to `i - 2`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
