Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, and `j` is at least `i + 3` and must be less than `n - 1`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
