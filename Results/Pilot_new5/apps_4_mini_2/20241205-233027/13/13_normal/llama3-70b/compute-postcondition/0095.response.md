The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, so after the operation, `beauty` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `j`, `max_beauty_one_swap`) are not affected by this increment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to `i - 1` and will decrement until it reaches 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is now 2, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to `i - 1` and will decrement until it reaches 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is now 2, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'**.
