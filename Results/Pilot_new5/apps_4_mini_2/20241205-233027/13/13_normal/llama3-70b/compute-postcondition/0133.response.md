According to the code, the loop iterates backward from `i - 1` to `0`. The loop can execute again if `j` can be decremented further. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented to `j - 1`, which would make `j` equal to `i - 2`. 

Also, `i` must still be at least `1` to ensure that `j` is not below `0` in the next iteration. Since `n` is in the range `2 <= n <= 100000`, it does not affect the loop execution directly but can be relevant to the overall program logic.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` is updated to `i - 2`.
- `s[j]` will be the character at the new position `j`, which is `i - 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'. If the character at `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to 2. If `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
