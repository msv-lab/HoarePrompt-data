Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, and `max_beauty` is 0. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is updated to 1, `left` is 0, and `right` is the current index where `s[right]` is 'G'. If `s[right]` is not 'G', then `left` is equal to the first index of 'G' in `s`, `right` is greater than `left`, and if `left` is less than `right`, `curr_beauty` is updated to 1 while `left` remains less than `right`.***
