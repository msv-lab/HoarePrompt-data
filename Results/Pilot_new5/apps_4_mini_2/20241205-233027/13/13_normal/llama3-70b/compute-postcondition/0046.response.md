According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`, as well as the character at the position `s[left]`. The loop can execute again if `left` is less than `right` and `s[left]` is not 'G'.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `left` is incremented by 1 and is less than `right`, which means `left < right` is satisfied.
- `s[left]` must not be 'G', which is also satisfied.

Since both conditions for the while loop are currently satisfied, the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any states. 

Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`; `right` is incremented by 1; `curr_beauty` is 0; `s[0]` must not be 'G'; `left` is incremented by 1 and is less than `right`; `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
