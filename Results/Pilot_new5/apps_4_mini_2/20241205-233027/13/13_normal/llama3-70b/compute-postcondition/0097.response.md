The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is 1, `j` will decrement until it reaches 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
