The code creates a list called `golden` that contains the indices of all occurrences of the character 'G' in the string `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged in this operation, but `golden` is initialized with the indices based on the string `s`. The values of `golden` depend on the contents of `s`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is an input string; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`.**
