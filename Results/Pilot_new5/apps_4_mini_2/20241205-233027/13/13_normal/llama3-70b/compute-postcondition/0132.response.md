Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'. If the character at `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to 2. If `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
