Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0 or 1, `right` has been incremented by 1, and `curr_beauty` is adjusted such that if `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1. If `s[right]` is not 'G', `left` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` or equal to `right` if 'G' does not occur before `right`, ensuring that `s[left]` is 'G' if `left` is less than `right`, and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is now 1.***
