The variable `beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged and valid according to the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is at least `i + 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and `beauty` is 1.
