According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`, as well as the condition that `s[left]` must not be 'G'. For the loop to execute again, it needs to satisfy `left < right` and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `left` was increased by 1, which means it is now equal to its previous value plus 1.
- `right` has been incremented by 1, so `right` is now greater than it was at the beginning of the last iteration.
- `s[0]` must not be 'G', which also affects the values of `s[left]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `left` must still be less than `right`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'. Since `left` has been increased by 1, `left` must be less than `right`, but we don't have the specific values to determine how much we can increment `left` without it reaching `right`.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
1. `left` must still be less than `right`.
2. `s[left]` must not be 'G' after increasing `left` by 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to infer based on the increment of `left` that `right` must be greater than `left` after the increment. Therefore, we can conclude that `left` must be less than or equal to `right - 1` to ensure that the condition `left < right` still holds.

Since `curr_beauty` is not needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute again and `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, these do not require any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`; `right` is incremented by 1; `curr_beauty` is 0; `s[0]` must not be 'G'; `left` must be less than `right`; `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
