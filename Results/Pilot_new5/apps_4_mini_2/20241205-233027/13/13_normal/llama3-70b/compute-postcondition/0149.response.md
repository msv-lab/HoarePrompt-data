The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `s`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.
