The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous state of the other variables is not affected, and all conditions related to `n`, `i`, `s[j]`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, we only update the value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `s[j]` must be 'G' or it will break out of the loop, `j` is `i - 1`, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
