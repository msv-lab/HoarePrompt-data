According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 2`, which implies that the maximum possible value for `j` is `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be `i + 2`.

Since `j` starts at `i + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, and since `i + 2` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `i + 2`.

Thus, the new states at the beginning of the next iteration will be:
- `j` would be `i + 2` in the next iteration,
- and `n` must remain unchanged, except it must still satisfy the condition of being greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`**.
