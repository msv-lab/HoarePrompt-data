The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 100000, and the conditions on `s[left]` (where `s[2]` is not 'G') and `right` (which is greater than 2) are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `left` is 3, `s[2]` must not be 'G', and `right` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `left` is 3, `s[2]` must not be 'G', and `right` must be greater than 2.**
