According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, which means that for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `i` is currently at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, after incrementing `i`, it will be at least 2 and less than `n - 1`. Hence, it will remain valid for the next iteration.

The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which will still satisfy the condition that `i` is less than `n - 1`. As such, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is at least `i + 2` and less than `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
