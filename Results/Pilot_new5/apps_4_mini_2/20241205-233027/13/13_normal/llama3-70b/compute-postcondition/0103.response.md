According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `j`, which is initialized to `i - 2`. The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1 as it goes through the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be at least `0`. Therefore, since `j` is currently `i - 2`, in the next iteration, `j` will become `i - 3`.

The conditions for the loop will be as follows:
- `j` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `i` must be at least `2`.
- `s[j]` is checked during the loop; if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1, otherwise, the program breaks.

Since `i` is already at least `2` and is less than `n - 1`, `n` does not need to be modified. The only state that changes is the value of `j`, which will be `i - 3` in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is `i - 3`**
