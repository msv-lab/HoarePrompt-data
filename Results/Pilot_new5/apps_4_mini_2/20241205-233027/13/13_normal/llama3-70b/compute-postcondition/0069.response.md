According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts from `i - 1` and decrements down to `0`. Since `i` is at least 1 at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute once more. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, which means the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `i - 1`. Since `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', we know that `s[j]` can still be 'G' for the loop to continue increasing the `beauty`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be `i - 1`, and `s[j]` must be checked again. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is not less than `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `s[j]` must be 'G' or it will break out of the loop, and `j` is `i - 1`**
