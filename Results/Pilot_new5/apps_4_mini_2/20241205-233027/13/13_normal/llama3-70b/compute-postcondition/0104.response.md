The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The constraints on `n`, `i`, and `s` are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is `i - 3`, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
