Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is -1, and `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`. If the last character of `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to `i + 2`. Otherwise, `beauty` remains `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the character at index `j` not being 'G'.***
