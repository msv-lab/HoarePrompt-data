The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]` are 'G', `beauty` is equal to the count of 'G' characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
