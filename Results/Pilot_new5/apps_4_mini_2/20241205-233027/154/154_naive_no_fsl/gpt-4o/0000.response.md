To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step and consider possible edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
Polycarp has `n` tasks, each consisting of `k` subtasks. He can earn points by completing these subtasks and gets additional points for completing entire tasks. He has `M` minutes to solve the subtasks, and each subtask has a specific time requirement given in the list `t`.

The task is to find the maximum points possible under the constraints.

### Program Logic
1. **Total Time Calculation**: The program calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks for a task using `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`.
2. **Complete Tasks Loop**: It loops through the number of complete tasks from `0` to `n`.
3. **Points Calculation**: For each complete task count, it calculates the time used and checks if it exceeds `M`.
4. **Remaining Time for Subtasks**: If there's remaining time, it calculates how many subtasks can be solved with that time.
5. **Points Update**: It updates the maximum points based on complete tasks and subtasks solved. 

### Potential Issues
1. **Incomplete Subtask Handling**: The logic for handling remaining time after completing tasks might not account for the potential combination of subtasks across different tasks effectively. It only checks how many of each subtask can be solved based on time remaining but does not account for distributing this time among the remaining incomplete tasks efficiently.
   
2. **Upper Limits**: Given that `M` can be as large as `2 * 10^9`, the loop might not handle scenarios where all subtasks are trivially solvable by many tasks effectively.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider a case where `M` is very small compared to the time required for the subtasks. Suppose `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `M = 1`, and `t = [2, 2]`. The program should return `0` points since no subtask can be completed, but the handling of remaining time should reflect that correctly.

### Example Case
- For the input:
  ```
  2 2 1
  2 2
  ```
  The expected output would be `0`, but since the loop does not handle such a case correctly, it may give an incorrect output due to the way remaining time and subtasks are calculated.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially those involving combinations of subtasks across tasks and small values of `M`. Thus, it does not always produce the correct output as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
