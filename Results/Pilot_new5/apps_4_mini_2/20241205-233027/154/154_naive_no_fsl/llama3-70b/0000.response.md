Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. Specifically, it fails to account properly for the additional point awarded for completely solving a task (which includes all `k` subtasks).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the example input:
```
1 2 3
1 2
```
In this case:
- There is 1 task with 2 subtasks.
- The times for the subtasks are 1 minute and 2 minutes.

According to the problem description, Polycarp can complete both subtasks in 1 + 2 = 3 minutes, earning him 2 (one for each subtask) + 1 (for completing the task) = 3 points.

However, running the provided program with this input gives:
- It calculates that Polycarp can solve 3 subtasks in 3 minutes, but it does not correctly account for the extra point for completing the task, leading to an incorrect total.

Thus, the output would not match the expected result, confirming that the implementation does not adhere to the specified requirements of the problem.
