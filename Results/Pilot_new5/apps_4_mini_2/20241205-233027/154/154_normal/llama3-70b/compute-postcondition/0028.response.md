Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[k][2 - t[k - 1]] + 1`.***
