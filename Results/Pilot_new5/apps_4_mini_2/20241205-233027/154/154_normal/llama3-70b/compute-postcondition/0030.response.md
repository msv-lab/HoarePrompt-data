The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The indices `i` and `j` are `k + 1` and `3`, respectively. Therefore, `dp[k + 1][3]` will be assigned the value of `dp[k + 1][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3, `dp[k + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[k + 1][2]`.**
