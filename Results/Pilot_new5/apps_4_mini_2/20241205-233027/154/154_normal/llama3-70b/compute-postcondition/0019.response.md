According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to `k + 1`. This means the loop executes for `i` values starting from 1 up to and including `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been `k` during the last execution. To execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become `k + 1`.

Furthermore, the loop will execute again as long as `M` is greater than 0, implying that `dp[i][j]` can be calculated. If `M` were 0, the loop would not have executed at all. Since `M` is at least 1, it can be assumed that the loop can execute once more.

Given that the loop ends with `i` being `k`, the next iteration will require `i` to be `k + 1`, and `M` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` still contains the maximum number of items that can be selected, calculated based on the loop's conditions.**
