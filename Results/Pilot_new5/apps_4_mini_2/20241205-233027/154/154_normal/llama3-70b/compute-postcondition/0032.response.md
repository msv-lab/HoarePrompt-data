Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][3]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[k][3 - t[k - 1]] + 1.***
