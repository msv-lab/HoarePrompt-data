Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, and `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected with the first `i` items and capacity `j`, where `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the conditions of the loop. If `M` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][j]` remains 0 for all `j`.**
