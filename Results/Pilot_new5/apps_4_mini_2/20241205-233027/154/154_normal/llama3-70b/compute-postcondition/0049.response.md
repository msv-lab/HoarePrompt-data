Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, and `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected with the first `k` items and capacity `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`. If `M` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` remains 0 for all `i` and `j`.**
