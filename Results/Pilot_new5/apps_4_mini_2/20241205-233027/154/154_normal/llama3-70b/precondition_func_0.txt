n is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer representing the total minutes available (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of integers of length k where each element t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask of any task.
