To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the specified problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. Polycarp has `n` tasks, each containing `k` subtasks.
2. Each subtask `j` takes `t[j]` minutes to solve.
3. Solving a subtask earns 1 point, and completing all `k` subtasks in a task earns an extra point (total points for a completed task = `k + 1`).
4. The goal is to maximize the points earned within `M` minutes.

### Program Analysis
#### Input Parsing
- The program reads the number of tasks (`n`), the number of subtasks (`k`), and the total available minutes (`M`).
- It also reads the list of times for each subtask (`t`).

#### Dynamic Programming Table Initialization
- The program initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using the first `i` subtasks with `j` minutes available.

#### Filling the DP Table
- The inner loops iterate over each subtask and each possible time limit from `1` to `M`.
- The DP table is filled based on whether the current time allows solving the `i-th` subtask.
- The logic checks if the current time `j` is sufficient to include the current subtask and updates the maximum solved subtasks accordingly.

#### Points Calculation
- The program calculates the total points by summing the maximum subtasks that can be solved for the available `M` minutes and checking how many tasks can be completely solved (by comparing the maximum solved subtasks with the number of subtasks).

### Correctness Verification
1. **Subtask Points Calculation**: The program correctly computes the maximum number of subtasks solved using a dynamic programming approach, which is appropriate for this type of problem.

2. **Completion Points Calculation**: The program includes logic to check how many tasks can be fully completed based on the filled DP table. This takes into account the bonus point for completing a task.

3. **Constraints Handling**: The program correctly handles constraints on `n`, `k`, and `M`, ensuring no overflows or invalid accesses occur.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description requirements and correctly implements the logic to maximize the points based on the time and subtasks available.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
