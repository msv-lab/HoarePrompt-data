The function accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `M` and a list `t`, calculates the maximum points achievable by completing full tasks and utilizing leftover time for solving subtasks, and returns that maximum points. It does not handle cases where `M` is zero, which would imply no possible completion of tasks or subtasks.
