Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer representing the total available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of k integers where each integer t[j] represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000).**
