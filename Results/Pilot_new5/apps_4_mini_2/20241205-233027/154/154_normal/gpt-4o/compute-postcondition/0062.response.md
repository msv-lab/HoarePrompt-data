To determine the necessary state adjustments for the `for` loop to execute, we first analyze the provided state before the loop and the loop statement itself.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`
- `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`
- `subtasks_solved` is 0
- `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`
- `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`
- `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`

The loop statement is:
```
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The execution of the loop depends primarily on the iterable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a collection (like a list or a range) that contains elements. This means that `t` should not be empty.

Steps to consider:
1. Since `n` is given to be at least 1, it's guaranteed there is at least one complete task.
2. The loop will iterate over `t`. If `t` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. We need to ensure that `subtask_time` can be initialized to the first element of `t`, thus:
   - If `t` is a list, it should have at least one element.

Based on the above analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `t` must be a non-empty collection (e.g., a list or a range).
- `subtask_time` should be set to the first element of `t` upon the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` must be a non-empty collection, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`**
