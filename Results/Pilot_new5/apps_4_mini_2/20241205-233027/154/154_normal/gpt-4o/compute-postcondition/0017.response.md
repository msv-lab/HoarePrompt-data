The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is recalculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The initial state provides that `remaining_time` is equal to `M` and that `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is now updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `M // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task**.
