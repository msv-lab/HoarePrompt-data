The variable `time_used` is assigned the value equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. Given that `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, the calculation for `time_used` becomes `n * total_time_per_task`. The initial values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, and `max_points` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `time_used`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k, `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved)**.
