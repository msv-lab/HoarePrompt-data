The variable `max_points` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `total_time_per_task` remain unchanged as this line does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_points` while retaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer representing the total available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` represents the time in minutes required to solve the `j-th` subtask, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0**.
