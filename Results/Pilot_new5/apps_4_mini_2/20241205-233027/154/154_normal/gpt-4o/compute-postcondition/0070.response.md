The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, this means that `subtasks_solved` will now hold its previous value plus the number of maximum subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time divided by the time taken for each subtask. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated accordingly, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
