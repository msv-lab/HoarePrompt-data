The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k, `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
