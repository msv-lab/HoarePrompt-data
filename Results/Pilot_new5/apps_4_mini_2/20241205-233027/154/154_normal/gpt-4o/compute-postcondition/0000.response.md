The `total_time_per_task` is assigned the value of `sum(t)`, which calculates the total time required to solve all subtasks for a single task. The variable `t` contains `k` integers, where each integer represents the time in minutes required for a specific subtask. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer representing the total available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` represents the time in minutes required to solve the `j-th` subtask, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)` (the total time required for all subtasks).**
