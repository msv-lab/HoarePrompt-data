Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45) and `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time % subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` which is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points + subtasks_solved`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, the values remain unchanged.***
