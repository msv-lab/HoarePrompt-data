The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Then `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - 0`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `0 + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `t` is a non-empty iterable, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
