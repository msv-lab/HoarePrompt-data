The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Given that `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, the value of `points` becomes `n * (k + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`.**
