Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` is a non-empty iterable, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`. The current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
