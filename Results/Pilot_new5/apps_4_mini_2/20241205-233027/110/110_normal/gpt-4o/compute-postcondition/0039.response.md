The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. All parameters are positive integers, where `n` and `m` represent the dimensions of the pond, `r` represents the size of the scoop, and `k` represents the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond with the constraint that \( k \leq \min(n \cdot m, 10^5) \). After executing the function body, it calculates the average coverage per position, which is obtained by dividing the total coverage (the sum of the coverage values of the k popped tuples) by the total number of positions, calculated as \( (n - r + 1) \cdot (m - r + 1) \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the dimensions of the pond, the size of the scoop, and the number of fishes, and return the average coverage per position based on the calculated coverage values and available positions in the pond.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (dimensions of the pond), r (size of the scoop), and k (number of distinct fishes), and returns the average coverage per position.**
