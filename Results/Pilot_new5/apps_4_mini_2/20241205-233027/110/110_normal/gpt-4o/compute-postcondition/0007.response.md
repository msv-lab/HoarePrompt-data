The operation `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` will push a new tuple into the `heap`. The first element of the tuple is `-coverage(x, y)`, where `x` is currently 0 and `y` is 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. 

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, we can represent the first element of the tuple as `-coverage(0, 2)`. The second and third elements of the tuple are simply `0` and `2`, respectively. 

Therefore, the tuple being pushed to the `heap` is `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`. The state of the `heap` will have this new tuple added to the existing entries.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5); heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)` and `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)` and possibly other entries; `x` is 0; `y` is 2**
