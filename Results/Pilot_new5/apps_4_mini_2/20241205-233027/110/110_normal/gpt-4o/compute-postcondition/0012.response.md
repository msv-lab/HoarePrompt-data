According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` and the value of `m`. The loop will iterate as long as `y` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `y` will be incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, since the loop will continue while `y` is less than `m`.

State: **`heap` contains `m + 1` tuples, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and a new tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` has been added to `heap`.**
