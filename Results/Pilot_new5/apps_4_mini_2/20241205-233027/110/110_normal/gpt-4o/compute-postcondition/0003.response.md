In the given code snippet, the function `heapq.heappush` is used to push a tuple onto the `heap` list. The tuple consists of three elements: the negation of the result of the function `coverage(x, y)`, and the current values of `x` and `y`.

1. The initial values of `x` and `y` are both 0.
2. The coverage function is called with these values, so `coverage(0, 0)` will return some value (let's denote it as `c`).
3. The negation of that value, `-c`, will be the first element of the tuple being pushed onto the heap.
4. The values of `x` and `y`, which are both 0, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state incorporates the heap's new state after the push operation, which contains the tuple formed as described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5); heap` contains the tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0); `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**
