The value of `x` is 1, and the value of `y` is 0. The function `coverage(x, y)` is called, which will yield a specific coverage value based on `x` and `y`. The first element being pushed into the heap is `-coverage(1, 0)`, the second element is `1`, and the third element is `0`. The state of `heap` is updated to include this new tuple. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, while `heap` expands to contain `m + 1` tuples.

Output State: **`heap` contains `m + 1` tuples, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and a new tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` has been added to `heap`.**
