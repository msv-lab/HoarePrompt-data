The function accepts four positive integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `r` (size of the scoop), and `k` (number of distinct fishes). It calculates the total coverage by summing the coverage values of the `k` most covered positions in a grid defined by `n` and `m`, and then returns the average coverage per position based on the total coverage divided by the total number of valid positions for the scoop, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If `k` exceeds the total positions in the grid, it could lead to an error since the number of fishes should not exceed `n * m`. The function does not explicitly handle this edge case.
