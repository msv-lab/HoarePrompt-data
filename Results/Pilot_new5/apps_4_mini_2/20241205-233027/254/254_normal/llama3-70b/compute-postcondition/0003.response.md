The operation `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `b` is assigned the previous value of `a`, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. 

Here, since `b` must be greater than 0, we know that the modulo operation `a % b` will yield a value that is always less than `b` and non-negative. The previous value of `a` is used in the calculation for the new value of `a`, while `b` takes over the old value of `a`.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `a` now holds the value of `a % b` (where `b` is the previous value of `a`)
- `b` now holds the previous value of `a`

The other variable `c` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` is now `a % b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer**
