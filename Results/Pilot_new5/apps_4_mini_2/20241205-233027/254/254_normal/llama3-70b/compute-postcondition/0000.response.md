According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `b` is an integer, and since `b` can take any integer value, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute for the first time. The states for `a` and `c` do not need to be adjusted as they do not influence the execution of this specific loop.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer**
