The function `func` has no parameters. It operates on three integers `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3`, which are constrained such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3. However, since these parameters are not passed to the function, their values must be predefined or set within the function. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without explicit output details, we cannot describe the exact functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with predefined integer values `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` constrained between 1 and 1500, but the output behavior is not specified.**
