The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether Mishka can switch on three garlands in such a way that there is at least one garland lit during every second after the latest garland is turned on. 

The approach taken by the program is to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). The program then checks if this GCD is equal to 1. If the GCD is 1, it indicates that there are no common factors among the intervals, which means it is possible to find switching moments \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) such that the garlands will cover all seconds after the maximum of those moments. On the other hand, if the GCD is greater than 1, it means that all three intervals share a common factor, which implies that there will be some seconds when none of the garlands are lit.

However, the logic presented in the problem description does not require the GCD to be checked in such a way to conclude that the garlands can be turned on to ensure at least one is lit every second. The problem states that for every second after the maximum of the three starting seconds, at least one garland must be lit. Checking GCD only provides information about the common factors of the intervals but does not directly correlate with the ability to light the garlands adequately.

**Counterexample**: 
For \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
- The GCD is 1 since \( \gcd(4, 2, 3) = 1 \) and the program would output "YES", implying the garlands can be lit continuously.
- However, if we look at the lighting intervals: 
    - If \( x_1 = 0 \) for the first garland (lit at 0, 4, 8, ...),
    - If \( x_2 = 0 \) for the second (lit at 0, 2, 4, 6, ...),
    - If \( x_3 = 0 \) for the third (lit at 0, 3, 6, 9, ...),
  After the third moment, there will be a moment at second 1 where no garland is lit (0, 1, 2, ...). Thus, it is possible that there are moments that don't have any garland lit.

Therefore, the program does not correctly follow the problem description, and there exist cases where the output is misleading.

Correctness: **False**
