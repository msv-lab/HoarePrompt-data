The variable `script` is assigned an empty list. The initial states of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular` are not affected by this assignment, as it only alters the state of `script`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list containing the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0; `script` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list containing the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0; `script` is an empty list.**
