The `files` list is being sorted based on the integer values of the second element of each tuple in descending order. The list contains `n` tuples, each consisting of a string `name` and an integer `type_`. The order of the tuples in `files` will change based on the integer values, but the specific tuples are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact new order. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple.**
