The code initializes an empty list named `files`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of `n` and the new state of `files`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list.**
