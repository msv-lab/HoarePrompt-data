`script` is updated to include a new string formed by formatting the values of `file` and `i`. The variable `file` is the third element in the `examples` list, and `i` is 3. Because `script` is appending a new string, the previous content of `script` remains intact and the new string is added to it. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple, `examples` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3, and `script` now includes the string `move {file} 3` as well as any previous contents.**
