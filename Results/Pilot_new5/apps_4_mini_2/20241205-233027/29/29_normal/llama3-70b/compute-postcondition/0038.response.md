The function `func` does not take any parameters directly; however, it processes `n` lines of input where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Each line consists of a distinct string `name_i`, which contains digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6, and a `type_i`, which can either be '0' (for regular tests) or '1' (for example tests). 

The function's output behavior is not specified, but it is implied that based on the input lines, it will produce some result related to the types of tests. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a series of test cases based on the specified input format and constraints, but the exact return value is not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n followed by n lines of input, each containing a distinct name (a string of digits and small English letters, length 1 to 6) and a type ('0' for regular tests or '1' for example tests). The exact output of the function is not specified.**
