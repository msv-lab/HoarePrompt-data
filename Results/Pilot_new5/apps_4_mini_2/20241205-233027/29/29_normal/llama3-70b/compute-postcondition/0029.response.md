Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, and `script` now includes strings `move {file} {j}` for each `j` from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + n`.**
