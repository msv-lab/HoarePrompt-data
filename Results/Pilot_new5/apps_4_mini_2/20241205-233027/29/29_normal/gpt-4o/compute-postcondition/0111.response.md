The code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string includes the value of `temp_counter` and the element from `regulars` at index `i`. The initial conditions state that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and that `n` is a positive integer. The value of `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, which means that `temp_counter` is unique in that sense.

Since the operation does not modify `temp_counter`, `n`, or `files_set`, the only change in state is the addition of a new string to the `moves` list.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` now includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'**
