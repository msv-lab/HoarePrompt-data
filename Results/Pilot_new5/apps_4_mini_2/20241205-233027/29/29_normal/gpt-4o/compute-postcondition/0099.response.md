Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, `moves` now includes the instruction `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`, `regulars[i]` has been set to `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1.***
