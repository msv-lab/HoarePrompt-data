`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` will be between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`. The `examples[i]` still holds the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`, and `i` remains unchanged as the loop did not execute.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`; `examples[i]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`; `i` is still `i + 1`.**
