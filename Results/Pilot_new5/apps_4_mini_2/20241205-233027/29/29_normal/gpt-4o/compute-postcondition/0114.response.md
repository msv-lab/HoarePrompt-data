Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.***
