In the given state, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The conditions specify that `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than `2 * n`, meaning the increment will still keep `temp_counter` within its defined range. The value of `n` is a positive integer.

The updated value of `temp_counter` will be `temp_counter + 1`, but the exact value is not specified. However, it remains valid as long as it is less than `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than `2 * n`.**
