The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was initially adjusted to `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and must have at least 1 element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.**
