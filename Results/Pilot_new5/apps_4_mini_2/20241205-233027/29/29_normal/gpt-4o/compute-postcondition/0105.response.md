The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, it will be one greater than its previous value, but still must adhere to this condition. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, which must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must remain in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1` which is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
