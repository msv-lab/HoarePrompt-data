The variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was previously greater than `2 * n`, it will now be greater than `2 * n + 1`. Other variables retain their previous values, including the conditions regarding `files_set`, `examples`, `regulars`, `moves`, and `i`. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` does not contain the string representation of `temp_counter`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` now contains at least one element where `regulars[0]` is the string representation of `temp_counter`, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made including the new instruction `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`, `i` is 0**
