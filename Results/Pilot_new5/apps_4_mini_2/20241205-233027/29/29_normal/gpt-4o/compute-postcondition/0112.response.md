`regulars[i]` is assigned the value `str(temp_counter)`. The variable `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `n` is a positive integer, so `str(temp_counter)` will be a string representation of a value greater than `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` now includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` now includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`.**
