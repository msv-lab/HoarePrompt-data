`name` and `type_` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the string representation of `file`. `file` is the first tuple in the `files` list, and since tuples contain multiple elements, the split operation implies that `file` is a string. Therefore, the values of `name` and `type_` directly depend on the contents of that string. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of n tuples that must contain at least 1 tuple, `file` is the first tuple in the files list, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`.**
