Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and the length of `examples` remains unchanged. If `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, then `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`, and `examples[i]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`.***
