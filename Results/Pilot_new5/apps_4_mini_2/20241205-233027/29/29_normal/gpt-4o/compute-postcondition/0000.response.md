The variable `examples` is assigned an empty list, meaning it is now initialized to hold values. The states of the other variables, `n` and `files`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `files` is a list of n tuples containing distinct filenames and their corresponding types, and `examples` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains a string (filename) and an integer (type) which is either 0 (regular test) or 1 (example test), and `examples` is an empty list.**
