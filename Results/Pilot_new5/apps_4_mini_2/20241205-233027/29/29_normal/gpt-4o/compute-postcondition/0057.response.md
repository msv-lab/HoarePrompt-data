`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` can still satisfy this condition if it was previously within the allowed range. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` is now increased by 1 but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.**
