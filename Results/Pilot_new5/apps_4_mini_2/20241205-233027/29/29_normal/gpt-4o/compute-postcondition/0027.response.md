The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n`, it will still be less than `2 * n` after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is increased by 1 and is still less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` and is now `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
