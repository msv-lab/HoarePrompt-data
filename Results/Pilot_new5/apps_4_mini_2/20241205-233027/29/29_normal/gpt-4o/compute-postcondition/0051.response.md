The expression `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')` adds a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string is constructed using the current value of `examples[i]` and the value `i + 1`. The precondition states that `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` and that `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)` prior to this code segment. 

Since `examples[i]` was updated to `str(temp_counter)`, it now holds the string representation of `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + k + 1`, meaning `examples[i]` will contain a string value that is at least `str(2 * n + 2)` and at most `str(2 * n + k + 1)`.

The variable `moves` will have a new entry added, which will be of the format `move {str(temp_counter)} {i + 1}`.

The other variables (`n`, `temp_counter`, and `examples[i]`) retain their previous states after the execution of this code, apart from the fact that `examples[i]` has been updated as mentioned.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + k + 1`; `examples[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`; `moves` now contains an additional entry: `move {str(temp_counter)} {i + 1}`.**
