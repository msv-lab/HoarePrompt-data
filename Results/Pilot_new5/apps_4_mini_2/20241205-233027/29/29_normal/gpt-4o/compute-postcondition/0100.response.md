The code appends a new instruction to the `moves` list. The instruction is formatted as `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, where `regulars[i]` is currently set to `str(temp_counter)`, and `target` is a specific value. The previous state indicates that `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, which remains valid even after the operation. The value of `temp_counter` and any other variables remain unchanged, except for the fact that `moves` now includes an additional instruction.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` now includes `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {target}'`, and `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**.
