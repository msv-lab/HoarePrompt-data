`temp_counter` is assigned the value `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` will also be a positive integer greater than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is a positive integer equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is a positive integer equal to `n + 1`.**
