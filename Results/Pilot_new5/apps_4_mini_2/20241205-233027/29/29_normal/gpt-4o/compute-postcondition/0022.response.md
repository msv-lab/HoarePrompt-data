According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples` list. The `len(examples)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that at least one file in `files` has the type '1', which would populate the `examples` list.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it will iterate through the indices of the `examples` list. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `examples` contains at least 1 filename and that `i` starts from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is a positive integer equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
