The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained by the condition that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and `mod` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the product of integers from 2 to `n`, calculated modulo `mod`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a positive integer `mod`, and return the product of integers from 2 to `n` modulo `mod`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, an integer between 2 and 10^6, and `mod`, a positive integer, and returns the product of integers from 2 to `n` modulo `mod`.**
