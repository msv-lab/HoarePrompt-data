The variable `result` is assigned the value of `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer, and `result` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer, `result` is 1**
