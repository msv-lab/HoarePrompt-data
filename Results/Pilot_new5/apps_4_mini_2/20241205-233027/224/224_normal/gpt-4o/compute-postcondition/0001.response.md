According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, which it is according to the provided state (`2 <= n <= 10^6`). The variable `i` will start from 2, which is within the defined range. The variable `result` is 1, which does not affect whether the loop will execute but will be involved in the loop's calculations.

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be initialized to 2 (the starting point of the loop).
- `n` is already in the required range.

Thus, the modified state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
