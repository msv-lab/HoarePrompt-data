According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates starting from `i = 1` to `i = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we check the conditions:
- For the loop to run again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
- Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute another iteration, as the next value of `i` would be 3.

Thus, we can adjust the state as follows:
- `i` would be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
- `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run.

State: **`j` is -1, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`.**
