In the context provided, the for loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The number of iterations is governed by the variable `f_max_n`, which indicates how many times the loop has executed.

Given the following facts:
- If the loop has executed `f_max_n` times, the final value of `j` is 0.
- The loop will execute again if `f_max_n` is less than `n`, since `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

### Analyzing the state:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `j` is 0 (after the last iteration).
   - The values in `dp` have been updated based on the preceding iterations.
   - `i` is currently 1 (indicating the starting point for the next iteration).
   - `f_max_n` indicates how many times the loop has executed.
   
2. **Conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - Since the loop is set to run for `i` in `range(1, n + 1)`, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Thus, for another iteration to happen, `i` should increment to 2 (i.e., `i` becomes 2 after this iteration).

3. **Determining the new state**:
   - After one more iteration, `i` should be 2, so that it now points to the second element in the sequence from 1 to `n`.
   - `f_max_n` should now be at least 2 for the earlier conditions to hold true (which implies `n` must be at least 2).

### Final Adjusted State:
Therefore, we can summarize the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
