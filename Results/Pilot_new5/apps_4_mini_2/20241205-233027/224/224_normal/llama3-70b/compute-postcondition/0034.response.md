The value of `dp[j]` is updated with `dp[j] %= MOD`. Given that `j` is currently 0, this means `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `f_max_n`, `n`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and the invalid index access caused by `dp[-1]`) are not affected by this specific operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`, and an invalid index access occurs due to `dp[-1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`, and an invalid index access occurs due to `dp[-1]`.**
