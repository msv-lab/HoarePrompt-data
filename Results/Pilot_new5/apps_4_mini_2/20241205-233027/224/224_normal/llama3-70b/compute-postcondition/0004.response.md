According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute as long as `f_max_n` is at least 1 since it counts down to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer, it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.

The value of `j` will start at `f_max_n` and decrement with each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` is already set to 1, which does not affect the execution of the loop either.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `f_max_n` is at least 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
