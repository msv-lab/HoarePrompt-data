According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is greater than 0. The current state at the end of the last iteration shows that `j` is equal to `f_max_n`. Since `j` is iterating downwards from `f_max_n` to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, making it `f_max_n - 1`. 

Furthermore, for the loop to continue executing, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is already satisfied as per the provided state. 

Thus, the updated state will reflect that `j` is now `f_max_n - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**
