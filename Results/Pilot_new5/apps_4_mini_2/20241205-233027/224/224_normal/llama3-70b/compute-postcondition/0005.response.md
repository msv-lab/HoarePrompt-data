The code updates the `dp` array at index `j` by adding the value from `dp[j - 1]`. The variable `j` is set to `f_max_n`, which is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `dp[j]` will now be updated based on the previous value of `dp[j - 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
