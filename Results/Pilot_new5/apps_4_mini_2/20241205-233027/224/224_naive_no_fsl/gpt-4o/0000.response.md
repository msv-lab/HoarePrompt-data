To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented and how it relates to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The function `f(p)` is defined for a permutation `p` where:
   - \( g_i \) is the GCD of the first `i` elements of the permutation.
   - \( f(p) \) counts the distinct values among \( g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n \).
   
2. \( f_{max}(n) \) is the maximum value of \( f(p) \) among all permutations of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

3. The task is to count the permutations where \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

### Observations:
- The program hardcodes the result for \( n = 2 \) to be `1`, which is correct since the only permutation is `[1, 2]` and \( f(p) = 1 \).
  
- For \( n > 2 \), it calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, which computes the factorial of \( n - 1 \).

### Correctness Analysis:
- Let's analyze if the permutations counted by `func_1(n - 1)` correctly correspond to the permutations that yield \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

- The actual maximum distinct GCD values for permutations of \( n \) is related to how many distinct prime factors the numbers up to \( n \) can contribute. The maximum distinct values among GCDs will not simply follow the number of permutations or the factorial of \( n - 1 \).

#### Counter-Example:
For \( n = 3 \):
- Expected maximum distinct GCD values \( f_{max}(3) = 2 \) (from valid permutations like [2,1,3], [3,1,2], etc.).
- The function `func_1(n - 1)` calculates \( 2! = 2 \), but there are actually 4 permutations that yield \( f(p) = 2 \), not just \( 2 \) as returned by the factorial.

Thus, the program fails to consider the complete set of permutations that yield the correct count \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and identified counter-example, the program does not correctly compute the number of permutations that satisfy the condition for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
