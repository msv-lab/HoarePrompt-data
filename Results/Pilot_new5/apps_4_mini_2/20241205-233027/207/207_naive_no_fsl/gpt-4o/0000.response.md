To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_2`, which is intended to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` given the jumping rules of the frog.

### Understanding the Problem
1. **Jumping Rules**: The frog can jump to `k + a` or `k - b` starting from position `0`, and it must stay within the interval `[0, x]`.
2. **Function f(x)**: This function should return the number of distinct positions the frog can reach within the range `[0, x]`.
3. **Sum Requirement**: We need to find the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **GCD Reduction**: The first step involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `g` is not `1`, the problem is reduced by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. 
2. **Handling Small m**: If `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`, the program computes a simple sum of integers from `0` to `m`.
3. **General Case**: For larger `m`, it calculates the sum of reachable positions in two parts: positions reachable below `k` and positions reachable between `k` and `m`.

### Potential Issues
- **Distinct Reachable Positions**: The program relies on the assumption that the formula correctly accounts for all distinct positions the frog can reach. 
- **Boundary Cases**: If `a` is much larger than `m`, and `b` is small (or vice versa), certain positions might not be reached correctly. The current implementation does not seem to explicitly handle all edge cases regarding reachable integers.
- **Negative Jumps**: The logic for `k - b` does not handle cases properly if `b` is larger than `m`, which could result in inaccessible positions.

### Example Test Case
Consider the input:
```
m = 5, a = 10, b = 3
```
Expected reachable integers with `f(0)` to `f(5)` would yield different results, as the frog can jump far beyond `5` but not sufficiently backward to cover gaps created by `b`. The reachable values might not be handled with precision.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the jumps and the boundaries of `m`, there are cases where the program will produce incorrect results based on the problem description. Specifically, the handling of jumps when `b` exceeds `m` or when `gcd(a, b) > 1` could lead to incorrect sums.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
