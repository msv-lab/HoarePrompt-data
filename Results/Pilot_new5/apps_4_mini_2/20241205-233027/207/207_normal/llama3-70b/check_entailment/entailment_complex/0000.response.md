The provided program attempts to solve the problem of counting the distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given its jump capabilities defined by two integers, `a` and `b`. However, the implementation has several flaws that prevent it from achieving the desired result as specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization and State Definitions**:
   - The program initializes a list `dp` to store the number of ways to reach each position from `0` to `m`. This is not aligned with the problem's definition of `f(x)`, which is meant to count distinct integers reachable, not the number of ways to reach them.

2. **Jump Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. The way the dp array is updated does not correctly compute the reachable distinct integers based on the frogâ€™s jumping behavior. Specifically:
     - It adds to `dp[i + a]` based on `dp[i]`, which is a way to count paths but does not reflect the reachability of distinct integers.
     - The updating of `dp[i]` when `i - b` is valid is also incorrect, as it again counts ways rather than determining if `i` is reachable.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program sums up all values in `dp`, which would not yield the total number of distinct integers the frog can reach because `dp[i]` is not holding the correct values corresponding to the problem's requirements. The output printed is thus misleading and not representative of `f(i)`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement the logic required to count distinct integers reachable by the frog, as mandated by the problem description. The misinterpretation of counting ways instead of distinct integers leads to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
