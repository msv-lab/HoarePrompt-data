According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `m`. The variable `i` begins at 0 for the first iteration and can increase by 1 for each subsequent iteration until it reaches `m`. In the previous iteration, `i` must have been `m` for the loop to finish without additional iterations.

Since the loop is structured to run for `i` in the range of `m + 1`, the next value for `i` after `m` will be `m + 1`. Given that `m` can be as high as \(10^9\), we can conclude that after the last iteration where `i` is equal to `m`, the next loop iteration will not occur because the value of `i` will exceed the range specified by `m + 1`.

Thus, since the last value for `i` was `m`, and the loop is designed to run while `i` is less than or equal to `m`, we can summarize the next state.

State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers with 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, and 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `i` is `m + 1`**
