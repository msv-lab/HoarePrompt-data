Postcondition: ***`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers with 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, and 1 <= `b` <= 10^5. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[a]` is increased by 1, while all other elements remain 0. If `i + a` is greater than `m`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged with `dp[0]` as 1 and all other elements as 0. Additionally, the current value of `i` is such that `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0.***
