The value of `dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `dp` is initialized as a list of length `m + 1` with all elements set to `0`, after this assignment, `dp[0]` will be `1`, while all other indices in `dp` will remain `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
