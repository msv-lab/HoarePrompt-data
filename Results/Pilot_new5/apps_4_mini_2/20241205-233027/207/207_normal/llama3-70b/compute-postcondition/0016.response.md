In the initial state, we have `m`, `a`, and `b` as positive integers with `1 <= m <= 10^9`, `1 <= a <= 10^5`, and `1 <= b <= 10^5`. The variable `i` is defined as `m + 1`. 

The code snippet `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the value at the index `i + a` of the list `dp` by adding the value at the index `i`. We assume that `dp` is a list initialized with enough size to accommodate the indices being accessed.

After executing the code:
- The value at index `i + a` of the `dp` array is increased by the current value at index `i`.
- The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `dp[i + a]` has been modified.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the `dp` array while maintaining the original conditions for `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers with 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, and 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `i` is `m + 1`; `dp[i + a]` has been updated to be `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.**
