The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and computes their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues to run until `y` becomes 0, at which point it returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. It is important to note that if `y` starts as 0, the function would return `x` immediately without performing any calculations, which is a potential edge case.
