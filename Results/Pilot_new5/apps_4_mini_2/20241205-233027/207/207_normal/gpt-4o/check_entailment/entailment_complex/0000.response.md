Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

1. The function `func_2` relies on the GCD of `a` and `b` to determine whether it needs to perform a recursive call with scaled down values. While this may seem efficient, it doesn't guarantee the correctness of the results for every input, especially when considering the specific constraints of the frog's jumping capabilities.

2. The key logic of the problem is that the frog can jump to positions `k + a` and `k - b` from position `k`, all while staying within the bounds of `[0, x]`. The GCD approach misses critical scenarios where the frog might still be able to reach certain positions, particularly when `m` is less than `k`. The annotations specifically mention that if `m` is less than `k`, it returns a triangular number formula for `m`, which doesn't capture all reachable positions accurately.

3. The calculation of `sum_k` and `sum_m` in the case where `m >= k` does not ensure that all reachable integers are counted correctly, especially if there are unreachable integers between `0` and `m` that the jumping rules would prevent the frog from reaching.

4. There is a failure to account for specific edge cases where the interplay between `a` and `b` could lead to different reachable integers, which isn't captured by simply calculating the sums in the manner shown.

For example:
- If `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the function does not correctly check for all integers that can be reached. The reachable integers need to be calculated based on the combinatorial ability of the frog to jump within the bounds, which the current implementation does not handle correctly, as shown in the output example where the expected output should be `10` but the code's logic fails to account for specific reachable positions accurately.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is false.
