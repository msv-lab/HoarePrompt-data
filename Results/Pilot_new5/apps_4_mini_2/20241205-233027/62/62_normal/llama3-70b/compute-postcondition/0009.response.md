The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, where each digit is between 0 and `base - 1`. `base` is an integer that can take any value between 2 and 40. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `result`, which is the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and return the numerical value represented by those digits in the given base. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, returning the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base`.**
