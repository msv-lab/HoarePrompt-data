According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute for the second element of the list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 element and `digit` is the first element of `digits`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 2 elements, and `digit` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, `result` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the second element of `digits`**
