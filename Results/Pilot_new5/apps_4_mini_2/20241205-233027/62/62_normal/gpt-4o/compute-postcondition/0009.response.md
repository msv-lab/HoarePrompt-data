The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. The parameter `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, where each digit is non-negative and less than the base. The parameter `base` is an integer that must be between 2 and 40, inclusive. After executing the function body, the function returns `decimal_value`, which is equal to the value represented by `digits` in the specified base. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and return the equivalent decimal value of the number represented by `digits` in that base. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal value represented by `digits` in the specified base.**
