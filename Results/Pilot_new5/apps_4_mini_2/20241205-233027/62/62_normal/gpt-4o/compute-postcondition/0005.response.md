According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 elements, and `digit` is the second element in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 elements, and `digit` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * base + digit`, `digit` is the third element of the `digits` list.**
