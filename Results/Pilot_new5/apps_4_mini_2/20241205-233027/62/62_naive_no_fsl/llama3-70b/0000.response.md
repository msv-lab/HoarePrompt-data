Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts the numbers represented in different bases to their decimal equivalents and compares them according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads two numbers, X and Y, along with their bases, `bx` and `by`.
2. It uses the `func_1` function to convert the digit lists representing the numbers from their respective bases to decimal integers.
3. The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base, calculates the decimal equivalent by iterating over the digits, and returns the result.
4. After obtaining the decimal values of both numbers, it compares them using standard comparison operators and prints the appropriate symbol (<, >, =).

### Edge Cases Handled:
- The program adheres to the constraints provided (e.g., no leading zeroes, valid digit ranges).
- It correctly handles cases where the bases are different as specified in the problem statement.

Since I cannot find any input cases where the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
