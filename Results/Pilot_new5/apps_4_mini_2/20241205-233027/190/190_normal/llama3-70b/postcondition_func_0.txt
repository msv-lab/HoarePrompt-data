The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It calculates the minimum cost to align all stick lengths to a single value `t`, where `t` can be any integer from 1 to 100. The function finds the optimal `t` that results in the lowest cost, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length and `t`. Finally, it prints the optimal `t` and the corresponding minimum cost. If `n` is 0 or if the list is not properly formed, the function’s behavior might be undefined, as it does not handle such edge cases.
