Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_t` is equal to `4`, `i` is 4, and `cost` is updated to the sum of min(abs(x - 4), abs(x - 3)) for x in `sticks`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`.***
