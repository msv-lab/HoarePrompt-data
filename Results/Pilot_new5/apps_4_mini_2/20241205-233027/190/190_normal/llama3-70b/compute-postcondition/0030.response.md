Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`, `i` starts at `mid + 1` which is at least `2`, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks, if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to `i`.***
