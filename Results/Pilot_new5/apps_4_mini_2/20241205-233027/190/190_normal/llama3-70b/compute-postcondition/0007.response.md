`min_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The variable `t` is equal to `mid`, which in turn is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`. Therefore, `min_t` is now equal to `sticks[n // 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input; `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`.**
