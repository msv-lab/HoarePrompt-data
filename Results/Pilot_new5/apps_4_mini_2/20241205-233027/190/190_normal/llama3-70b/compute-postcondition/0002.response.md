The `sticks.sort()` function sorts the list `sticks` in ascending order. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `sticks` are not directly affected by this operation, but the order of the elements in `sticks` will change. The values of `n` and `a` remain the same, as they are not modified by the sort operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input.**
