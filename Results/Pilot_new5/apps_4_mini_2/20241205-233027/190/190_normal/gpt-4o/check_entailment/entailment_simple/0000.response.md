Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of sticks \( n \) and their respective lengths as specified. This part adheres to the input format given in the problem description.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates through all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100 (the upper limit for stick lengths) to determine the minimum cost for adjusting the stick lengths to be "almost good" relative to \( t \). 

   - For each stick length, it evaluates whether it needs to be increased or decreased to be within the range defined by \( t \):
     - If the stick length is less than \( t-1 \), it calculates the cost to increase it to \( t-1 \).
     - If the stick length is greater than \( t+1 \), it calculates the cost to decrease it to \( t+1 \).
   - This logic is correctly implemented, ensuring that all stick lengths can be adjusted to be \( t-1 \), \( t \), or \( t+1 \) with minimal cost.

3. **Finding Optimal \( t \)**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost encountered and the corresponding \( t \) value. This is done using a comparison within the loop, consistently updating `min_cost` and `best_t` whenever a lower cost is found.

4. **Output**: After evaluating all possible values of \( t \), the program prints the optimal \( t \) alongside the minimum cost, which matches the required output format from the problem description.

The program thus successfully calculates both the optimal integer \( t \) and the minimum cost to make all stick lengths "almost good" relative to that \( t \), as required in the problem statement. Therefore, the implementation is correct and adheres to the problem requirements for all cases within the specified constraints.
