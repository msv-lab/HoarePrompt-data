The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`, but since `t` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain its value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is less than the previous `min_cost`, which is now equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is equal to `t`; `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`.**
