Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the second integer in the list `a`; `t` is equal to 2. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 3` to its previous value.***
