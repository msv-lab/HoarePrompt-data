Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in list `a` with respect to `t`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`, `t` is equal to 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.**
