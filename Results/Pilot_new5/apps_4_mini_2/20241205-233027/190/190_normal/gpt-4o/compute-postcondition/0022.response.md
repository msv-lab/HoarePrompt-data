Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is positive infinity; `best_t` is -1; `length` is `a[i + 1]` where `i + 1 < n`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (a[i + 1] - (t + 1))`.***
