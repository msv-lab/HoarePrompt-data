Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is increased by (1 - length) if `length` is less than 1. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus (length - 3). `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `length` is the first integer in list `a`, with `t` equal to 2.***
