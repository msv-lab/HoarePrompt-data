Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and each integer in `a` is between `1` and `100`. It calculates the minimum cost required to adjust the values in `a` so that they all lie within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]` for `t` ranging from `1` to `100`, and returns the value of `t` that results in the minimum cost along with that minimum cost. The function prints `best_t` and `min_cost` as the output. **
