According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the variable `t` from 1 to 100. The loop can execute one more time if `t` is less than 100. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `t` becoming 2. 

Since the loop runs while `t` is less than or equal to 100, the only condition needed for the loop to execute again is that `t` must be less than 100. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, current_cost is the sum of the costs calculated for all elements in `a` based on the given conditions, min_cost is updated to `current_cost`, best_t is set to 1, t is 2**
