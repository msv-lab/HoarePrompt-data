The provided code aims to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, based on the problem description. 

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The code reads an integer \( n \) and iteratively tests values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
2. The function `func_1(num)` checks if a given number \( num \) is prime: it returns `False` if \( num \) is less than 2 or if \( num \) has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
3. The loop breaks upon encountering the first \( m \) for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

### Potential Edge Cases
- The code correctly handles cases where \( n \) is such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) becomes a composite number. However, we need to ensure it works for all values of \( n \) from 1 to 1000.
- The check for prime in `func_1` is generally efficient, as it uses trial division up to the square root of the number.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state:
- The function returns `False` for numbers less than 2 or if the number is not prime, and `True` for prime numbers.
- It mentions that the function does not explicitly check for even numbers except for 2, but in this context, it is not a significant issue since even numbers greater than 2 are inherently not prime.

### Conclusion
The code appears to work as intended based on the description. It effectively finds an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime by utilizing a straightforward approach. The edges are adequately handled since the loop will eventually find a composite value for the given range.

Since I cannot identify any specific case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that it adheres to the specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
