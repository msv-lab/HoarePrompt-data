To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements
1. The input is a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
2. The program must find a positive integer \( m \) (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is **not** a prime number.
3. The output should be this integer \( m \).

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads an integer \( n \).
2. It iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is prime using the function `func_1`.
4. If `func_1` returns `False`, which indicates that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.

### Function `func_1` Breakdown:
- The function checks if a given number `num` is prime:
  - It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2.
  - It checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If it finds any factor, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The function correctly checks for the primality of `n \cdot m + 1`.
- The loop iterates through all possible values of \( m \) up to 1000.
- Since we are guaranteed by the problem statement that a suitable \( m \) exists, the program will always find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
- The program correctly prints the first \( m \) that satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description and will always produce a valid output for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
