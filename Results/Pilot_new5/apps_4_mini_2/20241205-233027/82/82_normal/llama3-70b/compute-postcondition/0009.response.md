Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues to swap the values of `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero, at which point it returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original inputs. The function correctly handles the input constraints of 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. **
