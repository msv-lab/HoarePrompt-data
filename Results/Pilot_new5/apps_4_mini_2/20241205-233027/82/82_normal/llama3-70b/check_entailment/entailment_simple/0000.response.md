To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Neko wants to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) giving the same minimal LCM, he should choose the smallest \( k \).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)}
     \]
   - This is implemented in `func_2` where it calls `func_1` to compute the GCD.

3. **Finding Minimum LCM**:
   - The program initializes \( k = 0 \) and computes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) using `func_2`.
   - It enters a loop, continuously checking if the LCM can be reduced by incrementing \( k \). If a smaller LCM is found, it updates the minimum LCM and continues to the next \( k \).
   - The loop breaks when a larger or equal LCM is encountered, and then it prints \( k - 1 \) (to get the last \( k \) that produced the minimum LCM).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program aims to minimize the LCM and chooses the smallest \( k \) when multiple minimum LCMs exist, which aligns with the problem requirements.
   - However, the program prints \( k - 1 \) at the end. If the loop breaks because the current \( k \) does not reduce the LCM, it means the last valid \( k \) was actually \( k - 1 \). The problem statement requires the smallest \( k \) that gives the minimum LCM, hence printing \( k - 1 \) can be incorrect, especially if \( k = 0 \).

### Potential Flaw:
- **Boundary Condition**: If the loop breaks at \( k = 0 \) because the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) is already the smallest, the program would print \( -1 \), which is not valid.
- The program does not ensure that it checks all possible \( k \) values including zero adequately; once it finds a non-decreasing condition, it stops.
  
### Conclusion:
The program does not always return the correct \( k \) as required by the problem description because it incorrectly adjusts the value of \( k \) when determining the minimum LCM.

Correctness: **False**
