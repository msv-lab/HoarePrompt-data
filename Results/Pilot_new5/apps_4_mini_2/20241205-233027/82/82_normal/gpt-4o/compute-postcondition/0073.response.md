According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`, which contains two candidates. The loop variable `candidate` will take on the values of `k` and `diff // k` in that order. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` would have taken the first value (either `k` or `diff // k`), and you need to prepare for the next iteration.

Since `candidate` is now set to either `k` or `diff // k`, in the next iteration, it will take the next value from the list.

1. If `candidate` was `k`, then in the next iteration, it will be `diff // k`.
2. If `candidate` was `diff // k`, then the loop will terminate after this iteration since there are no more elements in the list to iterate over.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to set `candidate` to the next value in the sequence, which is the second value in the list.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
