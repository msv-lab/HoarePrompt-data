The variable `new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `candidate` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(a + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1`, which is simply `a`. Thus, `new_a` will take on the value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is 1, and `new_a` is equal to `a`.**
