According to the code, the loop iterates over two candidates derived from the variable `k` and `diff // k`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the values of `k` and `diff`. Since `k` is currently equal to `current_k + 1`, it must be adjusted to reflect the next iteration's candidate.

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `candidate` can either be `k` or `diff // k`.
- The loop has already processed one candidate, which means the next candidate will be the second one in the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` must be updated to the other value in the list, which will be `diff // k` if the last candidate was `k`, or `k` if the last candidate was `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is less than or equal to `min_lcm`, `min_k` is either `candidate` or remains unchanged**
