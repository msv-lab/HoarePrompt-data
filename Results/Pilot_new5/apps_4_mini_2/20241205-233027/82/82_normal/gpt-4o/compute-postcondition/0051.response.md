To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the changes that occur as a result of the `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` line.

1. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are defined as the nearest multiples of 2 that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since both `a` and `b` are positive integers, `new_a` and `new_b` will also be positive integers and will not affect the positivity condition.
  
2. The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` will compute a value based on the inputs `new_a` and `new_b`, and this value will be assigned to `current_lcm`.

3. The variable `current_lcm` is updated to hold the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged; specifically, `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidate` retain their original values. The main change is the assignment of the output from `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the updated `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is 2, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b)**.
