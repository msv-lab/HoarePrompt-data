The code assigns a new value to `new_b`, calculated as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The previous value of `b` is still valid, and `candidate` remains unchanged, while `new_a` was already calculated before this code snippet.

Given that `new_b` is updated, it will now hold the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is derived from `diff // k` with `diff` being at least 2, `new_b` will also be a positive integer.

The output state will include the updated value of `new_b` while retaining the values of the other defined variables.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_b` is now updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
