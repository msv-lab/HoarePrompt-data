Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(a, b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is 1, `new_a` is equal to `a`, and `new_b` is equal to `b`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is updated to 1.***
