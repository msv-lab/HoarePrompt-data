Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b). If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
