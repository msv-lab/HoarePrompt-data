According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. The previous condition states that `k` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. The next value for `k` would be 2, and the loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

Since `k` is currently 1, the loop can execute again if `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than 1, which it must be because `diff` is a positive integer.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `diff` is divisible by 2, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated across all candidates, with `min_k` as the candidate that gave this minimum value, and `k` is 2.**
