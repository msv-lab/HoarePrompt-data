The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of `current_lcm`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `min_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
