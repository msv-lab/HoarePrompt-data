Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers with `diff` at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is 2, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b). If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to 2.***
