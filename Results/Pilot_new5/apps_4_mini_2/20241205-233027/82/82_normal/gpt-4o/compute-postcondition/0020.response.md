The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
