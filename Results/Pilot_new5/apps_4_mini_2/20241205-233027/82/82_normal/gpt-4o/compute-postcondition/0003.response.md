The variable `diff` is assigned the value `abs(a - b)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is not equal to `b`, the value of `diff` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`**.
