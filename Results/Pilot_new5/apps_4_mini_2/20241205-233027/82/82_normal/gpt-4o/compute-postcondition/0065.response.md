Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to equal `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is updated to equal `candidate`, with `current_k` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) - 1` and `k` equal to `current_k + 1` which is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.***
