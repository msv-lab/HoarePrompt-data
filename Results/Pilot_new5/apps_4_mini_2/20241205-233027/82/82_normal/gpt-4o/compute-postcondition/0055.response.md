Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated across candidates, and `min_k` is the candidate that gave this minimum value.**
