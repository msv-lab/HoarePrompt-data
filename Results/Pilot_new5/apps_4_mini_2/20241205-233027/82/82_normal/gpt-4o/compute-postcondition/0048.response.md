According to the code, the loop will execute for each value in the list `[k, diff // k]`. The variable `k` is 2, so the first value the loop will use for `candidate` is 2. The second value will be `diff // k`, which is the integer division of `diff` by 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is `diff // 2`. For the loop to execute again, it will need to take the next value from the list, which is `k`, since the loop iterates over two values: first `k` (2) and then `diff // k`.

Since the last value of `candidate` is `diff // k`, it implies that the next iteration will use `k` (2) again. 

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is 2, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b).**
