The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both greater than 0, and returns the result of the expression `x` multiplied by `y` divided by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. If `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, this would result in a division by zero error. Therefore, the function may raise an error if `func_1` does not handle its internal logic correctly or returns 0.
