Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, representing the total number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the segment of tabs to keep open defined by indices `l` and `r`. It calculates the number of tabs to close based on the cursor's position relative to the open segment and prints this number. If the cursor is left of the open segment, it counts how many tabs need to be opened to reach `l`. If it's right of the segment, it counts how many tabs need to be closed to reach `r`. Additionally, it accounts for the tabs preceding `l` and succeeding `r`, ensuring it handles edge cases where the cursor is outside the defined segment. **
