The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the total number of tabs. 
- `pos` is an integer representing the current position of the cursor, with the constraint (1 ≤ pos ≤ n). 
- `l` is an integer representing the starting index of the segment to keep open, constrained to (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). 
- `r` is an integer representing the ending index of the segment to keep open, constrained to (1 ≤ r ≤ n). 

The function processes these inputs to return a specific output based on the values of the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, and performs operations to determine the state of tabs based on the cursor position and the segment defined by `l` and `r`.**
