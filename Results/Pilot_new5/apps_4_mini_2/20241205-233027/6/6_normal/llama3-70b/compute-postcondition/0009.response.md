The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`. The initial state mentions two scenarios for `ans`: it remains unchanged (0) if `pos ≤ r`, or it updates based on a calculation if `pos > r`. Since the code does not modify `ans` and simply prints its value, we need to specify the condition of `ans`.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers with `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, `1 ≤ r ≤ n`; `ans` is either unchanged (0) if `pos ≤ r` or `ans` is updated based on the condition `ans + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` if `pos > r`.**
