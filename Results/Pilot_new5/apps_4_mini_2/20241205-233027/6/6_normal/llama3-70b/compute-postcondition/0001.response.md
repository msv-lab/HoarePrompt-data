The code initializes `ans` to 0. The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` retain their previous values as they are unaffected by the assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `pos` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), `r` is assigned an input integer within the range (1 ≤ r ≤ n), `ans` is 0.**
