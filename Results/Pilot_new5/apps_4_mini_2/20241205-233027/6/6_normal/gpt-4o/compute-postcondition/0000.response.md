Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are assigned new integer values based on the input.**
