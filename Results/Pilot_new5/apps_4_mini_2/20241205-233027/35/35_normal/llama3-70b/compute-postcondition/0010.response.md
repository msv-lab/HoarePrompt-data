The operation `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. The conditions provided in the initial state indicate that `x` will only be decremented if certain criteria regarding `a`, `b`, and `x` are met. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we can only indicate that `x` has been reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; if `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `x` is decremented by 1.**
