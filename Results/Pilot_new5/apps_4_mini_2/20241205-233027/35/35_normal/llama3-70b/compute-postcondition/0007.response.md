According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it can execute indefinitely and there are no conditions that would prevent it from ongoing. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is decremented by 1**
