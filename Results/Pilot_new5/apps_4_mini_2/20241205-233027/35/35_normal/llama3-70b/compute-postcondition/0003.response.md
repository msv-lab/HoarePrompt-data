Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The current values of the variables are such that `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`.***
