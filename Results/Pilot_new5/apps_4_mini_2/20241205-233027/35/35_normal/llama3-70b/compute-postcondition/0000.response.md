The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `n`, `a`, and `b` based on user input. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be integers provided by the user through space-separated input. Prior to this code execution, we know `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `a` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and `b` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ b ≤ 100. 

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the integers provided by the user, but we don't have specific values for these integers yet. The conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` must still hold true, particularly that `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b after the execution. 

Therefore, the output state must reflect that `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to user-defined integers while still adhering to the existing constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and `b` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100.**
