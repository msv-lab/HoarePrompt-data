Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, then `low` is updated to `((min(a, b) + 2) // 2) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` remains as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, if `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, then `low` is set to 1, `high` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` remains as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`.***
