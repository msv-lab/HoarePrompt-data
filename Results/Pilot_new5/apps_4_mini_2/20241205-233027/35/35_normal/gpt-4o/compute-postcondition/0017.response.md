Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is no longer valid. Otherwise, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is recalculated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
