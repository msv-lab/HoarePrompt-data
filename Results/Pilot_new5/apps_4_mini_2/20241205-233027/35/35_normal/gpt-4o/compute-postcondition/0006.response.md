The value of `high` is updated to the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, which equates to an integer that is at least 1 and at most `min(a, b)`. Since `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, it implies that `mid` cannot be used effectively for distribution based on the constraints provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is 1, `high` is equal to `mid` (which is (min(a, b) + 2) // 2), `mid` is equal to (min(a, b) + 2) // 2, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns false.**
