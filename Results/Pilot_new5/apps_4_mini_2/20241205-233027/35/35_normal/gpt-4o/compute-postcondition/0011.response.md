The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means that `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, floored to the nearest integer. Therefore, after this assignment, the value of `high` will become equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
