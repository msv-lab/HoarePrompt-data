The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified but are defined such that `low` must be less than `high`, resulting in a value for `mid` that is the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down if necessary. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
