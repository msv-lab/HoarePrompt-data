#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100), `mid` is not valid because the loop has terminated, and the final value of `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1` or less, based on the last evaluation of `can_distribute(mid)`. If `can_distribute(mid)` was true for the final iteration, `low` would be `min(a, b) + 2`, otherwise, it will be equal to the last value of `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to the last value of high or min(a, b) + 2, and since high is equal to min(a, b) + 1 or less, the program returns a value that is at least min(a, b) or less.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is constrained such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake (both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to determine the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed equally based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function. It returns `low - 1`, which represents the largest number that can be distributed from the pieces of both cakes, ensuring the result is at most `min(a, b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes respectively, and x is a positive integer such that x <= min(a, b) and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the integer division of 'a' by 'x' and 'b' by 'x' is greater than or equal to 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of complete pieces that can be made from two cakes (with sizes `a` and `b`) when each piece has a size of `x` is at least `n`. The function does not enforce any constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` outside what is expected by the user, such as ensuring `x` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`. Additionally, if `x` is 0 or negative, the division would lead to incorrect behavior, but this scenario is not handled in the code.
