To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and how it relates to the task of calculating the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw without a guide for `n` squares.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Understanding segments in squares**:
   - To draw a square, Sofia needs to draw 4 segments: 2 vertical and 2 horizontal.
   - The first square requires drawing all 4 segments with a ruler (2 segments of each type).
   - For every additional square drawn adjacent to an existing square, Sofia can reuse one or more segments, thus minimizing the number of segments she needs to draw manually.

2. **Mathematical Pattern**:
   - After analyzing the examples given:
     - For 1 square: Needs 2 segments.
     - For 2 squares: Needs 3 segments.
     - For 4 squares: Needs 4 segments.
   - It can be observed that the number of segments required tends to form a relationship based on the arrangement of the squares (like filling in a rectangle).

### Program Logic
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - The function iterates through potential widths `a` of the rectangle that can be formed with the squares.
   - For each width `a`, it calculates the corresponding height `b` such that `a * b` is at least `n` (i.e., how many rows are needed given the number of squares).
   - It computes the number of segments required for each `(a, b)` combination as `2 * (a + b)`.
   - It keeps track of the minimum segments needed across all combinations.

### Correctness Check
- The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which ensures that it checks all possible rectangular configurations for `n` squares.
- The calculation of segments as `2 * (a + b)` captures the correct logic for the segments needed based on the current configuration.
- The program returns the minimum value found, which effectively mimics Sofia's process of minimizing the segments that need to be drawn with a ruler.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of segments Sofia needs to draw for any given `n` squares, adhering to the problem description.

Thus, the output should be:

Correctness: **True**
