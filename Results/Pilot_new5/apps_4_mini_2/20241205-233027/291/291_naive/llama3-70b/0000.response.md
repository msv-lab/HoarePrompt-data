To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the function and evaluate if it handles all possible cases correctly.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw `n` squares. 

The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. This essentially gives us the power of 2 that is just greater than `n`. For example:
   - If `n = 1`, `bit_length` is 1 (2^0), and the output will be `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2`.
   - If `n = 2`, `bit_length` is 2 (2^1), and the output will be `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4`.
   - If `n = 3`, `bit_length` is 2 (2^1), and the output will be `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4`.
   - If `n = 4`, `bit_length` is 3 (2^2), and the output will be `2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 6`.

From the examples above, we can see that the calculated output does not match the expected outputs based on the problem description. 

**Key Cases:**
- For `n = 1`, required segments = 2 (expected) -> Output = 2 (correct).
- For `n = 2`, required segments = 3 (expected) -> Output = 4 (incorrect).
- For `n = 4`, required segments = 4 (expected) -> Output = 6 (incorrect).

Since the program does not produce the correct output for several values of `n`, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly, particularly evident with inputs like `n = 2` and `n = 4`, where the expected number of segments is not matched by the output of the function.
