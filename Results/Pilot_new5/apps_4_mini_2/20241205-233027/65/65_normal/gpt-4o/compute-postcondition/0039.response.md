Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of balloons and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of friends, along with a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters that represent the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color and determines if it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no friend receives more balloons of the same color than `k`. If this distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This function does not return any value, it only outputs results based on the distribution logic.**
