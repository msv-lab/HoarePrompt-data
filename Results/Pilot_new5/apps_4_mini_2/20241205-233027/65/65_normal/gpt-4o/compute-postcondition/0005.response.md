The code `color_count[color] += 1` increments the count of occurrences of the character `color` in the dictionary `color_count`. The variable `color` is known to be the first character in the string `s` and is guaranteed to be an element in the `color_count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length at least 1, `color` is the first character in `s`, and `color` is an element in `color_count`; `color_count[color]` is increased by 1.**
