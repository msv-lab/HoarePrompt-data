Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` has at least 2 key-value pairs. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
