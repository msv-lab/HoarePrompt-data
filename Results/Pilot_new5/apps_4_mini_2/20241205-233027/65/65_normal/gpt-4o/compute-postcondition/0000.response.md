The code assigns the values for `n` and `k` by taking input, which is split into two integers. The string `s` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected, so we will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` after the input is processed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons, with `n` and `k` being assigned values from input.**
