The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were assigned from input before this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.**
