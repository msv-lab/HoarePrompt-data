The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take a user-provided string input of length `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are positive integers representing the number of balloons and friends, respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.**
