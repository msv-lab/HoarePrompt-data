The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping the integer input from the user split into two parts. The value of `s` remains unchanged and the previous information about its length is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of baloons, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the baloons, where `n` and `k` are now both input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of baloons, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the baloons, where `n` and `k` are now both input integers.**
