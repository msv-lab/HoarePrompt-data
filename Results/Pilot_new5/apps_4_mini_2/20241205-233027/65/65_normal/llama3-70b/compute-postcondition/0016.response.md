Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is the character at index `i`, where `i` is less than `n`. If `c` is already in `color_count`, then `color_count[c]` is increased by 1. If `c` is not in `color_count`, then `color_count[c]` is set to 1.***
