Output State: **`color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the string `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that color in `s`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `s` is a string of length `n`. If `s` is an empty string, then `color_count` remains empty.**
