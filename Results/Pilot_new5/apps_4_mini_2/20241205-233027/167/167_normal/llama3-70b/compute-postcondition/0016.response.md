The variables `px` and `py` are assigned the values of `nx` and `ny` respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot know their exact values. However, the variables `px` and `py` now take on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `v` is the third integer in the list `a`, `px` is now equal to `nx`, `py` is now equal to `ny`.**
