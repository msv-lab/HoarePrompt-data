Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `count` is 1, and `n` is 1. If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without performing any action related to this condition.***
