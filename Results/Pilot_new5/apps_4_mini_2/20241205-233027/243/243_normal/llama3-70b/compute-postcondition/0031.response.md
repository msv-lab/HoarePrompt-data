The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an ambiguous integer (defined as `n + 1`); `ans` contains previous elements plus the current value of `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
