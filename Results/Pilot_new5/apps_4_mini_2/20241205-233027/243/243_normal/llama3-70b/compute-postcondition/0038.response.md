The function `func` does not accept any parameters and operates without input values. Given that `m` is specified as an integer with the constraint of 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, it implies the function may internally define or utilize `m` based on those constraints. However, since the function does not take `m` as an argument, it is not exposed as a parameter in the function signature.

Without further output or information about what the function returns, the functionality cannot be fully determined. If we assume the function does something with `m` internally, it is important to note that the behavior of the function would depend entirely on its implementation, which is not provided here.

Therefore, based on the current information:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It may operate internally with an integer `m` constrained between 1 and 100000, but since no output or behavior is described, the specific functionality cannot be determined.**
