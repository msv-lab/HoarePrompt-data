The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` is an updated list containing the previous elements plus the current value of `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
