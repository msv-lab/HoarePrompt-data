Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) from input. It determines how many integers from 1 up to the largest integer `n` such that `n // 5^count < m` (where `count` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5^count >= m`) can be accommodated. It prints the count of these integers and the integers themselves. Specifically, it prints the count of integers from 1 to `n-1`, where `n` is the first integer for which `n // 5^count` is no longer greater than or equal to `m`. If `m` is 1, it will print 4 integers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. If `m` is greater than 1, it will dynamically determine the appropriate range based on the value of `m`.**
