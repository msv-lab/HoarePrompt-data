The variable `n` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state states that `n` is equal to `n + 1`, it creates a paradox; thus, `n` is not defined in a conventional manner. The variable `ans` contains the previous elements plus the current value of `n`. The value of `ans` would depend on the previous state of `n`. However, since `n` is ambiguous and undefined, we cannot definitively state the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an ambiguous integer (defined as n + 1); `ans` contains previous elements plus the current value of `n`**.
