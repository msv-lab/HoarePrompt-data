According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value returned by `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

Right before the loop, we know:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
- `left` is defined as `mid`, and `mid` is calculated using `low` and `high`, ensuring that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Since `func_1(left)` is assigned the value at the start (before the loop) as `zeroes`, we need to ensure that `zeroes` is equal to `m` in order for the loop to execute at least once. If `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, if `zeroes` is not already equal to `m`, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is. 

Given that `zeroes` is assigned the value of `func_1(mid)` and `mid` is derived from `low` and `high`, we do not have any direct information about the output of `func_1(left)` except that it must equal `m` for the loop to run.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `mid`**
