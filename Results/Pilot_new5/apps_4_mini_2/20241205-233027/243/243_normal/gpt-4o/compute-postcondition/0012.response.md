The variable `result` is assigned an empty list, but the previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.
