The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or conditional structure we are currently within. The states of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State will retain the original values of the variables as no new assignments or calculations are made.

Output State: **`func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
