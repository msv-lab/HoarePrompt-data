The function `func_1(mid)` is called, and the output of this function is assigned to the variable `zeroes`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, and `result` remain unchanged, while the value of `mid` is determined by the expression `(5 * m + 5) // 2`. The value of `zeroes` will depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the calculated value of `mid`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.**
