Output State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed and `func_1(left)` must be less than `m` now, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.**
