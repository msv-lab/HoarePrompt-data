The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `left` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - 1, and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.**
