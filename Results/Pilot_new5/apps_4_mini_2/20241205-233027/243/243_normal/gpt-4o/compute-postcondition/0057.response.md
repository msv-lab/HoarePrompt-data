Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.***
