The `result` variable is initialized as an empty list. The values of `m`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State retains the information about `m`, `low`, and `high`, while updating `result`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list.**
