The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `left`, `mid`, `func_1`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, and `result` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`, and `right` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`, and `right` is incremented by 1.**
