Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is updated to 0, `segments` is increased to 2, and `digit` remains as the second character of `ticket`.***
