The value of `curr_sum` is set to 0. The previous value of `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, which is `total_sum // 2`. Therefore, after execution, `curr_sum` is now 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is the first character of `ticket`.**
