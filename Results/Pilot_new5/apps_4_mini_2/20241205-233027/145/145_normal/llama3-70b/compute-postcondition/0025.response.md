The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive. After executing the function body, if the total sum of the digits in `ticket` is odd, the function returns `False`, indicating that the condition related to the sum of the digits is not satisfied. If the total sum of the digits is even and the number of segments is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `True`, indicating that the sum of segments in the ticket equals the target sum at least twice. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `ticket` and return whether the sum of its segments meets certain conditions based on the parity of the total sum and the number of segments. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ticket (a string of digits) and returns False if the total sum of the digits is odd. If the total sum is even and the number of segments is greater than or equal to 2, it returns True.**
