In this case, `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits in the string `ticket`. The value of `ticket` is a string of digits, so `sum(ticket)` calculates the sum of its integer representations. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `ticket` consists of digits, the `total_sum` would be an integer equal to the sum of all digits in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length n (where 2 <= n <= 100) and each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
