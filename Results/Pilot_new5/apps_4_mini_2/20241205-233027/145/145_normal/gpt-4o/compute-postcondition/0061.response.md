The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 1, so the new value becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 2; `segment_length` is `n - 1`; `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`; `i` is 1.
