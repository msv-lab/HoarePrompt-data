The value of `current_sum` is assigned a new value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was `0 + int(ticket[1])`. Since the code explicitly sets `current_sum` to `0`, its previous value is overwritten. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 1; `segment_length` is `n - 1`; `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`; `i` is 1.**
