Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, and `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`. If `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `current_sum` becomes 0, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `current_sum` remains unchanged, and `segment_count` remains the same.***
