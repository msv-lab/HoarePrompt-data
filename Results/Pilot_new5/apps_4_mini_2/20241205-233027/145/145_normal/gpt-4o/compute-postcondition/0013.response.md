`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` remains unchanged, so now it will be the initial value plus one. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1.
