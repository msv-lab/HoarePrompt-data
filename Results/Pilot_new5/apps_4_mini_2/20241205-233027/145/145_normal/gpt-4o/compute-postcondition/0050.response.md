The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state indicates that `current_sum` was not equal to `0`, but since it is updated to `0`, it overrides its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `current_sum` is now `0`; `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1; `segment_length` is `n - 1`; `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `current_sum` is now 0; `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1; `segment_length` is `n - 1`; `target_sum` is `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`.**
