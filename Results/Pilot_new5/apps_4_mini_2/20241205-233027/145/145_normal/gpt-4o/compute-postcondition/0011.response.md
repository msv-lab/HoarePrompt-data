The variable `current_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of the digit in `ticket` at the index `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `current_sum` becomes the integer value of the first digit of `ticket` plus the integer value of the second digit of `ticket`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket` plus the integer value of the second digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**
