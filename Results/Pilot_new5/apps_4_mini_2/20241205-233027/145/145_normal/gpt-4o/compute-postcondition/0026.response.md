The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. This value replaces whatever value `current_sum` previously held, which was not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `segment_length` is 2; `target_sum` is equal to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is the number of times `current_sum` reached `target_sum` during the iteration over the digits of `ticket`.**
