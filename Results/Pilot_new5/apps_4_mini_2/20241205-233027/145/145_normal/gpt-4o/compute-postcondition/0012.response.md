The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. This directly updates the value of `current_sum`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The previous values are still valid, and the only change is to `current_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**
