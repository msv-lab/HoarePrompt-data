The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`, which replaces its previous value of `int(ticket[2])`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2**.
