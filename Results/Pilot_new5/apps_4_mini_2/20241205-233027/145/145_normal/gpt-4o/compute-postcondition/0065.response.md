The code assigns `current_sum` the value of `0`. Since `current_sum` was previously `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`, this indicates that `current_sum` has now been reset to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `target_sum` is still `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`, `i` is 2.**
