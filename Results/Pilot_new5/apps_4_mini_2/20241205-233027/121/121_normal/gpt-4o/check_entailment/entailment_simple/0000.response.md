Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description in every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Initial Check on n**: The program correctly checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If it is not, it immediately prints '===' and returns, which is correct since having an unequal distribution of the four nucleotides is impossible if `n` is not a multiple of 4.

2. **Counting Existing Nucleotides**: The program counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' correctly, which is necessary for determining how many of each nucleotide need to be added.

3. **Exceeding Target Check**: The program checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the `target_count`. If it does, it prints '===' and returns, which is also correct.

4. **Replacing '?' with Nucleotides**: Here is where the program fails. The algorithm runs through the string and replaces '?' with nucleotides that are underrepresented up to the `target_count`. However, it does not check whether there are enough '?' to reach the `target_count` for each nucleotide type.

### Problematic Case:
Consider the input:
```
8
A??C????
```
In this case, the counts after the first loop would be:
- `A`: 1
- `C`: 1
- `G`: 0
- `T`: 0

The `target_count` is 2 for each nucleotide (since `8 // 4 = 2`). 

The program would replace the '?' characters with 'G' and 'T' as needed. However, it could potentially fill all '?' with either 'G' or 'T' without balancing the counts, leading to an incorrect output. For example, if all '?' are replaced with 'G', the result could be 'AGCGGGG?', which is not a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the number of each nucleotide becomes equal by adequately managing the replacement of '?' characters in situations where they outnumber the required nucleotides. As such, it does not satisfy the problem's requirement to decode the genome correctly in all cases. 

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**.
