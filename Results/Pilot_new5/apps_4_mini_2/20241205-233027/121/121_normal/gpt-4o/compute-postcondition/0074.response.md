Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `result` is a list containing unique characters from `s`. If `result[i]` is equal to '?', then `result` is updated to include the next unique character from `s` based on the current state of `counts`, which reflects the character counts less than `target_count`. If no more characters can be added that meet the condition, `result` may contain '?' for the remaining indices.***
