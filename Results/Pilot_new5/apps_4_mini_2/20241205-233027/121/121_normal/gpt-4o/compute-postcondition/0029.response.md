Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a dictionary containing counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and `char` is the next character in the counts. If the count of `char` in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, the program also does not return any value.***
