The code `count[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the dictionary `count`. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` represent the counts for characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', respectively, and one of these counts (corresponding to `c`) will be incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `count` will remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `count` remains {'A': x, 'C': y, 'G': z, 'T': w} with one of the values incremented by 1 (count[c] is updated).**
