The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` has been updated with `count[nc]` decreased by 1; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `c` is the next character in `s`; `res` remains as it was increased by `nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
