The code `res += c` assigns the value of `c` to `res`, effectively appending `c` to `res`. The initial state indicates that `c` is a character in `s` that is not '?', but it does not specify the current value of `res`. Therefore, `res` will now include the character `c`.

The values of `n`, `avg`, and `count` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers, `c` is a character in `s` that is not '?', `res` is updated to include `c`.**
