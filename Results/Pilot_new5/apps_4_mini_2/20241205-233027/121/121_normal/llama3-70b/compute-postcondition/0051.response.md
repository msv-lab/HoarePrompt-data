Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `c` is the next character in `s`, and if `count[nc]` is greater than 0 then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, `res` is increased by `nc`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
