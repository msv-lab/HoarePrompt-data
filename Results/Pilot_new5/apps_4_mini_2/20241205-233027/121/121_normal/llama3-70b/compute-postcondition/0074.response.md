The variable `res` is incremented by adding `nc` to it. The value of `nc` is determined to be the next character in 'ACGT' after the current one, which suggests that previously, there was some character in 'ACGT' assigned to `nc`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers; `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' after the current one; `res` is updated to `res + nc`.**
