Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, and `res` contains the original string `s` with all occurrences of '?' replaced by characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' according to the counts in `count`, if possible. At least one of the values in `count` is greater than 0.***
