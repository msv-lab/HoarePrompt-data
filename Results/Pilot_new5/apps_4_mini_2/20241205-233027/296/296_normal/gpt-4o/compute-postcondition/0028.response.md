The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. After executing the function body, if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns 'NO' indicating that there are no divisors. Otherwise, the function returns 'YES', along with the count of the divisors 'k', and a list of tuples (1, d) for each divisor 'd' in 'divisors'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return whether it has divisors, indicating if it is prime or not, along with the relevant details about its divisors when applicable.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 2. If n is a prime number, it returns 'NO' indicating no divisors exist. Otherwise, it returns 'YES', followed by the count of divisors and a list of tuples representing each divisor.**
