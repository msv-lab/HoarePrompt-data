`fractions` is assigned a list of tuples where each tuple consists of the integer `1` and an element `d` from the list `divisors`. The list `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `k` is equal to the length of this list. Therefore, `fractions` will contain `k` tuples, each of the form `(1, d)` for each divisor `d`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9; `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`; `k` is a positive integer equal to `len(divisors)`; `fractions` is a list of tuples `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`.**
