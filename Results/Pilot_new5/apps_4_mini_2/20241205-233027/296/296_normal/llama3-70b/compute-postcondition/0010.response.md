The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on a positive integer `n`, which must satisfy the constraint that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Since there is no specified output in the provided information, we cannot determine any return values. Without specific output details, we recognize that the function likely performs some operation related to `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates based on a positive integer n within the range of 2 to 10^9. The exact return value is not specified.**
