The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must remain a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 after this assignment. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will directly reflect that `n` is now the integer input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, assigned the value of the input integer.**
