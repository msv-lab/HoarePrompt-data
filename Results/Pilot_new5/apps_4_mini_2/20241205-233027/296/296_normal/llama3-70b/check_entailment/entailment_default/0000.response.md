The program is designed to check whether a sequence of fractions can be generated according to the given problem description. 

### Assessment of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`.
2. **Condition for n = 2**: It correctly identifies that for `n = 2`, a valid sequence cannot be formed and prints 'NO'.
3. **Condition for n > 2**: For any `n > 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by a hardcoded output indicating a sequence of two fractions, specifically \( \frac{1}{n//2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \).

### Checking the Conditions:
- The fractions' denominators, \( b_i \), must divide `n`, and must lie in the range \( 1 < b_i < n \).
- The numerators, \( a_i \), must satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).

### Edge Case Consideration:
- For `n = 3`, the output will be:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 1
  1 3
  ```
  The denominator `1` is not valid according to the condition \( 1 < b_i < n \).
  
- For `n = 4`, the output will be:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```
  Here, `b_i = 4` is not valid as it does not satisfy \( b_i < n \).

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that:
- For \( n = 2 \), it correctly prints 'NO'.
- For \( n > 2 \), it mentions a sequence that prints `1` and `n//2`, and `1` and `n`. However, this can lead to invalid fractions for several values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined. For many values of `n > 2`, it will produce invalid fractions and does not truly adhere to the required conditions of the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.
