Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 1). If `s[i]` is '[', `f` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ind` remains 0. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', and `f` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, `ind` is set to `i + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
