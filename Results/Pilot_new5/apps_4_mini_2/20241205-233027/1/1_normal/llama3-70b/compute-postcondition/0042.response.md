Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |. If the character at index `i` is ']', then `f` is set to True, `bind` remains -1, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is set to `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` is ':', then `bind` is set to `n - 1`, `f` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` remains `n - 1`, while the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
