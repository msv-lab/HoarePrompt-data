The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `f` is unchanged; `bind` is `n - 2`; `n` is unchanged; `i` is `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
