Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; if either `ind` or `bind` is -1, the output of the print statement is -1. Otherwise, if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, `print` outputs -1. If `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `ind` is a valid index in the string, `f` is True, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `ans` is calculated as 4 plus the count of '|' found between indices `ind + 1` and `bind.***
