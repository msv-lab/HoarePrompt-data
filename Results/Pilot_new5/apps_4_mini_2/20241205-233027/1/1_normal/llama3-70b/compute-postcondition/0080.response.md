Functionality: ** The function reads a string `s` containing lowercase letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It identifies the first occurrence of `:` after the first `[`, and the last occurrence of `:` before the last `]`. If either `:` does not exist in the expected positions, or if the first `:` is not before the last `:`, the function outputs -1. If valid indices are found, it counts the occurrences of `|` between these indices and returns that count plus 4. The function does not accept any parameters. **
