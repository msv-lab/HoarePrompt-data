Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; if `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is set to True, while `bind`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not ']', then `bind` is set to `n - 2`, while `f`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s[i]` is equal to ':', and if `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
