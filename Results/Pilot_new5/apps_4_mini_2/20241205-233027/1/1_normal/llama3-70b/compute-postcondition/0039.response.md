The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `bind` is `n - 1`; `f` is True; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']'; the character at index `i` of `s` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
