The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000, the value of `n` becomes the length of `s`, which is an integer between 1 and 500,000. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`, an integer between 1 and 500,000.**
