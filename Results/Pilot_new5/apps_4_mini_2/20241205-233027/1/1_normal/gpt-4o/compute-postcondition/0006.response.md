The execution of `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that we exit from the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 500000), `i` is 0, `ind` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
