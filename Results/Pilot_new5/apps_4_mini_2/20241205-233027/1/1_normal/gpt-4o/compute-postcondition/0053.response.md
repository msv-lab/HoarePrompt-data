The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `bind`. Since `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, and `i` is initially set to `bind`, the value of `end_colon` will be equal to `bind`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind`, `start_colon` is set to the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind`, `end_colon` is equal to `bind`, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is ':'**
