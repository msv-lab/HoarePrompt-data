Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is ':', then `start_colon` is set to the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind`, `end_colon` is equal to `bind`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
