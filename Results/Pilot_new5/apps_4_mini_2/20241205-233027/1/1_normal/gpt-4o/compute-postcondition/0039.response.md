The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `i` is `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' or -1 if ']' is not present in `s`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
