The value of `pipe_count` is incremented by 1, but it is not specified whether `pipe_count` had a previous value. Therefore, the output state only reflects that `pipe_count` has been increased by 1, without specifying its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is at least `ind + 3`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `pipe_count` is increased by 1.**
