Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is either the index of the first colon (`:`) found in the range from `bind - 1` down to `ind + 1` or remains -1 if no colon is found, `i` is `ind + 1`. The current value of `start_colon` is -1 or the current value of `end_colon` is -1 or the current value of `start_colon` is greater than or equal to the current value of `end_colon`.***
