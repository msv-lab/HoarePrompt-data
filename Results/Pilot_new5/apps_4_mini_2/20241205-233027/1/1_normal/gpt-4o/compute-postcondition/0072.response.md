Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is at least `start_colon + 2`, `i` is `ind + 1`, and if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is set to 1. If the character at index `i` is not '|', `pipe_count` remains 0.***
