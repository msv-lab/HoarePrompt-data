The code `print(-1)` does not modify any of the variables in the initial state but simply outputs `-1`. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is either the index of the first colon (`:`) found in the range from `bind - 1` down to `ind + 1` or remains -1 if no colon is found, `i` is `ind + 1`, and the output is -1.**
