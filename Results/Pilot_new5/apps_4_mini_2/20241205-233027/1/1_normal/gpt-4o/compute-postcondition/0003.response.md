According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 500000, the loop will definitely execute at least once. 

Before the first execution of the loop, the variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop and will increment by 1 during each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. The variable `ind` is -1, which does not affect the ability of the loop to execute; however, it may be relevant within the loop body.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed correctly:
- The input string `s` is provided, of which `n` is already defined as its length.
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0.

Thus, the required states to be adjusted before the loop starts are as follows:

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 500000), `i` is 0, and `ind` is -1**
