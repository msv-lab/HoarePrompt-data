According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `end_colon`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 2`. The loop will execute for the next value of `i`, which will be `ind + 3`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `end_colon`. Since `end_colon` is at least `ind + 3`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be at most `end_colon - 1`, which is consistent with the current value of `i` being `ind + 2`.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration of the loop:
- `i` will change from `ind + 2` to `ind + 3`.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is at least `ind + 3`, and `i` is `ind + 3`**.
