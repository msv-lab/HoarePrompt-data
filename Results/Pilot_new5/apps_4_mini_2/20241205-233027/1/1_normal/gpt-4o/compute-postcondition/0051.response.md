To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the loop condition step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1)`. The loop starts at `bind - 1` and decrements i until it reaches (but does not include) `ind`. This means the loop can only execute if `bind - 1` is greater than `ind`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `s` is an input string (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `ind` is a valid index (not equal to -1).
   - `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' or -1 if ']' is not present in `s` (not equal to -1).
   - `ind` is not equal to -1.
   - `bind` is not equal to -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`.
   - `start_colon` is set to the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` within the bounds defined by `bind`, or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range.
   - `end_colon` is -1.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, we need `bind - 1 > ind`. Since we know that `ind < bind`, we need to ensure that `bind - 1` is also greater than `ind`. This translates to:
     - `bind - 1` must be at least `ind + 1`, which implies `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted include ensuring `bind` is at least `ind + 2` for the loop to execute. 

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind`, `start_colon` is set to the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind`, `end_colon` is -1.**
