d is a positive integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), and each sofa is defined by its coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) where (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m). The last line contains four integers cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, and cnt_b where (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).
