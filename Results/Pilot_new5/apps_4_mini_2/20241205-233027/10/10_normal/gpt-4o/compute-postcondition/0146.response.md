Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 4, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[4]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `bottom_count[i]`.***
