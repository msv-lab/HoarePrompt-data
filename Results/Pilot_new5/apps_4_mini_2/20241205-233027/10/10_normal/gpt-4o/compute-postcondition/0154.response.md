The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that the initial state specifies `i` is 0, `target_sofa` will be calculated as 0 + 1, which equals 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, the value of `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, `target_sofa` is 1**.
