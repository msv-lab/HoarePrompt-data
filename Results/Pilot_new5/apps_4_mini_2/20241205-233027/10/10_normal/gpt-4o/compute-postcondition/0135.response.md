The variable `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `top_count[2]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3, and `top_count[2]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3, `top_count[2]` is incremented by 1**.
