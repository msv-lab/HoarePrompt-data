The variable `sofas` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged, as no operations affect them. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initialization of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer representing the dimensions of the storehouse, each of the next `d` lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa, and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the counts of sofas on the left, right, top, and bottom respectively; `sofas` is an empty list.**
