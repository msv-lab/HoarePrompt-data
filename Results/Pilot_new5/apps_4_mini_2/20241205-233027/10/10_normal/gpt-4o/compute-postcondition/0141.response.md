The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, indicating that we are modifying the element at index 2 of the `right_count` list. The state of the other variables remains the same. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 4, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[4]`, `right_count[2]` is incremented by 1.**
