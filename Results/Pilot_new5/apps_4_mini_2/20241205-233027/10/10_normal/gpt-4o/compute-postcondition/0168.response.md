Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `d` representing the number of sofas, and two positive integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the storehouse. It then reads the coordinates for each sofa and checks for each sofa to find if there exists a sofa that has a specific count of other sofas positioned to its left, right, top, and bottom as specified by `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. If such a sofa exists, the function returns its 1-based index; otherwise, it returns -1. **
