According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Since `j` starts at 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration, and we also need to ensure that `d` is greater than 1 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1**
