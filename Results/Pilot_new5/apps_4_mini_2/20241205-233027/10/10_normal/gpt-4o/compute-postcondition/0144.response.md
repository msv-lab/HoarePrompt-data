Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 4, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[4]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `left_count[2]`.***
