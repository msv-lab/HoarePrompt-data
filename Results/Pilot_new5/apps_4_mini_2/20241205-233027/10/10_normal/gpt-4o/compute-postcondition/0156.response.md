Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, and `target_sofa` is set to 1, resulting in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
