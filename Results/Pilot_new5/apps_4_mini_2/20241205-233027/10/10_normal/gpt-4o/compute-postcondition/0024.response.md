The code snippet assigns the elements of the list `sofas` at index `j` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not directly affected since this assignment is to new variables prefixed with `j`. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` were taken from the first element of `sofas`. 

Since the code snippet does not change any of the previously defined variables `d`, `i`, `sofas`, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain the same, the only new variables impacted are `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, which are assigned the corresponding values from the `sofas` list at index `j`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `sofas` is a list that has at least 1 element; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas` at index 0; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas` at index `j`.**
