The code appends a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the list `sofas`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are determined by input, but the initial conditions of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the current state of the program reflects the updated `sofas` list with the newly added tuple.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from input split into integers.**
