Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, and the current tuple `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`. Consequently, `top` has been increased by 1, while `left` and `right` remain unchanged.***
