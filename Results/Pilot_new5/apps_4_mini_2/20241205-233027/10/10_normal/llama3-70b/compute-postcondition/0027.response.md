The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it is assumed to exist. The states of the other variables, including `sofas` and `s`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list, and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list, `left` is increased by 1**.
