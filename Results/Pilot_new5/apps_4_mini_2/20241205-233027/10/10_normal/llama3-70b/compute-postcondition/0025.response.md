Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` with equal second elements, then `right` is increased by 1 and `top` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged while `top` is still increased by 1.***
