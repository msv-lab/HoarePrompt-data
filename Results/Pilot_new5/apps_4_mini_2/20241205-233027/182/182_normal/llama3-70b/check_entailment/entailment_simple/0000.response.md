To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze what the program is designed to do based on the input and the expected output.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The input is an integer `x` representing the angle of camera rotation, which can be between -10^18 and 10^18 degrees.
2. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to rotate the image such that its deviation from vertical is minimized.
3. Positive `x` indicates clockwise rotation, while negative `x` indicates counter-clockwise rotation.
4. The image should be adjusted based on the effective angle after considering rotations (modular arithmetic).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `x` from standard input.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - It calculates `x = x % 360`, which reduces `x` to a value between -359 and 359, representing the effective angle of rotation.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `x` is `0`, it prints `0` (no rotation needed).
   - If `x` is not `0`, it calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed using the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The critical part of the program is the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This formula is intended to compute how many 90-degree clockwise rotations are needed to adjust the image based on the input angle `x`.

- For positive angles:
  - If `x` is between `1` and `90`, one 90-degree turn will reduce deviation to `90 - x`.
  - If `x` is between `91` and `180`, two 90-degree turns will reduce it to `180 - x`.
  - If `x` is between `181` and `270`, three 90-degree turns will reduce it to `x - 270`.
  - If `x` is between `271` and `359`, four 90-degree turns bring it back to 0 degrees.

- For negative angles:
  - If `x` is between `-1` and `-90`, three 90-degree clockwise turns will achieve a minimal deviation.
  - If `x` is between `-91` and `-180`, two 90-degree turns will reduce deviation.
  - If `x` is between `-181` and `-270`, one 90-degree turn will be necessary.
  - If `x` is between `-271` and `-359`, no turns are needed as the image is already approximately vertical.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required for any given angle `x`, adhering to the logic specified in the problem description. All edge cases (including large positive and negative values) are handled by the modulo operation and the conditional checks.

Correctness: **True**
