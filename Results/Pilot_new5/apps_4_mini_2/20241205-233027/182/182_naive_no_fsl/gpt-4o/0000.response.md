Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible edge cases outlined in the problem description. For example:

1. The logic to determine the number of turns performed in the expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not account for cases where the angle is negative (i.e., counter-clockwise rotation). The angle normalization step only applies modulo 360, but it should also consider the effective angle when determining how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed.

2. Consider the input `-270`. The normalized angle would be `-270 % 360`, which results in `90`. The program would calculate `turns` as `(360 - 90) // 90 % 4`, which gives `3`. However, the correct number of 90-degree clockwise turns for `-270` degrees should be `1` (since a single 90-degree clockwise turn from `90` degrees will give `0` degrees, which is the desired state).

3. The program does not account for angles like `0`, where no turns are necessary. In that case, the output should be `0`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle situations involving negative angles, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect based on the problem requirements and the examples provided.
