The function accepts an integer `n` (which is read from input) and a string `s` (also read from input) consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in any contiguous sequence of lowercase letters in `s` and prints this count. The function does not explicitly return a value, and it does not handle cases where `s` may be empty or contain no lowercase letters, potentially resulting in a maximum count of 0 being printed.
