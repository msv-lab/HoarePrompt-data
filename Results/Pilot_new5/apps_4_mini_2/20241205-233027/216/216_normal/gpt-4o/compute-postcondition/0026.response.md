The variable `current_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `current_count` is unknown from the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. However, we know that `current_count` has been increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` now includes `char`, and `current_count` is increased by 1.**
