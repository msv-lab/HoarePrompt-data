The value of `current_count` is explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.
