The code `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `current_count` remain unchanged after this line. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` contains `char` if it is a lowercase letter, otherwise `current_set` remains empty; `current_count` is 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter and was not previously in `current_set`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_count` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_count` and `current_count`.**
