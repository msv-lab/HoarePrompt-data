The code snippet `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`. The initial state specifies that `current_set` contains `char` if it is a lowercase letter; if `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` remains empty. 

Since the code does not change `n`, `s`, or `current_count`, only `current_set` might change depending on whether `char` is a lowercase letter.

1. If `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` will now contain `char` (assuming it was not already there).
2. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` remains unchanged.

Given that `current_set` contains `char` if it is a lowercase letter from the beginning, and since the code adds `char` to the set, the relevant part of the output state will reflect that `current_set` now contains `char` (again).

Assuming `char` was a lowercase letter initially:
- `current_set` will affirmatively include `char`.

Since `current_count` does not change, the final output state will reflect these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` contains `char`; `current_count` remains unchanged.**
