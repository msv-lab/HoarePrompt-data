Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` will contain `char` and `current_count` will increase by 1. If `char` is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, then both `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of the previous `max_count` and the current evaluation of `current_count`.***
