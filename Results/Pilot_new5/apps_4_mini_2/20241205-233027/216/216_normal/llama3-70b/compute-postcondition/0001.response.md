`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `s` will now hold a new string input provided by the user. The previous constraints on `n` remain valid, but the value of `s` will change based on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is now a string input provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string input from the user.**
