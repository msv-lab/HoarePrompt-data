The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the signature provided. However, based on the constraints described, we can infer the expected inputs: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200, and `s` is a string that consists of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length equal to `n`. 

Since there is no specific output described in the provided information, we can't ascertain the exact behavior of the function. Therefore, we'll focus solely on the parameters and their characteristics.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` (length of `s` is equal to `n` and consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters).**
