Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where multiple segments of lowercase letters are present between uppercase letters correctly. Specifically, if there are consecutive segments of lowercase letters separated by uppercase letters, the program incorrectly counts the maximum distinct lowercase letters across the segments instead of treating them separately. 

For example, consider the input:

```
10
aAbBcCdD
```

In this case, the expected output should be 3 (for the lowercase letters 'a', 'b', 'c'), but the program will mistakenly consider 'a', 'b', 'c' as one segment and only count 1 for the first segment before the first uppercase letter, leading to a final output of 1 instead of 3. 

Thus, as it fails to account for such scenarios, the program is incorrect.
