Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are lists of two strings each containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x1` remains unchanged with an initial value of 1 and `x2` is updated to the value of `i`. If `puzzle2[i]` is not 'X', then `x1` is still 1 and `x2` remains unchanged.***
