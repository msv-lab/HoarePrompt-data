The function accepts two lists, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing two strings with exactly one of each tile ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty cell ('X'). It swaps the positions of 'X' between the two puzzles and returns True if the sorted contents of both puzzles are equal after the swap, meaning they contain the same tiles in any order. If the conditions of the inputs are not met (e.g., if the lists do not contain the expected characters or if they contain duplicates), the function's behavior is undefined but it assumes the inputs are valid as described.
