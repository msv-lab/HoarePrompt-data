The function accepts a string `start` of length 4 representing a 2x2 sliding puzzle configuration and returns a set of all unique states reachable from the initial configuration by valid moves of the 'X' tile. The function explores all possible configurations by swapping 'X' with its adjacent tiles, considering the boundaries of the 2x2 grid. It does not check for a specific goal state or validate if the input string is of the correct length or format.
