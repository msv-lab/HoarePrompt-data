The `new_state` variable is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which means it becomes a list representation of the string stored in `current`. Since `current` is 'ABCX', `new_state` will be `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']**.
