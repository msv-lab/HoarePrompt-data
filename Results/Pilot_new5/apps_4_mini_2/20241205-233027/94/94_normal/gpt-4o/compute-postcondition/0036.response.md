The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The value of `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`, but we don't know the previous value of `queue`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and is included in `visited`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `new_state_str` is a string derived from `new_state` after swapping values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `visited` includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
