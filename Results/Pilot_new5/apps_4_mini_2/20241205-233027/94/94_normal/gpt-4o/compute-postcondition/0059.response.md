The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which converts the string or sequence `current` into a list of its characters or elements. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so we simply capture this new assignment.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, `visited` may include `new_state_str` if valid, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 2, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 5, `new_state` is a list containing the elements of `current`.**
