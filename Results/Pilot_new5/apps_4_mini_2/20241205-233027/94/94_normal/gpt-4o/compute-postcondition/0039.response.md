Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains all possible valid states derived from swapping the empty slot with its adjacent slots, `visited` is a set containing `start` and all unique valid states that have been generated from those swaps, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last state processed in the loop, `empty_pos` is the position of the empty slot, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are the row and column indices of the empty slot respectively. If no swaps are possible (e.g., if the board is already in a configuration where the empty slot cannot be moved), then `queue` remains empty and `visited` is unchanged.**
