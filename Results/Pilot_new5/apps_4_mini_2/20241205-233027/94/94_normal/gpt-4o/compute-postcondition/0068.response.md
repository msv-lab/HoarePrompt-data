The value of `new_row` is calculated as `1 + dr` and the value of `new_col` is calculated as `1 + dc`. As these variables haven't been provided, we will keep them as expressions involving `dr` and `dc`. 

The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Therefore, `new_pos` can be expressed as `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`.

Thus, the output state will reflect this computation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we report them as they were.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is `1 + dr`, `new_col` is `1 + dc`, `new_pos` is `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`**.
