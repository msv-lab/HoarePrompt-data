Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC', and `new_state_str` is 'ABXC'. If `new_row` is within the range [0, 2) and `new_col` is within the range [0, 2), then if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, both `queue` and `visited` are updated to include 'ABXC', and `new_pos` is updated based on the calculations performed.***
