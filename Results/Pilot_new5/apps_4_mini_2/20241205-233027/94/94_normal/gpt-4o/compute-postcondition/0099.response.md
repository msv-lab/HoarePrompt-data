The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. Since `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', it will now be included in the `visited` set. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC', `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', `queue` is updated with `new_state_str`, `visited` now includes 'ABXC', `new_pos` is updated based on the calculations done.**
