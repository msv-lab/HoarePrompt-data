According to the code, the loop iterates over the `directions` list, which contains 4 tuples representing possible movements. In this case, `directions` remains as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], so the loop will execute once for each direction.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the first direction. To prepare for the next iteration, we need to update the current direction being processed. The `dr` and `dc` values will be taken from the next tuple in the `directions` list.

Since the loop's iteration will increment through the `directions`, after processing the first direction `(-1, 0)`, the next direction will be `(1, 0)`, and then the loop will proceed to `(0, -1)` and `(0, 1)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the `dr` and `dc` accordingly. 

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not previously in `visited`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str` if the new position is valid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), `directions` remain as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2, dr is 1, dc is 0`**
