The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the variable `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. Since `new_state_str` is not already included in `visited`, it will be added successfully. The other variables remain unchanged, so we retain their previous states.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` can be either ['X', 'B', 'C', 'A'], ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], or ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is either 'XBCA', 'AXCB', 'ABXC', or 'ABCX', and `new_state_str` is not in `visited` before the operation.**
