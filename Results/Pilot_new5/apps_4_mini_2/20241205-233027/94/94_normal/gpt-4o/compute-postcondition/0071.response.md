The `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which means it is created by joining the elements of `new_state`. The previous states of other variables remain unaffected. However, the exact value of `new_state` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `new_state_str` without that information. 

We know that:
- `start` is 'ABCX'
- `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values
- `visited` includes `new_state_str`
- `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
- `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`
- `empty_pos` is 3
- `empty_row` is 1
- `empty_col` is 1
- `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`
- `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`
- `new_pos` is equal to `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`

However, since `new_state` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will indicate that `new_state_str` is derived from it without specifying its value. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the result of `''.join(new_state)`.**
