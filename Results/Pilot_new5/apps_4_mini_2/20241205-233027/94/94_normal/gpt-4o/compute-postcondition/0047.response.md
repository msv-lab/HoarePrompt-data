The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`, where `new_row` is calculated as `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` as `empty_col + dc`. Given that `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` will represent the new position of 'X' after the move defined by the directions. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
