The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. However, since the specific values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_pos`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
