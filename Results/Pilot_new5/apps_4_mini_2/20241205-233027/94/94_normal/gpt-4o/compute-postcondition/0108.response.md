The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates all the elements in the list `new_state` into a single string. However, the variable `new_state` itself is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output will reflect that `new_state_str` is updated but does not provide specific information about its value.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` includes 'ABXC', `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col'**.
