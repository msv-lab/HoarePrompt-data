Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is now `empty_row + dr`, `empty_col` is now `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `queue` or `visited`.***
