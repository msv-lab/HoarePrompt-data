Let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged; `dr` and `dc` are the next values in `directions`.

The code snippet:
```
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
Here, `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned values based on the sum of the current `empty_row` and `dr`, and the current `empty_col` and `dc`, respectively. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are unknown but are necessary to calculate `new_row` and `new_col`. 

Since `dr` and `dc` are not defined in the initial state, we assume they have specific values as per the context of the directions. The other variables `start`, `queue`, and `visited` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated but does not provide specific values without knowing `empty_row` and `empty_col`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
