The variable `new_state_str` is appended to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but `queue` now contains the new state represented by `new_state_str`. The output state reflects the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.**
