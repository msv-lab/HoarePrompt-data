The code snippet `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the `current` variable. The `current` variable holds a specific state that was removed from `queue`, but may contain any values. Other variables remain unaffected in this step, but we establish that `new_state` is now a list version of `current`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.**
