According to the code, the while loop can execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` contains `start`, which is a string of length 4. Since `start` is not empty, `queue` is not empty either. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without the need for adjustments.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
