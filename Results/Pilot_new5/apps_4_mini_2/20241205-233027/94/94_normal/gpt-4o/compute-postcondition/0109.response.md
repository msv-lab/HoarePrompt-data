After the execution of the code `visited.add(new_state_str)`, the following occurs:

1. The set `visited` previously included the string 'ABXC'.
2. The new string `new_state_str` is formed by joining the elements of `new_state` after swapping elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.
3. The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. This means that `visited` will now contain 'ABXC' as well as the new string `new_state_str`.

The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` includes 'ABXC' and `new_state_str', `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` includes 'ABXC' and `new_state_str', `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
