The code assigns `new_state` to a list created from `current`. Since `current` is equal to `start`, which is the string 'ABCX', `new_state` will be a list of the characters in that string. The other variables remain unchanged as the list assignment does not alter their values.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'].**
