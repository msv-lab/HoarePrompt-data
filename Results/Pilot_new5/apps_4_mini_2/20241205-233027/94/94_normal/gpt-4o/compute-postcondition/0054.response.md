Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not previously in `visited`, and `visited` now includes `new_state_str`. `directions` remains as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; and `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.***
