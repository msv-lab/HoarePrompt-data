The variable `empty_pos` is assigned the value of the index of 'X' in the `current` string. The previous state indicates that `current` was the last state removed from `queue`, but its specific value is not given. However, the impact is that `empty_pos` will correspond to the position of 'X' within whatever state `current` holds. The status of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State must reflect this.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include all valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last state removed from `queue`, and `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
