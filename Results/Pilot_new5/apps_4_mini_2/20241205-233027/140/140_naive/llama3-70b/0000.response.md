To verify the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to evaluate how well the program adheres to the requirement of determining if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `n` (number of vertices) and `m` (number of edges) correctly.
   - It constructs a directed graph using an adjacency list.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program employs a depth-first search (DFS) approach via the `func_1` function to detect cycles in the graph. It uses a `visited` list and a `rec_stack` (recursion stack) to track visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack, respectively.

3. **Logic Flow**:
   - If a cycle is detected, the program prints "NO".
   - If no cycles are detected, it prints "YES".

### Identifying Potential Cases

For this program to be correct, it should return "YES" if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the current implementation checks for cycles but does not actually consider the situation where removal of an edge can lead to acyclicity.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a scenario:

**Input:**
```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
1 4
4 2
```

**Analysis of the Graph**:
- This graph has a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.
- However, if we remove the edge 3 -> 1, the graph becomes acyclic.

The current program will detect the cycle and output "NO", even though it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing an edge. 

### Conclusion

The program fails to consider that by removing an edge (in this case, 3 -> 1), the graph can be made acyclic. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
