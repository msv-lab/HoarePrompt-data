The code assigns the value `False` to `rec_stack[node]`, indicating that for the specific `node`, there is no cycle detected on any path leading to it. The states of the other variables (`node`, `graph`, `visited`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `node` is an integer, `graph` has been fully traversed, `visited` indicates all nodes reachable from the original `node`, and `rec_stack[node]` is set to False.

Output State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` has been fully traversed, `visited` indicates all nodes reachable from the original `node`, `rec_stack[node]` is False**.
