Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer with at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `func_1` returns True, it indicates a successful condition for the unvisited neighbor. Otherwise, if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating a valid recursion path.***
