You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each vertex u has a list of vertices v that it points to, and `graph` contains all edges from the list `edges`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating a valid condition in the directed graph represented by 'graph' without cycles.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each vertex u has a list of vertices v that it points to, and `graph` contains all edges from the list `edges`. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing all edges, `graph` contains all edges from `edges`, and the graph contains at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' indicating a specific condition about the graph with at least one cycle
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (the number of vertices, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and `m` (the number of directed edges, where 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), along with a list of tuples `edges` representing directed edges between the vertices. It checks for cycles in the directed graph formed by these edges. If the graph does not contain any cycles, it returns 'YES'. If at least one cycle is detected, it attempts to remove edges one by one and checks again for cycles. If it finds that removing an edge results in a cycle-free graph, it returns 'YES'. If all edges are checked and cycles still exist, it ultimately returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input lists may be empty or when the edges contain invalid vertices, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex. n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex; `u` is each vertex in `graph` during the iteration.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` after processing all nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating all nodes with zero in-degrees have been processed, and `count` is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph that had zero incoming edges initially, plus any additional nodes that had their in-degree reduced to zero during the loop execution. If `queue` was initially empty, then `in_degree[v]` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, and `count` is 0.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if the total number of nodes processed (count) is not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph (n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph, where keys are integers (vertices) and values are lists of integers (edges). It determines whether the graph contains a cycle by checking if the total number of processed nodes (count) equals the total number of vertices (n). It returns True if there is a cycle, indicated by `count` being not equal to `n`, and False if there is no cycle, meaning all nodes were processed successfully. The function is designed to handle graphs with 2 to 500 vertices.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
