The operation `node = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost item from `queue`. Given that `queue` must contain at least one neighbor with zero incoming edges, this operation will result in `node` being assigned one of those neighbors. The values of `in_degree[v]` and `count` are not directly affected by this operation, but the state of `queue` will change as one element is removed from it.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` no longer contains the previously leftmost neighbor, and `count` reflects the total number of nodes added to the queue; `node` is assigned the value of the removed neighbor from `queue`.**
