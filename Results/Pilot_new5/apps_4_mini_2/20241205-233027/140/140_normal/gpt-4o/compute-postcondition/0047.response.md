The value of `count` is incremented by 1, reflecting that another node has been added to the queue. The states of the other variables (`in_degree[v]`, `queue`, and `node`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` no longer contains the previously leftmost neighbor, `node` is assigned the value of the removed neighbor from `queue`, and `count` has increased by 1.
