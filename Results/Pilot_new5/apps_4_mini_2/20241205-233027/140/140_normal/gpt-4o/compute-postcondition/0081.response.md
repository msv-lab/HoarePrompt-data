The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and the values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the total number of vertices in the graph, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. After executing the function body, it returns `True` if the total number of nodes processed (count) is not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph (n). Therefore, the functionality of the function `has_cycle` is to accept a directed graph represented as a dictionary and determine whether there is a cycle in the graph based on the number of processed nodes compared to the total nodes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph (a dictionary representing a directed graph) and returns True if there is a cycle in the graph, indicated by the total number of processed nodes not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph.**
