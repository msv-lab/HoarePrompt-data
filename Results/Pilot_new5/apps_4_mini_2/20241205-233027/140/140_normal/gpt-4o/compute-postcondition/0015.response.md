The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. The current state of `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 2. After the increment, the new value of `in_degree[v]` will be the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 3. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State reflects the updated value of `in_degree[v]`.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 vertices, `u` is the second vertex in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is now equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 3, `v` must be the fourth vertex in `graph[u]`.**
