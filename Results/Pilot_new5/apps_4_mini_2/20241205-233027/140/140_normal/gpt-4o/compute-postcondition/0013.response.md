The statement `in_degree[v] += 1` increases the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 1. Since we are incrementing `in_degree[v]`, this means that the count of incoming edges to vertex `v` will effectively increase by 1, leading to `in_degree[v]` being one more than its previous value.

The conditions surrounding `graph`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `in_degree[v]`, while the other variables retain their original definitions.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 vertices, `u` is the second vertex in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is now equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus 2, `v` must be the third vertex in `graph[u]`.**
