The variable `queue` is assigned a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where the value corresponding to each node is equal to 0. This means `queue` will hold all vertices from the `graph` that have no incoming edges.

The state of `in_degree` remains unchanged, as this code only reads from it. The variable `graph` also remains unchanged. The variable `queue` now holds a collection of the vertices with zero incoming edges. Therefore, the Output State reflects this new assignment.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary; `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`.**
