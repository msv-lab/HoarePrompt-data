Output State: **`in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` after all neighbors of `node` have been processed, `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` that had their `in_degree` reduced to 0, `count` is the total number of neighbors processed from `node`, and `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that had neighbors before the loop started.**
