According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `graph`. If the graph has at least 2 vertices, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph` must have at least 1 vertex, and `u` is the first vertex in the graph. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the graph needs to have at least 2 vertices, and `u` should be updated to be the next vertex in the graph.

State: **`graph` must have at least 2 vertices, `u` is the second vertex in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v`, where `v` is each vertex in `graph[u]`.**
