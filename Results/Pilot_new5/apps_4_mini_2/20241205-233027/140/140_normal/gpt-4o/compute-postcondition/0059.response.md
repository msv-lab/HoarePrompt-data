The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the value of `neighbor` to the `queue`. The initial state mentions that `queue` contains at least one neighbor, so after the code execution, `queue` will contain that neighbor plus the value of `neighbor`. The other variables remain unchanged, but `queue` will now have an additional element.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is greater than or equal to 0 and now equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`; `count` is increased by 1; `queue` contains at least two neighbors; `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that still has remaining neighbors.**
