The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The value of `v` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `v` represents a vertex in the `graph`. Since the `graph` must have at least 3 vertices and `u` is the third vertex, it suggests that `v` is also a vertex in the `graph`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 3 vertices, `u` is the third vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must not be empty, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
