Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is less than or equal to `b`. It returns the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is expected to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and there is no error handling for cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return 0, which would lead to a division error. Thus, the function may face issues if `func_1` does not behave as expected.**
