Output State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` must be non-zero, `a` is now `b_initial`, `b` is now `b_initial % b_initial`, which is not allowed since `b_initial` must not allow `a_initial % b_initial` to equal 0. Therefore, `b` must be equal to `a_initial % b_initial`, which is `a_initial - k*b_initial` for some integer k.**
