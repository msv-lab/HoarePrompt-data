You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Annotated Functions:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues iterating until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`, the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative, as the GCD is only defined for positive integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≤ b and GCD(a, b) is a divisor of LCM(a, b).
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b), where GCD(a, b) is a divisor of LCM(a, b) and both a and b are positive integers such that a ≤ b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is less than or equal to `b`. It returns the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is expected to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and there is no error handling for cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return 0, which would lead to a division error. Thus, the function may face issues if `func_1` does not behave as expected.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
