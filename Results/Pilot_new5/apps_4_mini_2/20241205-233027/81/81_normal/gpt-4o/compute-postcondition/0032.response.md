Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9); `x` and `y` are integers such that (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9); `z` is defined as `y // x` with `z >= 1` and `z >= (i + 1)`. If `z % i == 0`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `a` is calculated as `(i + 1) * x`, and `b` as `(y // x) // (i + 1) * x`. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` hold, along with `(math.gcd(a, b) == x)` and `(a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y)`, then `count` is increased by 1 if `a` equals `b`, or increased by 2 if they are not equal. If the condition does not hold, no changes occur to `count`.***
