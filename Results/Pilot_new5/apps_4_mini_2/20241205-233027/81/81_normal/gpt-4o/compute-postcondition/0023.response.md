Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9); `x` and `y` are integers such that (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9); `z` is defined as `y // x`, where `z >= 1` and `z >= (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1, and `a` is equal to `i * x`; `b` is equal to `z // i * x`. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` hold true, along with `(math.gcd(a, b) == x)` and `(a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y)`, and if `a` equals `b`, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` is increased by 2. If the conditions are not satisfied, the function does not modify `count`.***
