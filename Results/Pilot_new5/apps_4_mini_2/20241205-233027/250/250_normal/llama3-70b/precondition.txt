n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 1000000000), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), where each integer in a represents the distance of the marks from the origin, and all distances in a are non-negative and do not exceed l.
