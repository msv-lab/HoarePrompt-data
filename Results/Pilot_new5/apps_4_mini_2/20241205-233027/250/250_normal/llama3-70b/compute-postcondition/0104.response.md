Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains all values that were added during loop execution based on the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`, where `i` is the last element in `marks`. If no values were added, it remains unchanged.**
