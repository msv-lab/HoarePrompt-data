Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `marks`. If `i + j` (where `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`) is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has one more element, which is `i + j`.***
