The value of `i` is assigned as the second element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. The new value being appended to `additional_marks` is the sum of `i` and `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now has an additional element which is `i + j`.**
