The variables `need_x` and `need_y` are assigned the values `False`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a set of integers based on user input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a set of integers based on user input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False.**
