The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given that `i` is the first element in `marks`, and it is stated that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, along with the condition that `i + j` is not already an element of `marks`, the new value will be added to `additional_marks`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` now includes `i + j`, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not an element of `marks`.**
