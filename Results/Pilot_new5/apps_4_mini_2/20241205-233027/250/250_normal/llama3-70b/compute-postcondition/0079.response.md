Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` includes values that are of the form `i + j` for every `j` in `additional_marks`, provided that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`. If no iterations occur, `additional_marks` remains unchanged.**
