The variable `marks` is assigned a set of integers created by mapping the input values (which are space-separated integers) to integers. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as the input affects only the `marks` variable. The specific values of `marks` will depend on the user input but are constrained by the input conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a set of integers based on user input.**
