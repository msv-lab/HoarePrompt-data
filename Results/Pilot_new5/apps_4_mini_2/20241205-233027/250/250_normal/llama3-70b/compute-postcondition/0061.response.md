Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (with `i < j`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False; `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (with `i < j`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False; `additional_marks` is an empty list.**
