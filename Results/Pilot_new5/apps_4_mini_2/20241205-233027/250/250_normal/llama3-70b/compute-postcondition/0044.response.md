The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment, and the previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x` (i.e., `marks[2] - marks[2] == x`); `need_x` is True.
