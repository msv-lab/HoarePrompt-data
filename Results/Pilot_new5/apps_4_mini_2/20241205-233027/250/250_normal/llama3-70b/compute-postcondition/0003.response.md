According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range of 2 to 100,000, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. There are no other variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` must also be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be 0 before the first iteration.

The values of `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not affect the execution of the loop itself; they may be relevant within the loop body but are not critical for the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0**
