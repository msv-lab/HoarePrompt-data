To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state and the loop structure.

1. The loop is iterating over `additional_marks`, which means that `additional_marks` must be a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute at least once.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to the first element in `marks`. This suggests that `marks` is also an iterable that has at least one element, which aligns with the requirement that `marks` must be a non-empty iterable.
3. The variable `n` being a positive integer does not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, it gives context that `n` is related to the number of elements in `marks`.

Given this understanding, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` is non-empty.

Thus, the adjusted state should include the condition for `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must be a non-empty iterable**
