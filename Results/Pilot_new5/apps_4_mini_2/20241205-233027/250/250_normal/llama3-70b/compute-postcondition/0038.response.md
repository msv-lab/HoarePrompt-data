The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` is True, and `need_x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` is True, `need_x` remains unchanged**.
