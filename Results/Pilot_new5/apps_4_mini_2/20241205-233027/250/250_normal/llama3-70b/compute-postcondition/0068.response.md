According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. For the loop to execute, `marks` must be a non-empty iterable. The state before the loop indicates that `n` is a positive integer, but it does not provide direct information about `marks`. Therefore, we can infer the following:

1. We need `marks` to be defined as a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute. 
2. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `marks` during the loop execution.

Since the state of `additional_marks` and `need_y` remains unchanged if `need_y` is True and is updated if `need_y` is False, it does not contribute to the conditions for loop execution directly.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `marks` is a non-empty iterable.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` must be a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`**
