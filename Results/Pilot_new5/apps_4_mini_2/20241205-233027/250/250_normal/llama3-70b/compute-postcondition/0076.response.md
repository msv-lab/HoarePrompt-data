According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element after `j`. 

Since `marks` is a non-empty iterable, we need to ensure that `i + j` (which is currently being used) is considered for the next iteration. The variable `j` must be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be the next element in the `additional_marks` iterable.
- If there is no next element in `additional_marks`, the loop cannot execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` (if available)**
