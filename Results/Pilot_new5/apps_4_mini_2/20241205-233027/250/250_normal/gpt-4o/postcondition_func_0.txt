The function accepts four integers `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers representing positions on a ruler. It checks if there are marks on the ruler such that one mark is `x` or `y` units away from another. If both conditions are met, it outputs `0`. If not, it attempts to find new marks generated based on the existing marks and outputs `1` along with one of the new marks if any are found. If no new marks can be created, it returns the missing values of `x` and `y` that were not found, indicating their absence. The function does not handle cases where the input values fall outside the specified constraints.
