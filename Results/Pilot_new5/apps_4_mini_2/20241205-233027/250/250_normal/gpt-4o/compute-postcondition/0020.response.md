The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the most internal loop or if statement that was being executed. As a result, the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, `y_found`, and `x_found` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the list; `y_found` remains unchanged, `x_found` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
