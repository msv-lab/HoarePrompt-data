The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
