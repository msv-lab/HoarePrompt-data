The code initializes `new_marks` as an empty set. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the other information remains unchanged while `new_marks` is introduced as a new variable with its own state.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is `False`; `y_found` is `False`; `new_marks` is an empty set.**
