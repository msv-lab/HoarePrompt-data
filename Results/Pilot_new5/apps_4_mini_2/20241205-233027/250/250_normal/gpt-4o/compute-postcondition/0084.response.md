Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers containing all the elements originally present in `marks`; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `new_marks` is an empty set; `y_found` is False; `x_found` remains False; and `result` is updated to a list containing the current value of `x`. Additionally, `y_found` is still False.***
