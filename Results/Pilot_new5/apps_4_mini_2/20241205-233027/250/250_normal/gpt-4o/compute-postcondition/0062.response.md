Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`. If `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + y`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y`. If neither condition is met, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
