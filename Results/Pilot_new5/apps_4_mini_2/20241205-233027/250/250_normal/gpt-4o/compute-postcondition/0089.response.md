Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers containing all the elements originally present in `marks`; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`. If `new_marks` is not empty, it is updated to exclude the last element which has been popped, while `x_found` may be True or False depending on whether any valid conditions for `x` were met. If `new_marks` is empty, then both `y_found` and `x_found` are False, and `result` is a list of length 1 containing the current value of `x`, appended with `y` as False, and printed as ' '.join(map(str, result)).***
