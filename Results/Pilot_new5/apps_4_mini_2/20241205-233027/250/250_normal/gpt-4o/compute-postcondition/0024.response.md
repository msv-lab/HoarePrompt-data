Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers containing at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; if `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `y_found` remains unchanged and `x_found` is set to True; otherwise, `y_found` and `x_found` remain unchanged as there is no else part.***
