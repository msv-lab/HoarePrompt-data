The `y_found` variable is assigned the value `True`, which means it has changed from its previous state. The other variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, and `marks_set` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y_found` is now `True`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers containing at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is True; `x_found` remains unchanged.**
