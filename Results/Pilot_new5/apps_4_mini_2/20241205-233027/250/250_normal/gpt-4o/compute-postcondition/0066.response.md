The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the result of `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is the next element in the list `marks` and `x` is a positive integer, the resultant value added to `new_marks` is `mark - x`, which will still be unique as sets only store distinct values.

The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and `y_found` remain unchanged, while `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - x`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` is a positive integer; `y` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `new_marks` now contains `mark - x`.**
