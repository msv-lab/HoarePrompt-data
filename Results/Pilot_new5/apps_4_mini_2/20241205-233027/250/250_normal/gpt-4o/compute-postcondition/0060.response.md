The statement `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the `new_marks` set. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since this line does not alter the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `y_found`, `mark`, or `new_marks`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `marks_set` is a set containing unique values from `marks`, `y_found` is False, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, and `new_marks` now additionally contains `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `new_marks` includes `mark - y`.**
