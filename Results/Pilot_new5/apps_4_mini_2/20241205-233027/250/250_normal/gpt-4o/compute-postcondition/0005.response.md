According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. For the loop to run, `marks` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `x_found` and `y_found` must reflect whether `x` and `y` have been found among the marks.

For the loop to execute, we can state the following conditions:
1. `marks` must not be empty, which implies it should contain at least one integer.
2. The variables `x_found` and `y_found` should be initialized as `False`, indicating that neither value has been found at the start of the loop.

Thus, the adjustments needed are as follows:
- Ensure that `marks` has at least 1 element.
- Keep `x_found` as `False`.
- Keep `y_found` as `False`.

State: **`n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`.**
