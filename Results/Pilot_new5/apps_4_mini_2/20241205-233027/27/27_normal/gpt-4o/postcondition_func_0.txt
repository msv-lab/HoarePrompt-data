The function accepts three positive real numbers x, y, and z, each ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive, with one digit after the decimal point. It calculates various exponential expressions involving these numbers and identifies the expression with the maximum value. The function then prints the corresponding expression that yields the maximum value, but does not return any value.
