The variable `a7` is assigned the value of `(y ** x) ** z`. The expression involves raising `y` to the power of `x`, and then raising that result to the power of `z`. This results in `a7` being equal to `y` raised to the power of `x * z`. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, and `a6` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y * z`; `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z * y`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `(y ** x) ** z` or `y` raised to the power of `x * z`.**
