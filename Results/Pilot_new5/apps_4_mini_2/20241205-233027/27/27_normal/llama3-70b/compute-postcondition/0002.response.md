`a2` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`. The previous variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `a2` becomes `x ** (z ** y)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are still within the range of 0.1 to 200.0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`.**
