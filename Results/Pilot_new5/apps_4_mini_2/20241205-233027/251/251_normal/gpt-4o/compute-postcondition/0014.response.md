Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n`; `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume sum of cakes whose volumes are less than `volumes[i]`, with `dp[0]` equal to `volumes[0]` and all other `dp[k]` for k > 0 reflecting the computed values based on the comparisons made during the loop. If no volumes are less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains equal to its initial value of 0.**
