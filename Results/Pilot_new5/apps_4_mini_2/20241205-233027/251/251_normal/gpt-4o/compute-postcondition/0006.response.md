The function `func_2` accepts user input representing the number of cakes and their dimensions. It reads a positive integer `n`, which indicates the number of cakes, and expects a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function then calls another function `func_1`, passing `n` and the list of cakes as arguments. Finally, it prints the result of `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places.

However, the function does not handle potential input errors, such as non-integer values or insufficient input data based on the expected format. It also does not check if the number of tuples matches `n`, which could lead to issues if the input is not as expected. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. It calls another function with these parameters and prints the result formatted to six decimal places, but does not handle potential input errors or validate input format. **
