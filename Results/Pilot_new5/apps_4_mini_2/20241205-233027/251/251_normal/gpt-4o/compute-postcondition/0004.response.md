The `print` statement outputs the value of `result`, formatted to six decimal places. The value of `result` is derived from the function `func_1(n, cakes)` based on the initial state. The other variables such as `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the state of the program after executing the print statement will indicate that `result` has been output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing the tuples of (int(data[1]), int(data[2])), (int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[2*n-1]), int(data[2*n])), and `result` is output formatted to six decimal places.**
