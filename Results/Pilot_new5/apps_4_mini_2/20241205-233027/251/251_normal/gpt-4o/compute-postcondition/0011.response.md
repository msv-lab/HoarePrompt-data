According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 2. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which means `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `i` is at least 2 and must be greater than 2; `j` is 2; `cakes` is a list of tuples (r_i, h_i) with (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000); `volumes` is a list of computed volumes.**
