The values of `r` and `h` are assigned based on the user input, which will be read as two integers separated by a space. The values of `r` and `h` are not predetermined, so they will be integers based on the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer**.
