Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of the previous `dp[i]` and the sum of the previous `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, the values of `dp` remain unchanged.***
