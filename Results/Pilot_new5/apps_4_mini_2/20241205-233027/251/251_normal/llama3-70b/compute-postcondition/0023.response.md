Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and either `dp[0] + cakes[i][0]` (if `j` equals 0) or `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` (if `j` is any other valid index).***
