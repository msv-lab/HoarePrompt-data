Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + cakes[i][0]` while `dp[j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
