Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `dp[i]` is the maximum sum of the volumes of cakes that can be stacked, where each cake `i` meets the conditions of being smaller in both radius and height compared to previously considered cakes; `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and `dp[1]` through `dp[n-1]` are computed based on the conditions applied to all previous cakes in the `cakes` list.**
