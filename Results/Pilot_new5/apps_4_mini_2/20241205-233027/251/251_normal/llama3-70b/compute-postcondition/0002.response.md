According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`, which is specified to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Since `n` meets this condition before the loop starts, the loop will indeed execute. 

However, during each iteration of the loop, the loop variable (which is indicated by `_`, meaning it is not used inside the loop) is not required to be stored or adjusted. The variables `r_i` and `h_i` are provided but are not referenced within the loop structure, and the list `cakes` starts as empty but might be filled within the loop.

For the loop to execute correctly:
1. `n` is confirmed to be a positive integer.
2. The loop will iterate exactly `n` times.
3. The state `cakes`, which is an empty list, does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Thus, at the beginning of the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The loop variable `_` can take values from 0 to n-1 across its iterations but does not need to be specified before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000**
