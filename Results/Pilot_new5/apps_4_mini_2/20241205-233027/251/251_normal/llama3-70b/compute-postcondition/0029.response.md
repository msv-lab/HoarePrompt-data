The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged, but we can explicitly state that `dp` now includes the value from the `cakes` array. The conditions regarding `n`, `i`, and `j` indicate that `i` is at least 3, so `dp[i]` will be updated to the corresponding value from `cakes`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is at least `i - 1`, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain as `cakes[0][0]` and `cakes[1][0]` respectively, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements.**
