Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
