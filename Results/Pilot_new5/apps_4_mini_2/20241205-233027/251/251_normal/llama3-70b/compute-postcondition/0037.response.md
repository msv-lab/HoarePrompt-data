According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` with respect to `i`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `i`, which also implies that `i` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`**
