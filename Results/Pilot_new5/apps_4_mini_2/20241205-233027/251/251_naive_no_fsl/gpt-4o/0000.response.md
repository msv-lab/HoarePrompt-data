To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function, which calculates the maximum volume of the stacked cakes according to the defined rules.

1. **Volume Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the volume of each cake using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum possible volume at each cake. It initializes a `dp` array where:
   - `dp[i]` represents the maximum volume that can be obtained with the i-th cake placed as the top cake.

3. **Placement Logic**: The program checks for each cake `i` if it can be placed on top of cake `j` (where \( j < i \)) based on the condition that the volume of cake `i` must be strictly greater than that of cake `j`. If this condition is satisfied, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value obtained by placing cake `i` on top of cake `j`.

4. **Final Result**: The program finally returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which gives the maximum volume of the stacked cakes.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that cakes can be stacked in any order based on their index and the condition regarding volumes, but it does not sort the cakes by their volumes. This could lead to incorrect placement logic if the cakes are not processed in the order of their volumes.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:
```
Input:
3
3 1
2 2
1 3
```
- The volumes calculated would be:
  - Cake 1: \( V_1 = \pi \cdot 3^2 \cdot 1 = 9\pi \)
  - Cake 2: \( V_2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2 = 8\pi \)
  - Cake 3: \( V_3 = \pi \cdot 1^2 \cdot 3 = 3\pi \)

- The expected stacking would allow for:
  - \( V_2 \) (8π) on \( V_1 \) (9π), but not the other way around.
  
- When processed in order, the program would result in only adding smaller volumes without considering potential stacking.

This logic is flawed as it could miss out on a larger total volume by not sorting or correctly evaluating cakes before stacking based on the condition provided.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the counterexample provided where the program could yield incorrect stacking due to the order of processing, the final determination is that the program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
