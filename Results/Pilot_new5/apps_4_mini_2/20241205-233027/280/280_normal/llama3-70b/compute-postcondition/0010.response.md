To determine the output state after executing the code, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100)
- `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100)
- `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100)
- `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10)
- `max_speed` is calculated as `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`
- `min_speed` is calculated as `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`
- `max_length` is calculated as `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`
- `min_length` is calculated as `min(v_1, v_2) * t`
- `i` is calculated as `t - 1`

Now we have the code snippet:
```
min_length += min_speed
```

The impact of this code:
- `min_length` is updated by adding the value of `min_speed` to it.

Since `min_length` was initially calculated as `min(v_1, v_2) * t`, after adding `min_speed`, the new value of `min_length` becomes:
- `min_length = min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed`

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `min_length` while maintaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed, `i` is `t - 1**.
