In the given scenario, the value of `min_length` is computed as `min_speed * t`. The variables `min_speed` and `t` have not been altered, but the value of `min_length` will now be updated based on the previous values of `min_speed` and `t`. 

Since `min_speed` is defined as `min(v_1, v_2)` and `t` is an input value, we can express `min_length` in terms of the input values:

- `min_speed` = `min(v_1, v_2)`
- `min_length` = `min_speed * t` = `min(v_1, v_2) * t`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`), `min_speed` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`), `max_length` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`, `min_length` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`.**
