To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state:

1. `max_speed` is initially defined as `max(v_1, v_2)`.
2. `min_speed` is defined as `min(v_1, v_2)`.
3. The code updates `max_speed` to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.

Let's denote:
- `max_speed = max(v_1, v_2)`
- `min_speed = min(v_1, v_2)`

After executing the code:
- The new value of `max_speed` becomes `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`.

The value of `min_speed` remains unchanged, and since `d` is a non-negative integer within the specified range, the calculations will ensure that `max_speed` will not drop below `min_speed`.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- `max_speed` will be updated to `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`.
- `min_speed` remains as `min(v_1, v_2)`.

The initial conditions of the inputs and other variables remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is updated to `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_speed` is `min(v_1, v_2)`, `max_length` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`, `min_length` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
