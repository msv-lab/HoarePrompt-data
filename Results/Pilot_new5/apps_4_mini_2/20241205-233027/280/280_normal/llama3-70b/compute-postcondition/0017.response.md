Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (3 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` remains unchanged, `max_length` is now `max(v_1, v_2) * t + 2 * max_speed`, `min_length` is now updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`**
