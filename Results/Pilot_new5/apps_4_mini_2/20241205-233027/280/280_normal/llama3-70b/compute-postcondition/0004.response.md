The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed` multiplied by `t`. Given the initial state, `max_speed` is defined as `max(v_1, v_2)`. Therefore, `max_length` becomes `max(v_1, v_2) * t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`), `min_speed` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`), `max_length` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`.**
