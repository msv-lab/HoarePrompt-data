The variable `min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` remain unchanged, but we now know that `min_speed` is either equal to `v_1` or `v_2`, depending on which one is smaller.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`), `min_speed` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`)**.
