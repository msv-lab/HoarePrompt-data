To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the operation `min_length += min_speed`. 

Initially, we know that:
- `max_speed` is calculated as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
- `max_length` is calculated as `max(v_1, v_2) * t + 2 * max_speed`.
- `min_length` is calculated as `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed`.
- `i` is initialized to `t - 2`.

After running the code `min_length += min_speed`, the value of `min_length` is incremented by the current value of `min_speed`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the relevant updates are:
- `min_length` becomes `min_length + min_speed`.

The output state summarizes the unchanged and updated variable values:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is now `max(v_1, v_2) * t + 2 * max_speed`, `min_length` is now updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`.**
