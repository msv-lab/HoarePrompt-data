Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, here is the evaluation:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100)
   - `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100)
   - `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100)
   - `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10)
   - `max_speed` is calculated as `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`
   - `min_speed` is calculated as `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`
   - `max_length` is calculated as `max(v_1, v_2) * t`
   - `min_length` is calculated as `min(v_1, v_2) * t`
   - `i` is `t - 1`

2. **Code Snippet Impact**:
   - The line `max_length += max_speed` modifies the `max_length` variable by adding the value of `max_speed` to it. 

3. **Updated Values**:
   - The value of `max_length` will change from its initial calculation `max(v_1, v_2) * t` to `max_length + max_speed`.
   - Other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `max_speed`, `min_length`, `i`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100)
   - `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100)
   - `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100)
   - `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10)
   - `max_speed` is `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`
   - `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`
   - `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`
   - `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t`
   - `i` is `t - 1`

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**.
