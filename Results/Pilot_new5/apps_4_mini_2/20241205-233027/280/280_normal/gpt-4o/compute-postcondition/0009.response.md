According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. The loop will continue to execute until `i` is no longer less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` must be at least 3, meaning for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, `i` will become 3. Since `t` is at least 3, there are no additional conditions on `t` to consider for the next iteration.

State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1`, speeds[1] is equal to min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), speeds[2] is updated to min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d), speeds[-1] is equal to `v2`, and `i` is 3**.
