The variables `v1` and `v2` are assigned values from the input, which are integers that fall within the range of 1 to 100. The function `map(int, input().split())` takes input and splits it into two parts, converting them to integers. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code.

Since `v1` and `v2` can now take specific values from the input, we denote them as the integers obtained from the input split.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100); `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.**
