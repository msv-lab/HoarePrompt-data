The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `input()` (which accepts a space-separated string of integers) to `int`. The previous value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. After executing the code, `a` will be a list containing `n` integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on input.**
