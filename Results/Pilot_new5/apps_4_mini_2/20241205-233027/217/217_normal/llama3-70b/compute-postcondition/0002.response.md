The list `a` is sorted in reverse order (from highest to lowest). The value of `n` remains the same, and `a` now contains its elements in descending order. The specific values of `a` are not provided, but it is still valid that `a` is a list of `n` integers based on input. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order.**
