The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and since `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, the index `a[i]` is out of bounds (as valid indices for `a` are from `0` to `n-1`). As a result, an IndexError will be raised when attempting to access `a[i]`. Therefore, the values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and the execution cannot proceed to update `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, and an IndexError occurs due to accessing out of bounds of the list `a`.**
