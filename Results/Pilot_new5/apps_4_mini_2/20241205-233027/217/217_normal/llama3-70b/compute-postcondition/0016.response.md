The variable `i` is assigned the value `n + 1`, which is one greater than the maximum index of the list `a` (which ranges from 0 to n-1). Therefore, `a[i]` refers to an index that is out of bounds for the list `a`. As a result, attempting to execute `c += a[i]` will cause an error due to an index error. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and an index error occurs when trying to access `a[i]`.**
