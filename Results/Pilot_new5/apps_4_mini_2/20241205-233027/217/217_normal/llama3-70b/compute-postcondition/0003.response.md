The values of `b` and `c` are both initialized to 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected. The output state retains the conditions for `n` and `a` while updating `b` and `c` to 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `b` is 0; `c` is 0.**
