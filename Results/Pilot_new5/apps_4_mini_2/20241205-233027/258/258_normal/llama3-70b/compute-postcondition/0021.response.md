To determine the output state after executing the code, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999 
- `times` is a sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`

In the code, we have:
```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Step by step:
- The variable `times` is assigned the output of the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `x` and `y`, both of which are -999. Therefore, `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` is called.
- The previous state of `times` (which was a sorted version of a list) is replaced by the new output of `func_2`.

Since `func_2` returns a list that is then sorted, the exact contents of `times` depend on the implementation of `func_2`. However, the important point is that now `times` will hold the result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`.

The variable `ans` remains unchanged in this execution step, as there has been no assignment or modification to it in the provided code snippet.

Thus, the output state updates the value of `times` based on the output of `func_2`, keeping `x`, `y`, and `ans` as they were previously.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is the output of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**.
