To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the code itself.

Initial State: `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is updated by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`

Since we do not have information regarding the `func_2` implementation, we will assume that the function modifies `times` in some way based on `x` and `y`. However, we do know that `times` is now a list, which we must consider when sorting.

The code `times.sort()` will sort the list `times` in ascending order. The specific values of `times` after executing the sorting operation depend on the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, but the action of sorting itself does not change the values of `x` or `y`.

Since `times` is updated (the exact contents are unknown) but will now be in sorted order, we keep that in mind.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted**
