According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The variable `y` will take on each integer value in that range as the loop executes. 

The state before the loop shows the values of `x`, `y`, `times`, and `ans`. The key points to note are:
- `x` is -998, which doesn't directly affect the loop's execution.
- `y` is 1000, which is outside the loop's range of -1000 to 1000.
- `times` is a sorted version of a non-empty list, and its values will not affect the loop's execution but could be relevant in the loop body.
- `ans` is updated before the loop starts, but its prior value does not affect whether the loop can execute either.

For the loop to execute as intended, the variable `y` should start at the first value in the range (which is -1000). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- Change `y` to -1000 to reflect the first value in the intended loop range.
- Clarify that `times` must remain as a sorted non-empty list, but its content isn't relevant to the loop's execution.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is a sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
