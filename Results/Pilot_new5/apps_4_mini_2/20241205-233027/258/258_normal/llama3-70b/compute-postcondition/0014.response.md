To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we must recognize how the loop iterates over the range of `y` from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The variable `x` remains constant at -1000 throughout the iterations. The variable `K` must remain a positive integer with the constraint that it is always less than or equal to `N`. The variable `ans` is initially set to `float('inf')` and is updated during the iterations based on the minimum value from the sorted `times` list.

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the final values of the relevant variables are as follows:

- `y` takes on the last value in the range, which is 1000.
- `ans` contains the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values obtained from each iteration of the loop.
- The `times` list will have been generated and sorted during each iteration, but we do not have the final values of `times` after the last iteration.

Since the loop iterates for each integer value of `y` from -1000 to 1000, a total of 2001 iterations occur. The output state after all iterations can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list generated from the results of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`.**
