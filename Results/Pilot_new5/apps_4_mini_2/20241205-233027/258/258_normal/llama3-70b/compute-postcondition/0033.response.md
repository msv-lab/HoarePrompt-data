To analyze the impact of the code, we need to determine what `times[K - 1]` is based on the initial state and how it affects `ans`. 

Given:
- The initial state specifies that `x` is -998, `y` is -1000.
- `times` is the sorted version of the list returned by `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`. We don't have the exact values from `func_2`, but we know `times` is sorted.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

The operation `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` means that `ans` will take the smaller value between its previous value and the value at index `K - 1` of the sorted list `times`.

Since no values for `ans` or `K` are provided in the initial state, we can only state that `ans` will be updated. The outcome of this operation directly depends on the values which are not specified. However, we are assured that `times` remains sorted after this operation.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state by noting that:
- The previous value of `ans` is either maintained or updated to a new minimum based on `times[K - 1]`.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is sorted.**
