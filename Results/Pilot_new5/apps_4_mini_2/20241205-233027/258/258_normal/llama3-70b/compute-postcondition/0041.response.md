To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`

The code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` evaluates the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the value located at index `K - 1` of the `times` list. 

Since `times` is derived from a function `func_2` that takes four parameters (all being -998), the specific values of `times` or `K` are not explicitly provided in the problem statement. However, we can deduce the following:

1. The `ans` variable is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the value at `times[K - 1]`.
2. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Given that we do not have specific values for `ans`, `times`, or `K`, we can express the relationships:

- The value of `ans` becomes the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` and retains the values of `x`, `y`, and the definition of `times`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998), ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
