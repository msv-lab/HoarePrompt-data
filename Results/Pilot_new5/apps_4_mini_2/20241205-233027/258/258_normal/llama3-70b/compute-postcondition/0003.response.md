The code assigns the result of calling `func_2` with parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y` to the variable `times`. The values of `x` and `y` are both -1000, and thus the parameters passed to `func_2` are -1000 for both `x` and `y`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this operation. 

We cannot determine the exact value of `times` without knowing the implementation of `func_2`. However, the other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is float('inf'), and `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is float('inf'), `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**.
