The function `func_2()` is called with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state where `x` is -999 and `y` is -998, the function will execute and return a new value for `times`. The value of `ans` will then be updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. However, without knowing the details of the function `func_2()` or the value of `K`, we cannot determine exact values for `times` or `ans`. Only `times` will be updated based on the function output, but we also cannot infer the previous value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes to `times` based on the function execution and maintain the previous information about `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is updated by func_2(x, y, x, y)**.
