The variable `times` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_2` with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`, which are both -1000 and -999. The value of `times` will depend on the implementation of the function `func_2`, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values in `times`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.**
