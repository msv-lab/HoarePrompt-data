The value of `d` is updated by dividing it by the product of `c1` and `c2`. The previous value of `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`. Therefore, after the operation, the new value of `d` becomes `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, and `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`**.
