The variable `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, where `input()` accepts an input string and `split()` divides that string into a list based on whitespace. The list `data` will contain the pieces of information entered as strings. The other variables `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unaffected in this execution.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `K` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be ready (1 <= K <= N), `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
