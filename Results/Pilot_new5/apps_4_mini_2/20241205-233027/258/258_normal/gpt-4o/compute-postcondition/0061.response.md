The value of `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Since `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can express `d2` in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. Thus, `d2` can be calculated as:

\[
d2 = \left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2
\]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`.**
