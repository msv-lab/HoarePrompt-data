The expression `d /= c1 * c2` modifies the value of `d`. The current value of `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`. After executing the code, `d` will be updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, which simplifies to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`**.
