The variable `dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the relationship between `x1` and `x2` determines the value of `dx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2.**
