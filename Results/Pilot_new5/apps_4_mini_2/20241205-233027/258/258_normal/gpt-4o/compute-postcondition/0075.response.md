The values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are being swapped. After the assignment, `x1` takes the value of `x2`, `y1` takes the value of `y2`, and `c1` takes the value of `c2`. Conversely, `x2` takes the value of `x1`, `y2` takes the value of `y1`, and `c2` takes the value of `c1`. The values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `count`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Since `c1 * T < c2 * T`, we know that originally `c1 < c2`. After the swap:
- `x1` becomes `x2`
- `y1` becomes `y2`
- `c1` becomes `c2`
- `x2` becomes `x1`
- `y2` becomes `y1`
- `c2` becomes `c1`

All other variables retain their previous values. The output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, `x1` is assigned the value of `x2`, `y1` is assigned the value of `y2`, `c1` is assigned the value of `c2`, `x2` is assigned the value of `x1`, `y2` is assigned the value of `y1`, `c2` is assigned the value of `c1`**.
