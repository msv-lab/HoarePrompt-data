The value of `d2` is calculated as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Given that `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can express `d2` as follows:

- `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- This simplifies to `d2 = ((x1 - x2) ** 2) / 4 + ((y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4`
- Therefore, `d2` becomes `( (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2 ) / 4`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we will document the new value of `d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4`, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is less than `K`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
