The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, `dx` is now equal to the result of the expression involving `x1` and `x2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
