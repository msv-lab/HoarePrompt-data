The statement `continue` is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, there are no specific variables being changed or assigned new values, and the values of the relevant variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are simply bypassing the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **No variables are changed; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
