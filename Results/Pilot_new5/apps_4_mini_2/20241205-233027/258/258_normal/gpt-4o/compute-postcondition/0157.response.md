The `continue` statement does not alter any variables or their values; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration, if there is one. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)`. The current value of `d * d2` is greater than `d2`.**
