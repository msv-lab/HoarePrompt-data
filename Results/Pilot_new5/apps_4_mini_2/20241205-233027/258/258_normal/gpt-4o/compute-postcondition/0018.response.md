The value of `x` is now assigned the integer value obtained from `data[index]`. Since `index` is 9, `x` will now hold the value of `int(data[9])`. The previous value of `x`, which was equal to `data[5]`, is overwritten. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is 9, `x` is equal to `int(data[9])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])**.
