Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `i` is increased by 1, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
