The code snippet prints the value of `result` formatted to six decimal places. The value of `result` was previously assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and it remains unchanged by the print statement. 

Therefore, the Output State retains all the previous information about the variables, but just confirms that `result` is printed in a specific format.

Output State: **`N` is the original integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[2 + 3 * (N - 1)], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 1], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 2])`, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(N, K, meats)` and printed as `result` formatted to six decimal places.**
