The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The other variables remain unaffected and their previous states continue to hold. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is `12`, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(int(data[9]), int(data[10]), int(data[11]))`, `index` is 12, `x` is equal to `int(data[9])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[10])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[11])`.**
