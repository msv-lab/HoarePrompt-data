The code `continue` indicates that the execution of the current loop iteration is skipped, and the next iteration begins. The states of all the variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that we are moving to the next iteration of a loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
