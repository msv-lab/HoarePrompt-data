The code `continue` does not modify any variable values; it simply causes the current iteration of the loop to terminate and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, no changes to the variable states occur. The initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.**
