The operation `d /= c1 * c2` updates the value of `d` by dividing it by the product of `c1` and `c2`. The initial state indicates that `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we know `d` is affected by this operation. As a result, the new value of `d` will be `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`. The variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `count`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`.**
