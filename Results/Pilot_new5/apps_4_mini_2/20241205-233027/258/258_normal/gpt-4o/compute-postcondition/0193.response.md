Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T` and `d2` is a real number. If `d < 0`, then if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `x1` becomes the previous value of `x2`, `y1` becomes the previous value of `y2`, `c1` becomes the previous value of `c2`, `x2` becomes the previous value of `x1`, `y2` becomes the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` becomes the previous value of `c1`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `d` is not less than 0, no changes are made to the variables.***
