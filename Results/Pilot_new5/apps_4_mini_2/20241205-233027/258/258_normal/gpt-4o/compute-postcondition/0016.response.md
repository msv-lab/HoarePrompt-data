The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 5, so the new value of `index` becomes 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than 1, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is now 8, `x` is equal to `data[5]`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `data[5]`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.**
