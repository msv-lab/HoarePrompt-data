The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are unknown in terms of specific values, but the calculation remains valid based on the initial state. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
