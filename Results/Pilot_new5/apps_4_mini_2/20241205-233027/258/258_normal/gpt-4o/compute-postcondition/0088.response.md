The code `continue` is used within loops to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no specification of the current values or context of a loop, we cannot change any variable values directly. The states of all the other variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)`; the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
