The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables in this case. It simply causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration, assuming we are within a loop context. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
