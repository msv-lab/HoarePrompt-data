The code `continue` is a control statement that causes the loop to skip the rest of its body for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement. 

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d2` is a real number, `count` is a value less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `j`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` becomes the previous value of `x2`, `y1` becomes the previous value of `y2`, `c1` becomes the previous value of `c2`, `x2` becomes the previous value of `x1`, `y2` becomes the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` becomes the previous value of `c1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
