The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The initial state indicates that `index` is 9, so `c` will be updated to `int(data[11])`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is 9, `x` is equal to `int(data[9])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[10])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[11])`.**
