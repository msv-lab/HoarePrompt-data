The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and continue with the next iteration. Since the initial state does not provide specific details about the loop context (such as the values of `i` or if there are any modifications to `meats`, `K`, `T`, or `N` during the iteration), we cannot determine any specific changes to the variables.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we note that the execution will skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2, d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
