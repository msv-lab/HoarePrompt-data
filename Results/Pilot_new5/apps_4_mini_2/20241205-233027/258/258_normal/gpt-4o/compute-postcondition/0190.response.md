Postcondition: ***`d` and `d2` are real numbers, `count` is a value less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `j`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` becomes the previous value of `x2`, `y1` becomes the previous value of `y2`, `c1` becomes the previous value of `c2`, `x2` becomes the previous value of `x1`, `y2` becomes the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` becomes the previous value of `c1`.***
