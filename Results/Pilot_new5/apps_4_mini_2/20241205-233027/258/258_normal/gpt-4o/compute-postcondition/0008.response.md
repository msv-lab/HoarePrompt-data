`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `index` is 2, thus this translates to `int(data[4])`. The value of `K` remains unchanged as well as the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**
