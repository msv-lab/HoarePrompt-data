The value of `d` is updated by dividing it by the product of `c1` and `c2`. The initial state indicates that `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, but we do not have specific values for `c1` and `c2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, and `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`**
