The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `index` is 2. The value of `data[2]` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be converted to an integer for `x`. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
