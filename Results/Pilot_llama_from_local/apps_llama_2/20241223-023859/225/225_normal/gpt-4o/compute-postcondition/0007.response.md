Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, if the character at index `i` (which is 0) of string `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is 0, otherwise, the state of `prev_pos` and other variables remains as in the precondition.***
