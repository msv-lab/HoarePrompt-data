To calculate the result, we need to first understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` updates the value of `max_jump` by comparing its current value with the difference between `i` and `prev_pos` and assigning the maximum of these two values back to `max_jump`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters,
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'},
- `max_jump` is 1,
- `i` is 1,

We notice that `prev_pos` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot directly calculate `i - prev_pos`. However, since the question asks us to consider the impact of the code on the program and `prev_pos` is not given, we will assume `prev_pos` could be any value that would make `i - prev_pos` either less than or equal to `max_jump` (1) or greater than `max_jump`.

If `prev_pos` is such that `i - prev_pos` is less than or equal to `max_jump` (1), then `max_jump` remains 1 because `max(1, i - prev_pos)` would be 1. 

If `prev_pos` is such that `i - prev_pos` is greater than `max_jump` (1), then `max_jump` becomes `i - prev_pos` because `max(1, i - prev_pos)` would be `i - prev_pos`.

Given `i` is 1, for `max_jump` to change, `prev_pos` must be less than 0 (since `i - prev_pos` needs to be greater than 1), but since `prev_pos` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value or the range it could be. Thus, `max_jump` could either remain 1 or become `i - prev_pos`, depending on the value of `prev_pos`.

However, since the task specifically asks for the output state based on the given code and initial conditions without providing `prev_pos`, we must focus on the variables that are defined and how they might change. 

Given `i` is 1 and assuming `prev_pos` could be any value that makes `i - prev_pos` relevant to the comparison, `max_jump` could be updated to be `max(1, 1 - prev_pos)`. Without knowing `prev_pos`, we cannot precisely calculate this but acknowledge that `max_jump` could change based on the value of `prev_pos`.

The other variables (`s` and `vowels`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, considering the lack of information about `prev_pos` and its impact on `max_jump`, the output state is:
- `s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters,
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'},
- `i` is 1,
- `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos`, depending on the value of `prev_pos`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos`.**
