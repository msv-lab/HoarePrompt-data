To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`.

The code snippet is `return max_jump`.

Here, `max_jump` is calculated based on the length of string `s` and the position of the last vowel found (`prev_pos`). Since `s` consists of capital English letters, and given that `vowels` includes all the capital vowels plus 'Y', the last vowel found (`prev_pos`) can be any of these characters. The maximum jump (`max_jump`) then depends on how far the end of the string is from the last vowel found.

Given that `max_jump` is determined by `len(s) - prev_pos`, and considering `prev_pos` can be the index of any vowel in `s`, `max_jump` essentially represents the maximum distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.

Since `s` is non-empty and consists of capital English letters, the `len(s)` will be a positive integer. The `prev_pos` will also be a non-negative integer because it represents an index in the string `s`.

Therefore, `max_jump` returned by the program will be the maximum distance from the last vowel found in `s` to the end of `s`, considering all possible positions of vowels in `s`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum distance from the last vowel to the end of string `s`, where `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters and the last vowel can be any of 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'.**
