To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`.
- `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`.

The given code is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
```
This line updates the value of `max_jump` by comparing its current value with the distance from the last vowel (`prev_pos`) to the end of the string (`len(s)`), and it keeps the maximum of these two values.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string (`len(s) - prev_pos`) is calculated and compared with the current `max_jump`. The maximum of these two values is then assigned to `max_jump`.

The states of `s` and `vowels` are not affected by the code. The `prev_pos` might seem relevant for understanding the context, but its value does not change in the given code snippet. 

Thus, after executing the code, the output state is as follows:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string (`len(s) - prev_pos`).
- `prev_pos` remains the index of the last vowel found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`**
