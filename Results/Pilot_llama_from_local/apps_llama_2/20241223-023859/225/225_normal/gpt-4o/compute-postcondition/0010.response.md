The code assigns the current value of `i` to `prev_pos`. The value of `i` is 1. 

So, `prev_pos` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Now, `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos`. Since both `i` and `prev_pos` are 1, `i - prev_pos` equals 0. Therefore, `max_jump` is either 1 or 0, but since `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos` and `i - prev_pos` is 0, `max_jump` can only be 1 because `max_jump` cannot be less than 1 as per the given initial condition that `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos` and we know `max_jump` is at least 1 from the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, `max_jump` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, `max_jump` is 1**
