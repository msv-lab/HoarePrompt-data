The value of `prev_pos` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with at least 3 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is at least 1, but if the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `max_jump` is 1.
