To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is 1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(s)):`. This means the loop will iterate over each index of the string `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `s` is a non-empty string and the loop iterates over its indices, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters (since indexing starts at 0, the second character is at index 1).

The state of `vowels` and `max_jump` does not change based on the loop statement itself, so these remain the same.

The state of `prev_pos` is dependent on whether the character at index `i` (which was 0) of string `s` is a vowel. However, for the next iteration, we are considering `i` to be 1, so `prev_pos`'s value would depend on the character at index 1 of `s` if we were determining its new value based on the loop's progress. But since we're only asked about adjusting states for the loop to execute one more time and not the outcome of the loop body, we focus on the conditions that allow the loop to proceed, which are `i` incrementing and the string having sufficient length.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` must have at least 2 characters.
- `i` should be 1.
- The other variables' states (`vowels`, `max_jump`, and the condition-dependent `prev_pos`) either remain as they were or are adjusted based on the loop body, which is not specified here.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 1**
