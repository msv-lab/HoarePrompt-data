Since `max_jump` is 1 and `prev_pos` is -1, and `i` is 0, the code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` will calculate `i - prev_pos` as 0 - (-1) = 1. Then it will compare this result with `max_jump` and assign the maximum of the two to `max_jump`. 

So, `max_jump` will be the maximum of 1 and 1, which is 1. 

Therefore, the value of `max_jump` remains 1.

The Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is a vowel.
