Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 3 characters consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not a vowel, then the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition, with `i` being 2 and `max_jump` being at least 1.***
