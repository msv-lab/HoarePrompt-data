Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string `s` of capital English letters and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The function considers the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y' and handles edge cases where the string contains no vowels or only one vowel. In the case where the input string is empty or contains no capital English letters, the function may not behave as expected. The function's output will be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the input string, providing a measure of the spacing between vowels in the given string.**
