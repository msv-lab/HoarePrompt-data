According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
