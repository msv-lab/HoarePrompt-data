You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----

Output

Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct. It calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels, by keeping track of the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic:

1. It initializes a set of vowels and sets `max_jump` to 1, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the first vowel.
2. It iterates through the string, and whenever it encounters a vowel, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel (`i - prev_pos`).
3. After the loop, it updates `max_jump` one last time to be the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string (`len(s) - prev_pos`).
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Strings with no vowels (not a problem, since the Grasshopper can simply jump over the entire string).
* Strings with a single vowel (the jump ability required is 1, which is handled correctly).
* Strings with multiple vowels (the program correctly calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels).
* Strings with vowels at the beginning and end (the program correctly handles these cases).

Overall, the program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` of capital English letters and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The function considers the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y' and handles edge cases where the string contains no vowels or only one vowel. In the case where the input string is empty or contains no capital English letters, the function may not behave as expected. The function's output will be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the input string, providing a measure of the spacing between vowels in the given string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
