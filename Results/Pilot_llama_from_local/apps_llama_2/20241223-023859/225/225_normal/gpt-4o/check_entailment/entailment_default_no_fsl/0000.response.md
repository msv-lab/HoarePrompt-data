Correctness: **True**

The code provided does what the problem description says, for every potential case. It correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required to reach the far end of the string by jumping only on vowels. The code handles edge cases where the string contains no vowels or only one vowel, and it also handles cases where the input string is empty (although the problem description guarantees that the input string is non-empty).

The code uses a variable `max_jump` to keep track of the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. It iterates over the string, updating `max_jump` whenever it encounters a vowel. The function `func_1` returns `max_jump` as the minimum jump ability required.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, providing a measure of the spacing between vowels in the given string. The examples provided also match the expected output of the code. For instance, the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT" requires a minimum jump ability of 4 to reach the far end of the string by jumping only on vowels, which is correctly output by the code. Similarly, the input "AAA" requires a minimum jump ability of 1, which is also correctly output by the code.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution to the problem.
