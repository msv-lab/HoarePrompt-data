Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program initializes a set of vowels `vowels` and a variable `max_jump` to 1, which will store the maximum jump ability required.
2. It then iterates through the input string `s` and checks if each character is a vowel. If it is, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current position `i` and the previous vowel position `prev_pos`.
3. After the loop, it updates `max_jump` one more time to account for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string by only jumping on vowels.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with no vowels (in which case `max_jump` will remain 1)
* Strings with only one vowel (in which case `max_jump` will be the distance from the start of the string to the end of the string)
* Strings with multiple vowels (in which case `max_jump` will be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels)

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
