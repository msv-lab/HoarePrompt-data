You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. It correctly identifies the vowels in the English alphabet.
2. It iterates through the input string, checking each character to see if it's a vowel.
3. If a vowel is found, it updates the `max_jump` variable to be the maximum of its current value and the distance between the current position and the previous vowel position (`prev_pos`).
4. After iterating through the entire string, it updates `max_jump` one last time to account for the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string.
5. Finally, it returns the minimum jump ability required, which is the maximum of the distances between consecutive vowels.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as:

* When the input string contains only vowels, the program returns 1, which is the minimum jump ability required.
* When the input string contains no vowels, the program returns the length of the string, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.
* When the input string contains a mix of vowels and consonants, the program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, and `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns the maximum distance from the last vowel to the end of string `s`, where `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters and the last vowel can be any of 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
