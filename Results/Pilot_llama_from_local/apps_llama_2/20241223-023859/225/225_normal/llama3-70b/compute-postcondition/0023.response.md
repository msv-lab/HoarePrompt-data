Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is at least 3. Otherwise, `max_jump` is at least `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which is either 1 (if `last_vowel` is 1) or 2 (if `last_vowel` is considered as 0 when the second character of `s` is not a vowel).**
