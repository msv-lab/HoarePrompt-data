The value of `last_vowel` is updated to `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is 0, and if `last_vowel` is not -1, then `max_jump` is updated based on the calculation but its new value depends on the specific value of `last_vowel`.**
