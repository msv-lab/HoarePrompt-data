To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1. Otherwise, `last_vowel` is -1 or considered as 0 when the condition for `last_vowel` being 1 is not met.
   - `max_jump` depends on `last_vowel`: if `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is at least 3; otherwise, `max_jump` is at least `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, yielding 1 if `last_vowel` is 1 or 2 if `last_vowel` is considered as 0.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Given `i` is 2, this means `last_vowel` will now be 2, regardless of its previous value or the condition related to the second character of `s` being a vowel.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
   - `vowels` remains 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` remains a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `last_vowel` is now 2, as assigned by the code.
   - Given `last_vowel` is now 2, the condition for `max_jump` would be `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1 = (2 - 2) // 2 + 1 = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1`. Thus, `max_jump` is at least 1.

**Output State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2, and `max_jump` is at least 1.**
