The code prints the value of `max_jump`. The value of `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` if `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `last_vowel` and `max_jump`, we can't provide the specific value that will be printed, but we know that the `print` statement does not change the values of the variables. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, if `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, and `max_jump` has been returned at the output.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, if `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, and the value of `max_jump` has been returned at the output.**
