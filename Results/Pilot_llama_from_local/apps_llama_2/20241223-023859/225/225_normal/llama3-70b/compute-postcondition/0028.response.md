The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Since `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, and `n - last_vowel` represents the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. 

Therefore, `max_jump` becomes the maximum of its previous value and half of the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string plus 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, 
`vowels` remains 'AEIOUY', 
`n` remains a positive integer not greater than 100 and equal to the length of `s`, 
`i` remains `n-1`, 
`last_vowel` remains the index of the last vowel in `s` or `-1` if no vowel is found, 
and the current value of `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or `-1` if no vowel is found, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, and `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.**
