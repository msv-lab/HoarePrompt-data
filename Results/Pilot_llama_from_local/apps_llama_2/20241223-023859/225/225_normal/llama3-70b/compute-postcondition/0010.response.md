To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_jump` is 0.
- `last_vowel` is not equal to -1.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `s[i]` is a vowel.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
```

This line of code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Since `i` is 0 and `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, the value of `(i - last_vowel)` will be negative (because `last_vowel` must be greater than `i` since `i` is 0 and `last_vowel` cannot be -1). However, since we're dividing by 2 and then adding 1, we need to consider the floor division `//` which rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Given that `last_vowel` cannot be less than 0 (since `i` is 0 and we are looking at a position before `i` for the last vowel), the smallest possible value for `last_vowel` in this context would be 1 if we consider `i` and `last_vowel` in a sequence. But since `i` is 0, and assuming `last_vowel` has to be a position that makes sense in the context of `s` and must have been a vowel before `i`, the calculation `(i - last_vowel)` will indeed yield a negative value which, when divided by 2 (integer division), will result in the floor of that negative value, and then adding 1 will either increase it by 1 or leave it at 0 if the division result is -1.

However, considering `max_jump` is initially 0, and given the scenario where `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` could potentially yield a negative value or 0 (if `last_vowel` is 1, for instance, because `(0 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 0`), the `max` function ensures that `max_jump` does not decrease below 0.

Given that we don't have an exact value for `last_vowel` but know it's not -1 and `i` is 0, and considering the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, if `last_vowel` is 1, this would evaluate to 0. If `last_vowel` is greater than 1, `(i - last_vowel)` becomes more negative, and after division by 2 and adding 1, could still result in a non-positive value. 

The key insight is that since `max_jump` starts at 0, and we're taking the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression, `max_jump` will either remain 0 or become a positive value if the calculation yields a positive result, which is unlikely given `i` is 0 and `last_vowel` is positive, suggesting a misunderstanding in the direct calculation approach without specific `last_vowel` values.

To correct the approach for calculating `max_jump`:
- Since `i` is 0, and assuming `last_vowel` is a position that precedes `i` (thus, must be negative or not applicable in the conventional sense since `i` starts at 0), if we were to consider a scenario where `last_vowel` is indeed negative (which seems to be a misunderstanding since `last_vowel` cannot be an index less than 0 in a conventional string indexing), the calculation would not apply as expected.

Given the constraints and the code, the value of `max_jump` is updated based on the difference between the current index `i` (which is 0) and `last_vowel`. However, considering the conventional interpretation where indices start at 0, and assuming `last_vowel` refers to the index of the last vowel encountered before the current index `i`, if `i` is 0, then `last_vowel` being not equal to -1 implies we are considering a scenario where `last_vowel` is actually referring to a position that makes sense in the context of having found a vowel before, which seems to be a misinterpretation since `i` starts at 0.

Given this, and acknowledging a potential misunderstanding in the calculation due to the nature of the indices and the given initial conditions:
- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` remains 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` remains a positive integer not greater than 100 and equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_jump` is updated, but given the initial conditions and the nature of the calculation, without a specific value for `last_vowel`, we acknowledge the update but cannot assign a specific new value without making assumptions beyond the given constraints.
- `last_vowel` is not equal to -1.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `s[i]` is a vowel.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `max_jump` is updated based on the calculation but its new value depends on the specific value of `last_vowel`, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is a vowel.**
