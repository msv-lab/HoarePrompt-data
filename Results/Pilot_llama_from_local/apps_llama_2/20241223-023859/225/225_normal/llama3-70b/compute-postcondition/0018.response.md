The code updates the value of `last_vowel` to `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1**
