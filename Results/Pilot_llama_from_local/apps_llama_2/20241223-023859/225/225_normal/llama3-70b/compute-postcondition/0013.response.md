Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 0 and `max_jump` is updated based on the calculation if `last_vowel` is not -1. If `s[i]` is not a vowel, then the state of the variables remains unchanged***
