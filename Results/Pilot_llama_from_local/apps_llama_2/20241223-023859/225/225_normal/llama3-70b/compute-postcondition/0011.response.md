Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is a vowel. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is 1. Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated based on the calculation but its new value depends on the specific value of `last_vowel`, and `last_vowel` is not equal to -1.***
