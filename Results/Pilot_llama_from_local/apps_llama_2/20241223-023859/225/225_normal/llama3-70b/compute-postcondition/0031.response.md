The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems there should be a parameter, let's denote it as `input_string`, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100. 

Since the output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the given parameter constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a maximum length of 100 characters.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string of capital English letters with a maximum length of 100 characters.**
