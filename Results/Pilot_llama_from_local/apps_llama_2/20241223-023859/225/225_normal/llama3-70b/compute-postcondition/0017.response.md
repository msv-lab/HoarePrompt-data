Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and 2. Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`**
