To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.

The given code is: `n = len(s)`.

This code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string and its length does not exceed 100, the value of `n` will be a positive integer not greater than 100.

The states of the other variables (`s` and `vowels`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, which is a positive integer not greater than 100.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`.**
