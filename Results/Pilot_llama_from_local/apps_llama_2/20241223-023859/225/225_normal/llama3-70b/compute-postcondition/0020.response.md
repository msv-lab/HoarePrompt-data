According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. The state of `s` remains the same, as it is not changed by the loop condition. The state of `vowels` also remains the same, as it is a constant string. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, `n` is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1**
