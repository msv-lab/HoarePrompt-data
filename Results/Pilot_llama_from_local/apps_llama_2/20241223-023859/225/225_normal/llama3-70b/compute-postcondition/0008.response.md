To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_jump` is 0.
- The current value of `last_vowel` is -1.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `s[i]` is a vowel.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
```
Given that `max_jump` is initially 0 and `i` is 0, `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `i + 1` (which is 1).

Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to 1 because 1 is greater than 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

So, the output state will include the updated value of `max_jump` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is a vowel.**
