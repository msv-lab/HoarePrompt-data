According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, we can confirm that the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, and `last_vowel` is -1. For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to 0.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0**
