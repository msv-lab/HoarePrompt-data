The given code is updating the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `s` is still a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is still 'AEIOUY', `n` is still a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, and `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
