To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code updates the `max_jump` variable by taking the maximum between its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, and `n` is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1.

Since `i` is 2 and it is given that if the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1, the value of `(i - last_vowel)` can be either 1 (if the second character is a vowel) or 2 (if the second character is not a vowel, in which case `last_vowel` would be 0 because there's no information provided for `last_vowel` when the character is not a vowel, but for the purpose of this calculation, we'll consider `last_vowel` to be 0 when the second character is not a vowel).

Therefore, `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` can be either `(2 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 1` (if `last_vowel` is 1) or `(2 - 0) // 2 + 1 = 2` (if `last_vowel` is 0).

The initial value of `max_jump` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value after the execution. However, we know that `max_jump` will be updated to be at least as large as `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which can be either 1 or 2 based on the value of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and equal to the length of `s` and greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the second character of `s` is a vowel then `last_vowel` is 1, and `max_jump` is at least `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which is either 1 (if `last_vowel` is 1) or 2 (if `last_vowel` is considered as 0 when the second character of `s` is not a vowel).**
