To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1.

The given code snippet is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know `i` is 2. The variable `max_jump` is not defined in the initial state, so its initial value is unknown. However, the operation `max(max_jump, i + 1)` implies that `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`, where `i + 1` equals 3.

Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. The `max` function compares this value with the current value of `max_jump` and assigns the larger value back to `max_jump`. If `max_jump` was initially undefined or less than 3, it will now be 3. If `max_jump` was already greater than or equal to 3, its value remains unchanged.

The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `i`) and their conditions (including the condition related to `last_vowel`) are not affected by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1.
- `max_jump` is at least 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the second character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is at least 3**
