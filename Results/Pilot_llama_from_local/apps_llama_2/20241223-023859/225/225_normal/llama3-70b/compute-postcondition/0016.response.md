To calculate the impact of the code on the program, we need to understand what the code is doing. The code is updating the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and a calculated value based on `i` and `last_vowel`. However, we don't have the initial value of `max_jump` or `last_vowel` in the initial state.

Given the initial state: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, `i` is 1, we can infer that:

- `s` is still a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is still 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is still a positive integer not greater than 100, equal to the length of `s`, and greater than 1.
- `i` is still 1.

The value of `max_jump` is updated based on the formula `max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, but without knowing the initial value of `max_jump` or `last_vowel`, we can only express `max_jump` as being updated to this formula. However, since `i` is 1, the expression `(i - last_vowel)` will depend entirely on the value of `last_vowel`.

Since `last_vowel` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate a specific value for `max_jump`. Thus, the output state regarding `max_jump` will reflect its dependency on `last_vowel` without a specific value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer not greater than 100 and is equal to the length of `s` and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`**
