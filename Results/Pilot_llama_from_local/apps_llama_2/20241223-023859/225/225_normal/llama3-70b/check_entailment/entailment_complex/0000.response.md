Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper. 

The issue lies in the way it calculates the `max_jump`. The program calculates `max_jump` as the maximum of the distance from the start of the string to the first vowel, the distance between consecutive vowels divided by 2 plus 1, and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string divided by 2 plus 1. 

However, this approach is incorrect. The minimum jump ability should be the maximum of the distance from the start to the first vowel, and the distance between consecutive vowels, because the Grasshopper can jump any distance from 1 to its jump ability in one jump. 

To correctly calculate the minimum jump ability, the program should find the maximum distance between consecutive vowels and the distance from the start to the first vowel, and then return this maximum distance. 

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly calculates the minimum jump ability:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel!= -1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    else:
        max_jump = n
    print(max_jump)
```

This revised program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability by finding the maximum distance between consecutive vowels and the distance from the start to the first vowel, and then returns this maximum distance.
