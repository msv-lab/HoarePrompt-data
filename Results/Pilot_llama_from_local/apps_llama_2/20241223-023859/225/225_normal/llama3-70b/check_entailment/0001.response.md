Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the `max_jump` when the last vowel is not at the end of the string. The current implementation only considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, divided by 2 and rounded up. However, this does not account for cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over a larger distance to reach the last vowel, and then another longer distance to reach the end of the string.

A counterexample can be constructed with a string that has a long sequence of consonants at the end, preceded by a long sequence of vowels. For example, if we input the string "AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBB", the program should output a larger number to account for the long jump needed to reach the end of the string. However, the current implementation would output a smaller number, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program needs to keep track of the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, and return the maximum of this distance and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
