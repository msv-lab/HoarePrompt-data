Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle the case when there are no vowels in the input string. In the problem description, it's mentioned that the jump ability is the maximum possible length of the Grasshopper's jump, and it should be able to reach the far end of the string. However, in the given code, if there are no vowels in the string, it will print the maximum of the distance from the start to the end of the string divided by 2 plus 1. This is not correct, because if there are no vowels, the Grasshopper should not be able to jump to any character, and hence it should print the length of the string as the minimum jump ability.

For example, if the input is "BCDFGH", the code will print 3, which is not correct. The correct output should be 6, because the Grasshopper needs to be able to jump over the entire string to reach the end. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
