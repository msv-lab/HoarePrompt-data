Correctness: **False**

The problem with the given program is that it does not consider the maximum jump ability correctly. The program currently calculates the maximum jump ability by dividing the distance between two consecutive vowels by 2 and adding 1. This approach does not ensure that the Grasshopper can jump to the far end of the string.

A case where the program does not work correctly is the string "AE". In this case, the program will output 2 because it calculates the distance between the first and second vowels as 1 and then divides it by 2 and adds 1. However, the correct output should be 1 because the Grasshopper needs a jump ability of at least 1 to jump from 'A' to 'E'.

To fix this, the program should calculate the maximum jump ability by considering the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels, and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string. The maximum jump ability should be the maximum of these distances. 

Here is the correct python code to solve this problem:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    jump = [float('inf')] * n
    jump[0] = 0 if s[0] in vowels else float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j] in vowels:
                    jump[i] = min(jump[i], jump[j] + max(i - j, 1))
                    
    ans = min(jump[n-1], float('inf'))
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            ans = min(ans, jump[i] + max(n-1-i, 1))
    print(ans)

func()
```
This code will output the minimum jump ability required to jump to the end of the string.
