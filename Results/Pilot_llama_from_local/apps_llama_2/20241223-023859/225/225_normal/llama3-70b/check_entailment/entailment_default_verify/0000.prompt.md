You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

Input

Output

Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The problem with the given program is that it does not consider the maximum jump ability correctly. The program currently calculates the maximum jump ability by dividing the distance between two consecutive vowels by 2 and adding 1. This approach does not ensure that the Grasshopper can jump to the far end of the string.

A case where the program does not work correctly is the string "AE". In this case, the program will output 2 because it calculates the distance between the first and second vowels as 1 and then divides it by 2 and adds 1. However, the correct output should be 1 because the Grasshopper needs a jump ability of at least 1 to jump from 'A' to 'E'.

To fix this, the program should calculate the maximum jump ability by considering the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels, and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string. The maximum jump ability should be the maximum of these distances. 

Here is the correct python code to solve this problem:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    jump = [float('inf')] * n
    jump[0] = 0 if s[0] in vowels else float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j] in vowels:
                    jump[i] = min(jump[i], jump[j] + max(i - j, 1))
                    
    ans = min(jump[n-1], float('inf'))
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            ans = min(ans, jump[i] + max(n-1-i, 1))
    print(ans)

func()
```
This code will output the minimum jump ability required to jump to the end of the string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string of capital English letters with a maximum length of 100 characters, calculates and prints the maximum possible jump between vowels in the string, where the jump is defined as the maximum of the distance from the start of the string to the first vowel, the distance between consecutive vowels divided by 2 plus 1, and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string divided by 2 plus 1. If no vowels are found in the string, the function prints the maximum of the distance from the start to the end of the string divided by 2 plus 1. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result. The input string remains unchanged after the function execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
