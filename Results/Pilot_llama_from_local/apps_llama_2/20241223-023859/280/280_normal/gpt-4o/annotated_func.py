#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed d, starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and lasting for t seconds.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and for `1 <= i < t-1`, `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total distance traveled by an object that accelerates from an initial speed `v_1` to a final speed `v_2` over a period of `t` seconds, with a maximum acceleration of `d` units per second. The function takes four parameters: two initial speeds `v_1` and `v_2`, time `t`, and acceleration `d`, all of which are input integers. The function returns a single value, the total distance traveled, calculated by summing up a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed `d`. The final state of the program includes the total distance traveled, which is printed to the console. The function does not explicitly check if a valid sequence of speeds exists, but instead constructs a sequence that meets the acceleration constraint and calculates the total distance based on that sequence. The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges (1-100 for `v_1` and `v_2`, 2-100 for `t`, and 0-10 for `d`), but does not perform any explicit error checking.
