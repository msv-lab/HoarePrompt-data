According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, and `speeds` is a list of `t` integers. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` is now 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged but must be consistent with the problem description.

State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and the rest (except the first and the last) are zeros, `i` is 1**
