The code `t, d = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, converts these parts into integers, and assigns them to `t` and `d`, respectively.

Given the initial state: 
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive)

The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are not affected by the code. The new values of `t` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
