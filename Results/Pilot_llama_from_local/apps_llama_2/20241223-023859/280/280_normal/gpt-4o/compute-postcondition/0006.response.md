To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `d` is an input integer
- `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and the rest (except the first and the last) are zeros
- `i` is 1

Given Code:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Since `i` is 1, `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[0]`, which is `v_1`. Therefore, the equation becomes:
```python
speeds[1] = min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 1 - 1) * d)
```
Simplifying, we get:
```python
speeds[1] = min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)
```

The value of `speeds[1]` is now the minimum between `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`. The states of the other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, and the rest (except the first, the last, and the second) are zeros, `i` is 1**
