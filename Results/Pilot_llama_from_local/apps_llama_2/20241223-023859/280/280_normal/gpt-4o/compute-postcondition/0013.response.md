Given the initial state: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers, and `total_distance` is the sum of the `speeds` list.

The code provided simply prints the `total_distance`. This operation does not modify any of the variables; it merely outputs the current value of `total_distance` to the console.

Therefore, after executing the code, the states of all variables remain unchanged, but we have an additional action of printing `total_distance`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers, `total_distance` is the sum of the `speeds` list, and `total_distance` has been printed.**
