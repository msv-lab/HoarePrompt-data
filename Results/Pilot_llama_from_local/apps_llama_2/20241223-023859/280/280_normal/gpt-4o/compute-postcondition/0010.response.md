To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code based on the initial state provided.

The initial state is:
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `t` is greater than 3,
- `d` is an input integer,
- `speeds` is a list where:
  - `speeds[0]` is `v_1`,
  - `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`,
  - `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`,
  - `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`,
  - the rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros,
- `i` is 3.

The code to be executed is:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Given `i` is 3, this means we're updating `speeds[3]`. 

The calculation for `speeds[3]` involves two parts:
1. `speeds[i - 1] + d`, which translates to `speeds[2] + d`. 
2. `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which translates to `v2 + (t - 3 - 1) * d = v2 + (t - 4) * d`.

So, `speeds[3]` is set to the minimum of `speeds[2] + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`.

The value of `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`.

Thus, after executing the code, the output state is:
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `t` is greater than 3,
- `d` is an input integer,
- `speeds` is a list where:
  - `speeds[0]` is `v_1`,
  - `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`,
  - `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`,
  - `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`,
  - `speeds[3]` is the minimum of `speeds[2] + d` and `v_2 + (t - 4) * d`,
  - the rest (except the first, the last, and the second, third, and fourth) are zeros,
- `i` is 3.
