The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to be the two integers input by the user. The states of the other variables are not affected. The new values of `v1` and `v2` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive) because the `input` function accepts integers and they are mapped to `v1` and `v2`, but the exact values are determined by the user's input. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive)**
