To calculate the output state, let's first understand the given initial state and the code snippet. 

The initial state defines:
- `v_1` as an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `v_2` as an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `t` as an input integer,
- `d` as an input integer,
- `speeds` as a list of `t` integers, where the first element `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, the last element `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and for any other position `i` (where `1 <= i < t-1`), the value `speeds[i]` is determined by the minimum of two expressions: `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.

The code snippet calculates `total_distance` as the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list.

Given the formula for `speeds[i]`, it indicates a progression from `v_1` to `v_2` over `t` steps, with each step increasing by `d` but capped at a value that would linearly decrease the difference between `v_2` and the current speed over the remaining steps. This ensures that `speeds[-1]` equals `v_2`.

The code:
```python
total_distance = sum(speeds)
```
This line calculates the total distance traveled by summing up all the speeds in the `speeds` list. The `total_distance` is essentially the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `v_1`, the last term is `v_2`, and the common difference between successive terms is constrained by `d` and the requirement to reach `v_2` in `t` steps.

To find the specific value of `total_distance`, we would need to calculate each element of `speeds` based on the given formula and sum them. However, without explicit values for `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, we can describe `total_distance` as the sum of the `speeds` list which is determined by the progression from `v_1` to `v_2` over `t` steps, constrained by `d`.

Therefore, the output state is characterized by the initial conditions plus the new variable `total_distance`, which is equal to the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers as defined, and `total_distance` is the sum of the `speeds` list.**
