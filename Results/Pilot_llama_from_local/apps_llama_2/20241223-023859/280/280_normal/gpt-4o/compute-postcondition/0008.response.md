To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `t` must be greater than 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `speeds` is a list where:
  - `speeds[0]` is `v_1`
  - `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`
  - `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`
  - `speeds[2]` is the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`
  - The rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros
- `i` is 2

Code:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Substituting `i = 2` into the code:
```python
speeds[2] = min(speeds[2 - 1] + d, v2 + (t - 2 - 1) * d)
```
This simplifies to:
```python
speeds[2] = min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)
```

Given that `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, and `speeds[2]` is initially the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`, this operation updates `speeds[2]` to be the minimum of `speeds[1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`. 

Since `speeds[1]` is already the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, adding `d` to `speeds[1]` gives us the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d + d = v_2 + (t - 1) * d`. 

However, `speeds[2]` is updated to be the minimum of this result and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`. Thus, `speeds[2]` will be the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d`, and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`.

The other variables and list elements not affected by this operation retain their initial values and descriptions.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`, the rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros, and `i` is 2**
