The code `speeds[-1] = v_2` changes the last element of the `speeds` list to `v_2`. Initially, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1` and the rest are zeros. After the code execution, `speeds[0]` remains `v_1`, and `speeds[-1]` becomes `v_2`, while the other elements (except the first and the last) remain zeros.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and the rest (except the first and the last) are zeros**
