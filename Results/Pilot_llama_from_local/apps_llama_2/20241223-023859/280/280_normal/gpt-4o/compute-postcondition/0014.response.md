The function `func` accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). The function returns a value indicating whether there exists a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed `d`, starting with `v_1`, ending with `v_2`, and lasting for `t` seconds. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, and returns a value indicating whether a sequence of speeds exists with an absolute difference not exceeding d, starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and lasting for t seconds.**
