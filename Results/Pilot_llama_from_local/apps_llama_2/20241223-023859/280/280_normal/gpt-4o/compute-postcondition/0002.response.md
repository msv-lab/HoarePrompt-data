The given code creates a list named `speeds` with `t` number of elements, all initialized to 0. The initial state provides that `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer.

The code does not modify `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, or `d`. It only introduces a new variable `speeds` which is a list of `t` zeros.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros**
