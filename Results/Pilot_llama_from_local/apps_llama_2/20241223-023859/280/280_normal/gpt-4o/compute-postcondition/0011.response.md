To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes some number of times.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(1, t):
    speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

From the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can see the following patterns:

- The value of `speeds[0]` is always `v_1`.
- The value of `speeds[-1]` is always `v_2`.
- For each iteration `i`, `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `t` is greater than 1.

Let's analyze what happens after all the iterations of the loop have finished:

- If `t` is 1, the loop will not execute. In this case, `speeds` will remain a list with one element, `v_1`, and the rest of the variables will retain their initial values.
- If `t` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `t-1` times. After each iteration, the corresponding element in the `speeds` list will be updated according to the loop code.

Given these observations, we can infer the following about the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished:

- `v_1` remains the same as its initial value, an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `v_2` remains the same as its initial value, an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `t` is the same as its initial value, an input integer.
- `d` is the same as its initial value, an input integer.
- `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and the rest of the elements are calculated based on the loop code.

Considering the loop code, `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. This suggests that each element in the `speeds` list (except the first and the last) is calculated to be the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` and the final speed `v_2` plus the remaining distance `(t - i - 1) * d`.

Therefore, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and for `1 <= i < t-1`, `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.**
