The value of `speeds[0]` is updated to `v_1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, and `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where the first element is `v_1` and the rest are zeros.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1` and the rest are zeros**
