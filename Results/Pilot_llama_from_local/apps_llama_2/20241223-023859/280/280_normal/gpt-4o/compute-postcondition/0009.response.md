According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `t` must be greater than 3.

Additionally, we need to consider the states of `speeds` and other variables. Since `i` is now 3, `speeds[3]` should be the minimum of `v_1 + 3 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 4) * d`. However, the problem statement only asks for the adjustment of states at the start of the next iteration, not the calculation of new values.

State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 3, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 1) * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`, the rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros, and `i` is 3**
