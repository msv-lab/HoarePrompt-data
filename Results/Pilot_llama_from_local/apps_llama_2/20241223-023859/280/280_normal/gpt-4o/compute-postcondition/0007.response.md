According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

The list `speeds` has `speeds[0]` as `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` as `v_2`, and `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`. For `i` equal to 2, `speeds[2]` should be the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d` (since the index is now 2 and `t` is at least 3 for the loop to execute), and the rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros.

State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, `speeds[2]` is the minimum of `v_1 + 2 * d` and `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`, and the rest (except the first, the last, and the second and third) are zeros, `i` is 2**
