Precondition: **v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed d, starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and lasting for t seconds.**
