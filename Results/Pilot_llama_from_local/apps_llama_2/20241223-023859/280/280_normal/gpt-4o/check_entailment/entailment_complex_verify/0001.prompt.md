You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the speeds for each second. The current implementation only considers the upper bound of the speed, but it does not consider the lower bound.

For example, consider the case where v1 = 10, v2 = 5, t = 4, and d = 2. The program will calculate the speeds as follows:

- speeds[0] = 10
- speeds[1] = min(10 + 2, 5 + (4 - 1 - 1) * 2) = min(12, 11) = 11
- speeds[2] = min(11 + 2, 5 + (4 - 2 - 1) * 2) = min(13, 9) = 9
- speeds[3] = 5

However, this results in speeds[1] being greater than speeds[2] + d, which violates the condition that the absolute value of the difference in speeds between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d.

To fix this issue, the program should consider both the upper and lower bounds of the speed when calculating the speeds for each second. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = min(max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d), min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v1 + i * d))
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed d, starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and lasting for t seconds.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` integers where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and for `1 <= i < t-1`, `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total distance traveled by an object that accelerates from an initial speed `v_1` to a final speed `v_2` over a period of `t` seconds, with a maximum acceleration of `d` units per second. The function takes four parameters: two initial speeds `v_1` and `v_2`, time `t`, and acceleration `d`, all of which are input integers. The function returns a single value, the total distance traveled, calculated by summing up a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed `d`. The final state of the program includes the total distance traveled, which is printed to the console. The function does not explicitly check if a valid sequence of speeds exists, but instead constructs a sequence that meets the acceleration constraint and calculates the total distance based on that sequence. The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges (1-100 for `v_1` and `v_2`, 2-100 for `t`, and 0-10 for `d`), but does not perform any explicit error checking.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
