Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the speeds for each second. The current implementation only considers the upper bound of the speed, but it does not consider the lower bound.

For example, consider the case where v1 = 10, v2 = 5, t = 4, and d = 2. The program will calculate the speeds as follows:

- speeds[0] = 10
- speeds[1] = min(10 + 2, 5 + (4 - 1 - 1) * 2) = min(12, 11) = 11
- speeds[2] = min(11 + 2, 5 + (4 - 2 - 1) * 2) = min(13, 9) = 9
- speeds[3] = 5

However, this results in speeds[1] being greater than speeds[2] + d, which violates the condition that the absolute value of the difference in speeds between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d.

To fix this issue, the program should consider both the upper and lower bounds of the speed when calculating the speeds for each second. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = min(max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d), min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v1 + i * d))
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
