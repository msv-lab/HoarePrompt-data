Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the maximum speed increase from the first second to the last second would exceed the given maximum speed change `d`. In the given code, the line `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` only considers increasing the speed by `d` each second and limits it to not exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. However, it does not consider the optimal case where the speed might need to decrease.

For example, if `v1 = 10`, `v2 = 5`, `t = 3`, and `d = 2`, the program would calculate the speeds as `[10, 10+2, 5] = [10, 12, 5]`. However, the optimal sequence of speeds would be `[10, 8, 5]` or `[10, 9, 5]` (if possible) to maximize the distance traveled. But the code does not handle such cases properly because it only adds speed and does not consider reducing speed if that would allow for a higher total distance.

The code should ideally consider both increasing and decreasing the speed by `d` each second and calculate the optimal sequence of speeds to maximize the distance traveled. The given code does not do this, making it incorrect.
