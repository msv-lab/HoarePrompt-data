The function calculates and returns the total distance traveled by an object that accelerates from an initial speed `v_1` to a final speed `v_2` over a period of `t` seconds, with a maximum acceleration of `d` units per second. The function takes four parameters: two initial speeds `v_1` and `v_2`, time `t`, and acceleration `d`, all of which are input integers. The function returns a single value, the total distance traveled, calculated by summing up a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between consecutive speeds does not exceed `d`. The final state of the program includes the total distance traveled, which is printed to the console. The function does not explicitly check if a valid sequence of speeds exists, but instead constructs a sequence that meets the acceleration constraint and calculates the total distance based on that sequence. The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges (1-100 for `v_1` and `v_2`, 2-100 for `t`, and 0-10 for `d`), but does not perform any explicit error checking.
