Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately calculate the maximum possible length of the path section. 

The primary issue lies in the logic used to calculate `max_length`. The current implementation adds `max_speed` to `max_length` in each iteration, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to calculate the distance covered in each second and sum these distances to obtain the total length of the path.

Moreover, the code initializes `max_length` as `max_speed * t`, which is also incorrect. This initialization should be `max_speed` (the speed of the first second), and then in each iteration, the speed of the current second should be added to `max_length`.

Additionally, the code does not correctly adjust the speeds based on the given constraint `d`. The speeds should be adjusted in each second, ensuring that the difference between the speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_length = 0
    current_speed = v1
    for i in range(t):
        max_length += current_speed
        if i < t - 1:
            if current_speed < v2:
                current_speed = min(current_speed + d, v2)
            elif current_speed > v2:
                current_speed = max(current_speed - d, v2)
    print(max_length)
```
This corrected version ensures that the difference between the speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d` and calculates the maximum possible length of the path section accurately.
