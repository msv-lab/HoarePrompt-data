To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial conditions.

Initial State: 
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`
- `max_length` is `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed` * `t`
- `i` is `t - 1`

Given code:
```python
min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
```

The code updates the value of `min_speed` to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Since `min_speed` was initially the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, and now it's updated, we need to consider how this update affects the other variables. The update directly affects `min_speed` and indirectly affects `max_speed` because `max_speed` is defined in terms of `min_speed`.

- `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- Since `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` and `min_speed` has changed, we should note that `max_speed`'s definition involves the old `min_speed`. However, the update of `min_speed` does not directly modify `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, `i`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, or `d`.

Considering the interdependencies:
- `max_length` and `min_length` depend on `max_speed` and `min_speed`. Since `min_speed` has been updated, and if this update affects the value of `max_speed` (because `max_speed` is defined using `min_speed`), then `max_length` and `min_length` could potentially change. However, `max_length` and `min_length` are defined using the initial definitions of `max_speed` and `min_speed`, not the updated ones.

Given the code only explicitly updates `min_speed`, and considering the definitions:
- The explicit update is to `min_speed`.
- The definitions of `max_length` and `min_length` use the initial `min_speed` and `max_speed`, but `max_speed` itself is defined using `min_speed`. So, there's an indirect effect on `max_speed` due to the change in `min_speed`, but `max_length` and `min_length` aren't recalculated with the new `min_speed` or potentially updated `max_speed` in this step.

The output state, therefore, includes the updated `min_speed` but does not change the other variables' definitions based on the initial `min_speed` and `max_speed`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is initially `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` but now can be different due to the change in `min_speed`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t` based on initial conditions, `min_length` is `min_speed * t` based on initial `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 1`**
