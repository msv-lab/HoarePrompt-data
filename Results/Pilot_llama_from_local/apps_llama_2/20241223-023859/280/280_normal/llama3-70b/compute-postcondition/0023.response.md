It appears that the provided function definition is incomplete, as it does not include any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will describe the expected functionality.


The function `func` is expected to accept parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). 


Since the output is not specified, I will assume a general description based on the parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, where v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 2 and 100, and d is an integer between 0 and 10, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
