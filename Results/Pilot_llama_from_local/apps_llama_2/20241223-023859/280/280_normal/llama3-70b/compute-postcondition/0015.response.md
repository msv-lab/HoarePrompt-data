To determine the output state after the given code is executed, we need to analyze how each variable is affected.

- `min_length` is initially equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`. When `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`, its new value becomes `min_length + min_speed`. Given `min_length` was already `min_length + min_speed` (from the initial state description), the updated value of `min_length` after the code execution can be expressed as `(min_length + min_speed) + min_speed`, which simplifies to `min_length + 2*min_speed`.
- `i` remains unchanged as there's no operation performed on it.
- `t` must be at least 2; this condition does not change.
- `max_speed` is determined by `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`. This value does not change with the execution of the given code.
- `min_speed` is determined by `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. This also remains unchanged.
- `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, and this does not change with the execution of the given code.

Given these observations, the output state after executing the code `min_length += min_speed` is as follows:

Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, and `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
