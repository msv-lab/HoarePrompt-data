The value of `min_length` is calculated as `min_speed` * `t`, where `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max_speed` * `t`, `min_length` is `min_speed` * `t`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max_speed` * `t`, `min_length` is `min_speed` * `t`**
