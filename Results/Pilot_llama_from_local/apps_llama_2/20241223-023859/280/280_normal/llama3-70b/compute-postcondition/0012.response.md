The code provided updates the value of `max_speed` based on the values of `max_speed`, `d`, and `min_speed`. The new value of `max_speed` is the maximum between `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.

Given the initial state, we know that `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, and `t` must be at least 2. 

The new value of `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, 
`i` is 1, 
`t` must be at least 2, 
`max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
