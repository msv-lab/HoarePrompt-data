To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute as long as `t - 1` is greater than `0`, which implies that `t` must be at least `2`. The loop starts from `t - 1` and decrements by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than `1`.

Given the initial state:

- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`
- `max_length` is `max_speed` * `t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed` * `t`

We need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute. The variable `i` is introduced in the loop and takes values from `t - 1` down to `1`. 

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max_speed` * `t`, `min_length` is `min_speed` * `t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
