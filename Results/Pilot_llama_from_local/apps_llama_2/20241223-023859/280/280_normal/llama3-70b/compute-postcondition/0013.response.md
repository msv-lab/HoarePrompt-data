The value of `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, and `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, and `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**
