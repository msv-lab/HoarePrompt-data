The value of `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`. The value of `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, and `max_length` is increased by `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.


Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, and `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
