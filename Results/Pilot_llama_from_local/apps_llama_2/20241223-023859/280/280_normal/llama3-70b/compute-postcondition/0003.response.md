`min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. The value of `max_speed` is still the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`**
