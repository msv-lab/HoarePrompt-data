The value of `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`, so `max_length` becomes `max_length + max_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`, `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 3, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + maxSpeed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`, `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 3, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
