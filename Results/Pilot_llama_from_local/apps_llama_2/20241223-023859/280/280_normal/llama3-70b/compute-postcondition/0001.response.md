The code updates the values of `t` and `d` using the `map` function, which applies the `int` function to the input values split by spaces. 

The initial state of `v1` and `v2` is not affected by this code. The values of `t` and `d` are updated to the input integers.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
