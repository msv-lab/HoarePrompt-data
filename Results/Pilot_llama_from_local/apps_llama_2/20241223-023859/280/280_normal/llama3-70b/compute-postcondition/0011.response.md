According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (since it starts from `t - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration), `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decreased by 1, so `i` is 0, but since the loop condition is `i` greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` starts from `t-1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2 so that `i` becomes 1, then in the next iteration, `i` will be 0 but we need `i` to be greater than 0 so the last value of `i` that makes the loop execute one more time is `i` equals 1. Therefore `t` must be at least 2 for `i` to be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 2**
