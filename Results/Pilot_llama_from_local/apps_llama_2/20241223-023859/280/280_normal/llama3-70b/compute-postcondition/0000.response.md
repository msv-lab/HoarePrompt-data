The code assigns the values of two integers from the input to `v1` and `v2`. The previous values of `v1` and `v2` are overwritten by these new values. The input values are integers, but their exact values are not specified. The states of the other variables `t` and `d` are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10**
