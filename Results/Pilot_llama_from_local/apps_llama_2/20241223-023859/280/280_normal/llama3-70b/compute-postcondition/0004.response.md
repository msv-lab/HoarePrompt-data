The code calculates `max_length` as the product of `max_speed` and `t`. `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, and `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max_speed` * `t`**
