The given code snippet is `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. This line of code updates the value of `min_speed` to be the minimum between its current value plus `d` and `max_speed`.

Considering the initial state:
- `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be at least 3
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

After executing the given code, the value of `min_speed` is updated as specified, but since the initial state already includes the fact that `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, this operation does not change the fact that `min_speed` will still be the minimum between its previous value plus `d` and `max_speed`. 

However, considering the exact operation, it seems there might have been an oversight in interpreting the initial conditions as they already reflect the update for `min_speed`. The key point here is to recognize that the code given does not introduce a new condition but rather seems to affirm or reiterate the condition already stated for `min_speed` in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be at least 3
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is confirmed to be `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`, `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 3, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
