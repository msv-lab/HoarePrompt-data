To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to understand how each variable is affected by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `2*min_speed`
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be at least 3
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

The code to be executed is:
```python
min_length += min_speed
```

This line of code increments the value of `min_length` by `min_speed`. The previous value of `min_length` was its previous value plus `2*min_speed`, so after executing this line, `min_length` becomes its previous value plus `2*min_speed + min_speed`, which simplifies to its previous value plus `3*min_speed`.

Now, considering the impact on the program and the previous values of the affected variables:

- The value of `min_length` is updated to be its previous value plus `min_speed`, or more specifically, its previous value plus `3*min_speed` considering its previous update.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- The constraint on `t` remains the same; it must be at least 3.
- The values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` are not directly modified by this operation, so they remain as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` and `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, respectively.
- The value of `max_length` is also not directly modified, so it remains `max_length + max_speed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `min_length` is equal to its original previous value plus `3*min_speed`
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be at least 3
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

Output State: **`min_length` is its original previous value plus `3*min_speed`, `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 3, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed + max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
