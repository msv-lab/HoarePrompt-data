The code `min_length += min_speed` increments the value of `min_length` by the value of `min_speed`. Since the initial values of `min_length` and `min_speed` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `min_length` in terms of its previous value and `min_speed`. 

Output State: **`min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`**
