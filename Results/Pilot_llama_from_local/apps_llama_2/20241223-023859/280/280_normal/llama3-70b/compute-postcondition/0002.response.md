To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
max_speed = max(v1, v2)
```
This line of code calculates the maximum value between `v1` and `v2` and assigns it to the variable `max_speed`.

Given that `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `max_speed` will be equal to the larger of the two input integers `v1` and `v2`.

The values of `t` and `d` are not affected by this operation as they are not involved in the calculation.

Therefore, the output state is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, and `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`**
