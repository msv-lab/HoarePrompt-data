To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the impact of the code on the program.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `v1` is an input integer.
   - `v2` is an input integer.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - `max_speed` is initially `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` but can be different due to the change in `min_speed`.
   - `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
   - `max_length` is `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t` based on initial conditions.
   - `min_length` is `min_speed * t` based on initial `min_speed`.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code `max_length += max_speed` increments the `max_length` by the value of `max_speed`.

Given this, the only variable that changes is `max_length`. Therefore, we update `max_length` to be its original value plus `max_speed`. The original value of `max_length` is `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t`, so after the increment, `max_length` becomes `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t + max_speed`.

All other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, `i`) retain their initial values or conditions because the code does not modify them.

**Output State:**
**`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is initially `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` but now can be different due to the change in `min_speed`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `(max(max_speed - d, min_speed)) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
