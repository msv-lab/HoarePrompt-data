The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` was 0, so the new value of `years` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the conditions on `a` and `b` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3 times its initial value, `b` is 2 times its initial value, `years` is 1, and `a` is less than or equal to `6b`.
Output State: **`a` is 3 times its initial value, `b` is 2 times its initial value, `years` is 1, and `a` is less than or equal to `6b`**
