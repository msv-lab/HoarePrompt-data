The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. `a` is `3a` (initial value of `a` multiplied by 3), and `years` is 0. The condition that `a` is less than or equal to `b` is no longer guaranteed, instead `a` is less than or equal to `3b`. After multiplying `b` by 2, `a` is less than or equal to `3b` becomes `a` is less than or equal to `3 * (2 * b)` which simplifies to `a` is less than or equal to `6b`. 
So, the value of `b` becomes `2b`. 
Output State: **`a` is 3 times its initial value, `b` is 2 times its initial value (i.e., `2b`), `years` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `6b`.**
