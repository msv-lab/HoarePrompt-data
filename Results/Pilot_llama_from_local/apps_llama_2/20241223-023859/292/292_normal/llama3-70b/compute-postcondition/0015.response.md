The code `print(years)` simply prints the value of the variable `years` to the console. This operation does not modify the values of any variables. 

Given that `a` is greater than `b` and `years` is the number of iterations required for `a` to exceed `b` given their initial values, with `a` being `3^years * a_init` and `b` being `2^years * b_init` just before the last iteration where `a` exceeds `b`, the states of these variables are not affected by the `print` statement.

The value of `years` is printed, but this does not change the fact that `years` represents the number of iterations required for `a` to exceed `b` under the given conditions. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than `b`, `years` is the number of iterations required for `a` to exceed `b` given their initial values, with `a` being `3^years * a_init` and `b` being `2^years * b_init` just before the last iteration where `a` exceeds `b`, and the value of `years` has been printed.
Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is the number of iterations required for `a` to exceed `b` given their initial values, with `a` being `3^years * a_init` and `b` being `2^years * b_init` just before the last iteration where `a` exceeds `b`, and the value of `years` has been printed.**
