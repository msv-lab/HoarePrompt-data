According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` and `b` are integers assigned from user input, and `years` is 0. The values of `a` and `b` being integers do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `a` being less than or equal to `b`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers assigned from user input and `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, `years` is 0**
