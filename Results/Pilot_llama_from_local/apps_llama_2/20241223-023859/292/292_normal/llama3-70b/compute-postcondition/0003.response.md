The code multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The value of `b` and `years` remains unchanged. Since `a` was less than or equal to `b` initially, after multiplication by 3, `a` is now less than or equal to `3b`. 

Output State: **`a` is `3a` (initial value of a multiplied by 3), `b` is an integer assigned from user input, `years` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `b` is no longer guaranteed, instead `a` is less than or equal to `3b`.**
