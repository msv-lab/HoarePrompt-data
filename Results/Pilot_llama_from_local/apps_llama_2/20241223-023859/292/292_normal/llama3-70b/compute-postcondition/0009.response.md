The value of `years` is incremented by 1, so `years` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `9 * a_init`, `b` is `4 * b_init`, `years` is 2, and `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init`.
Output State: **`a` is `9 * a_init`, `b` is `4 * b_init`, `years` is 2, and `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init`**
