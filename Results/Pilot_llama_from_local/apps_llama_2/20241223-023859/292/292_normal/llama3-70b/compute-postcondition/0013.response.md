The code increments the value of `years` by 1. The initial state is: `a` is `27 * a_init`, `b` is `8 * b_init`, `years` is 2, and `27 * a_init` <= `12 * b_init`. After the increment operation, `years` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is `27 * a_init`, `b` is `8 * b_init`, `years` is 3, and `27 * a_init` <= `12 * b_init`**
