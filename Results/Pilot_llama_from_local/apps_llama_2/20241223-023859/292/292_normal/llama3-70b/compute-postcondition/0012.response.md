The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Initially, `b` is `4 * b_init`, so after doubling, `b` becomes `8 * b_init`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `27 * a_init` is less than or equal to `12 * b_init`, and `b` is now `8 * b_init`, the relation becomes `27 * a_init` <= `12 * (b / 8)`, which simplifies to `27 * a_init` <= `1.5 * b`. But in terms of the original `b_init`, the condition `27 * a_init` <= `12 * b_init` still holds, and `b` is now `8 * b_init`. 

The value of `a` remains `27 * a_init`, and `years` remains 2.

Output State: **`a` is `27 * a_init`, `b` is `8 * b_init`, `years` is 2, and `27 * a_init` <= `12 * b_init`**
