The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is `2 * b_init`, so after the code is executed, `b` becomes `2 * (2 * b_init)`, which simplifies to `4 * b_init`. The values of `a` and `years` are not affected by this operation, and the condition `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init` remains as a precondition since it does not depend on the value of `b` directly after the operation but rather on the initial values of `a_init` and `b_init`.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `9 * a_init`, `b` is `4 * b_init`, `years` is 1, and the condition `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init` still holds.

Output State: **`a` is `9 * a_init`, `b` is `4 * b_init`, `years` is 1, and `3 * a_init <= 2 * b_init`**
