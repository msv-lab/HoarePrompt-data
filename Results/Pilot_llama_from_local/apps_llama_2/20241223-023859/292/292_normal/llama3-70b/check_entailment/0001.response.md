Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct. It accurately implements the problem description. 

The program takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob, then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight in each iteration, incrementing the year counter. The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's, at which point it prints the number of years that have passed.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Additionally, the program correctly handles the edge case where the initial weights of Limak and Bob are equal, as demonstrated by the third example.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly follows the problem description. It checks for the condition where Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, which is exactly as per the problem description. 

Therefore, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and hence it is correct.
