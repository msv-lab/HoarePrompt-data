Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively.

2. It initializes a variable `years` to 0, which will keep track of the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

3. The program then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.

4. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).

5. After the weights are updated, the `years` counter is incremented by 1.

6. The loop repeats steps 3-5 until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

7. Once the loop ends, the program prints the number of `years` it took for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

This logic aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the number of full years it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight, given that Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles each year.

Since the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases (given the constraints of `1 <= a <= b <= 10`), it is correct.
