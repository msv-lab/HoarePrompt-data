Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct for every potential case as described in the problem description. It accurately simulates the process of Limak's weight being tripled and Bob's weight being doubled each year, and it correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

The while loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. Inside the loop, the weights are updated by multiplying `a` by 3 and `b` by 2, and the `years` counter is incremented by 1. Once the loop condition is no longer met (i.e., Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight), the number of years is printed to the console.

The code handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, when the input is 4 and 7, the code output is 2, which is correct. Similarly, when the input is 4 and 9, the code output is 3, which is also correct. Additionally, when the input is 1 and 1, the code output is 1, which is correct as well.

Since the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all the provided examples correctly, and we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., two integers between 1 and 10, where the first integer is less than or equal to the second), the code can be considered correct for every potential case.
