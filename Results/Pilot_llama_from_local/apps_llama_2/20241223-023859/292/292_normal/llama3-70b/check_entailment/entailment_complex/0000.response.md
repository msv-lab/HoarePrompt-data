Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, which represent Limak's and Bob's initial weights, respectively.
2. The program uses a while loop to simulate the passage of years. In each iteration, it multiplies `a` by 3 (to represent Limak's weight tripling) and `b` by 2 (to represent Bob's weight doubling).
3. The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`, which means Limak is not yet heavier than Bob.
4. Once `a` exceeds `b`, the loop exits, and the program prints the number of years that have passed, which is stored in the `years` variable.
5. The program's logic is correct because it accurately models the problem description's requirements:
	* Limak's weight is tripled every year, and Bob's weight is doubled every year.
	* The program continues to simulate years until Limak becomes heavier than Bob.
	* The program prints the correct number of years required for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

The program's correctness is also evident from the provided examples:

* Input: 4 7, Output: 2 (correct)
* Input: 4 9, Output: 3 (correct)
* Input: 1 1, Output: 1 (correct)

In each case, the program correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become heavier than Bob, which matches the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description's specifications.
