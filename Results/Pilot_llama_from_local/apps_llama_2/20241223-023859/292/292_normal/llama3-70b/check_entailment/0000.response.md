Correctness: **True**

The given Python program simulates the weight increase of Limak and Bob over the years. It starts by taking two inputs, `a` and `b`, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The program then enters a while loop, which continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.

Inside the loop, Limak's weight `a` is tripled and Bob's weight `b` is doubled in each iteration. The number of years is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop exits when Limak's weight `a` exceeds Bob's weight `b`. At this point, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

The program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It takes into account the initial weights of Limak and Bob, simulates the weight increase over the years, and outputs the number of years it takes for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. The while loop ensures that the program continues to simulate the weight increase until Limak becomes heavier than Bob, and the years variable keeps track of the number of years it takes for this to happen.

The provided examples also demonstrate the program's correctness, and there are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the program's implementation, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
