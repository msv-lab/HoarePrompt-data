Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `a` is Limak's weight and `b` is Bob's weight, and calculates the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

The function uses a while loop to simulate the process of Limak's weight being tripled and Bob's weight being doubled in each year. The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The number of years is incremented in each iteration of the loop, and the final value of `years` is printed to the console.

The function assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., `a` and `b` will be integers within the range 1 to 10, and `a` will not be greater than `b`. Under these assumptions, the function correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become larger than Bob.

The output hints provided agree with the code, and the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the function. For instance, when `a = 4` and `b = 7`, the function correctly outputs `2`, and when `a = 4` and `b = 9`, the function correctly outputs `3`. Similarly, when `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the function correctly outputs `1`.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
