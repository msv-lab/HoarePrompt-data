The code multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial value of `a` is 9 * `a_orig`. So, the new value of `a` will be 3 * 9 * `a_orig`, which is 27 * `a_orig`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `b` is still an integer and equal to 4 * `b_orig`, and the conditions `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` and `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig` are still valid. Also, `years` is still increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 27 * `a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to 4 * `b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, and `years` is increased by 1**
