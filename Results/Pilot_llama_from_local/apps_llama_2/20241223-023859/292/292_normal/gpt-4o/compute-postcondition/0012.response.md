The given code snippet is `b *= 2`, which means the value of `b` is doubled. Given the initial state, `b` is an integer and equal to `4 * b_orig`. 

After doubling `b`, its new value becomes `2 * 4 * b_orig = 8 * b_orig`. The states of the other variables, `a`, `a_orig`, `b_orig`, and the relationship between `a_orig` and `b_orig` are not affected by this operation.

Given that `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` and `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, these conditions still hold true and provide constraints on the possible values of `a_orig` and `b_orig`. However, the specific relationship between `a` and `b` after the operation is now `a` is an integer and equal to `27 * a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to `8 * b_orig`.

Also, since `years` is increased by 1, its new value is one more than its previous value, but the exact value of `years` isn't specified, so we can only confirm it has been incremented.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer and equal to `27 * a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to `8 * b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, and `years` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to `27 * a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to `8 * b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, and `years` is increased by 1**
