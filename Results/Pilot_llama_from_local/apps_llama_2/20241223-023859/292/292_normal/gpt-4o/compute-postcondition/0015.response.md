The provided Python code snippet is `print(years)`. This code prints the value of the variable `years` but does not modify it or any other variable. 

Output State: **`years` is the number of iterations until `3^years * a_orig > 2^years * b_orig`, `a` is `3^years * a_orig`, and `b` is `2^years * b_orig`, where `a_orig` and `b_orig` are the original values of `a` and `b`, respectively. If `a_orig > b_orig`, then the printed `years` is 0, and `a` and `b` retain their original values. The value of `years` has been printed.**
