The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`a` is still an integer and equal to `27 * a_orig`, 
`b` is still an integer and equal to `8 * b_orig`, 
`2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, 
`9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, 
and `years` is increased by 1 + 1 = 2.
Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to `27 * a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to `8 * b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, and `years` is increased by 2**
