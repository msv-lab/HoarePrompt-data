The code `b *= 2` is executed. This means the value of `b` is multiplied by 2. 

The value of `a` is 3 times its original value, but we do not know what its original value is. The value of `years` is 0. 

After execution, `a` is still an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, `years` is 0, and `b` is now equal to 2 times its original value.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value, `years` is 0**
