The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. The value of `a` was an integer and less than or equal to `b`, so the new value of `a` is 3 times its original integer value, which is also an integer. Since the original `a` was less than or equal to `b`, the new value of `a` (3 times the original `a`) is less than or equal to 3 times `b`. However, we cannot directly compare the new `a` to the original `b` without knowing their exact values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3 times its original integer value and is an integer, `b` is an integer, `years` is 0, and the original relationship `a` <= `b` becomes 3*a_original <= `b` or `a` <= 3*`b`, but since `a` has been multiplied by 3, the direct comparison to `b` is `a` <= 3*`b`, and the original `a` is lost, so we keep in mind that `a` started as an integer less than or equal to `b`, and now `a` is an integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, `b` is an integer, and `years` is 0**
