The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is unknown. The states of the other variables `a`, `b`, `a_orig`, and `b_orig` are not affected. The relationship `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` remains valid. `a` is still an integer and equal to 9 times its original value (`a_orig`), and `b` is an integer and equal to 4 times its original value (`b_orig`).

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 9 * `a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to 4 * `b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, and `years` is increased by 1**
