To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value. Let's denote the original value of `a` as `a_orig`. Then, `a = 3 * a_orig`.
- `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value. Let's denote the original value of `b` as `b_orig`. Then, `b = 2 * b_orig`.
- `b` must be greater than or equal to `a`, so `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
a *= 3
```
This operation multiplies the current value of `a` by 3.

Since `a = 3 * a_orig`, after the operation, `a` becomes `3 * (3 * a_orig) = 9 * a_orig`.

The value of `b` and the relationship between `b` and `a` before the operation were `b = 2 * b_orig` and `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, respectively. After the operation, `b` remains unchanged, but the relationship between `b` and the new value of `a` needs to be considered. The new `a` is `9 * a_orig`, so the condition `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` still holds, but now `b = 2 * b_orig` is compared to the new `a = 9 * a_orig`. 

However, the initial condition that `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` (`2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`) does not directly apply to the new value of `a` after multiplication by 3, because `a` has changed. The new relationship considering the original condition would be `b = 2 * b_orig` and the new `a = 9 * a_orig`. The condition `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` ensured `b` was greater than or equal to the original `a`, but after `a` is multiplied by 3, the relationship between `b` and the new `a` is `2 * b_orig` compared to `9 * a_orig`. 

To maintain the format and directly address the changes:
- `a` is now equal to 9 times its original value (`a = 9 * a_orig`).
- `b` remains an integer and equal to 2 times its original value (`b = 2 * b_orig`).
- The relationship that `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` initially meant `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, but after the change, `b`'s value does not change, so it's still `2 * b_orig`, and `a`'s new value is `9 * a_orig`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 9 times its original value, `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value, and initially, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`**
