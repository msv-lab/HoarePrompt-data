To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the condition of the `while` loop.

The `while` loop condition is `a <= b`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `a` is an integer and equal to 9 * `a_orig`.
- `b` is an integer and equal to 4 * `b_orig`.
- `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`.
- `years` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `a <= b` must hold true. Substituting the given values of `a` and `b` in terms of `a_orig` and `b_orig`, we get:
- `a = 9 * a_orig`
- `b = 4 * b_orig`

The condition for the loop to continue is `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`. 

Given `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, we can see that this does not directly guarantee that `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig` because the multipliers are different. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `a` (which is `9 * a_orig`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `4 * b_orig`) after the adjustments.

We cannot directly infer the relationship between `a_orig` and `b_orig` that guarantees `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig` from `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` without making specific assumptions about the values of `a_orig` and `b_orig`. However, to ensure the loop can run again based on the condition `a <= b`, we need to consider how `a` and `b` are updated.

Since we don't have explicit update rules for `a` and `b` within the loop body, and we are only considering the condition for the loop to continue, we focus on the requirement that `a` must be less than or equal to `b` for the next iteration.

Given that `a = 9 * a_orig` and `b = 4 * b_orig`, and knowing that `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, for the loop to execute one more time, it must be true that `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`. However, without explicit update rules or more specific relationships between `a_orig` and `b_orig`, we must recognize that for `a` to be less than or equal to `b` in the next iteration, the relationship between `a_orig` and `b_orig` must be such that it supports this condition after any updates that might occur within the loop.

Since `years` is increased by 1, but there's no direct relationship given between `years` and the condition `a <= b`, the change in `years` does not directly impact our analysis of whether `a <= b` can be true for the next iteration based on the information provided.

State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 9 * `a_orig`, `b` is an integer and equal to 4 * `b_orig`, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, `9 * a_orig <= 4 * b_orig`, and `years` is increased by 1**
