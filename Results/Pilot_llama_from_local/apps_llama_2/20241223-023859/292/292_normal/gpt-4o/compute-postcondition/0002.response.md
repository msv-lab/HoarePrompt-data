To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to consider the condition that must be met for the loop to proceed: `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. Given that `a` and `b` are integers assigned the input values, with `a` being the first input and `b` being the second, and `years` is 0, we should focus on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are determined by the user's input, without any constraints provided in the initial state regarding their values relative to each other, the condition for the loop to execute (`a <= b`) must be ensured by adjusting the understanding of `a` and `b`'s relationship. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `a` should be less than or equal to `b`. The state of `years` being 0 does not affect the condition for the loop to start executing, as the loop's condition depends solely on the values of `a` and `b`.

Thus, considering the initial conditions and the requirement for the loop to execute, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `a` is indeed less than or equal to `b`, which can be achieved by the user's input reflecting this relationship.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and `years` is 0**
