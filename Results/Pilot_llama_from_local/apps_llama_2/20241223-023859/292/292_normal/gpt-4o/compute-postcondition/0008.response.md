To calculate the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given code.

Initially, `a` is an integer and equal to 9 times its original value (`a_orig`), and `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value (`b_orig`). Also, initially, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`.

Given the relationship between `a`, `b`, and their original values:
- `a = 9 * a_orig`
- `b = 2 * b_orig`

The code multiplies `b` by 2:
```python
b *= 2
```
This operation changes `b` to be `2 * b`, which, given its original definition, results in `b` being `2 * (2 * b_orig) = 4 * b_orig`.

Now, let's consider the condition `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`. Since `a = 9 * a_orig`, substituting `a_orig` in terms of `a` gives us `a_orig = a / 9`. Thus, the condition can be rewritten as `2 * b_orig >= 3 * (a / 9)`.

Substituting `b_orig` in terms of `b` (considering `b` before it was doubled) gives us `b_orig = b / 2`. Therefore, the condition becomes `2 * (b / 2) >= 3 * (a / 9)`, which simplifies to `b >= (a / 3)`.

After doubling `b`, the new value of `b` is `4 * b_orig`, and the condition in terms of the new `b` and original `a` and `b` relationship does not directly apply as the original relation was given in terms of `a_orig` and `b_orig`. However, since `b` has been doubled, its relationship to `a` changes in the context of the `>=` condition. The new `b` is `4 * b_orig`, and since `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`, doubling `b` to `4 * b_orig` would logically maintain or increase the margin of `b` in relation to `3 * a_orig`, given the multiplication increases `b`'s value.

Thus, considering `a` remains `9 * a_orig` and the new `b` is `4 * b_orig`, the output state becomes:
- `a` is an integer and equal to 9 times its original value.
- `b` is an integer and equal to 4 times its original value.

The condition `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig` still holds in the context of the original values, but now `b` is `4 * b_orig`, indicating `b` has increased, potentially affecting any comparison or condition involving `b` and `a` or their original values.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 9 times its original value (`a_orig`), `b` is an integer and equal to 4 times its original value (`b_orig`), and initially, `2 * b_orig >= 3 * a_orig`**
