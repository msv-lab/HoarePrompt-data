The code `years += 1` increments the value of `years` by 1. Initially, `years` is 0, so after the increment, `years` becomes 1. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code. 

Given that `a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, and `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value, we can represent their original values as `a_original` and `b_original` respectively. Thus, `a = 3 * a_original` and `b = 2 * b_original`. 

Since the code only changes the value of `years`, the output state is: `a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value, `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and equal to 3 times its original value, `b` is an integer and equal to 2 times its original value, `years` is 1**
