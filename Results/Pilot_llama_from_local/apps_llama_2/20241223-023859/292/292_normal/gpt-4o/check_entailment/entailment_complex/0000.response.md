Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem asks to find the number of full years it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight, given their initial weights and growth rates.

The program uses a while loop to simulate the growth of Limak's and Bob's weights over time. In each iteration, it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight, and increments the year counter. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's weight.

The program correctly handles all cases, including when Limak's initial weight is equal to Bob's initial weight, or when Limak's initial weight is smaller than Bob's initial weight. It also correctly calculates the number of years until Limak becomes strictly larger than Bob.

The program's logic is sound, and it always returns the correct result for any valid input. The annotations provided also accurately describe the program's behavior and the state of the program at different points in time.

For example, given the input `4 7`, the program correctly outputs `2`, because after two years, Limak's weight becomes `36` (which is `4 * 3^2`) and Bob's weight becomes `28` (which is `7 * 2^2`).

Similarly, given the input `4 9`, the program correctly outputs `3`, because after three years, Limak's weight becomes `108` (which is `4 * 3^3`) and Bob's weight becomes `72` (which is `9 * 2^3`).

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and always returns the correct result for any valid input.
