Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It takes two integer inputs from the user, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, and returns the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The function handles cases where the initial weight of Limak is less than or equal to Bob's weight, and it correctly calculates the number of years until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight. The function assumes Limak's weight is tripled each year, while Bob's weight is doubled each year. 

The while loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The code handles cases where the initial weights are equal, correctly calculating the number of years until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight. 

The provided examples also work correctly with the given code. For instance, when the input is `4 7`, the output is `2`, which matches the expected output according to the problem description. Similarly, for the inputs `4 9` and `1 1`, the outputs are `3` and `1`, respectively, which also match the expected outputs.

Overall, the code appears to correctly implement the problem description, and it handles all the potential cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
