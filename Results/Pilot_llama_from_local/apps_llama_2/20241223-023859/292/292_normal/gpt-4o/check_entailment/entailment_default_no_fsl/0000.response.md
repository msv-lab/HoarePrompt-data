Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The while loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. Inside the loop, the weights are updated according to the problem description (Limak's weight is tripled, and Bob's weight is doubled). The `years` variable is incremented at the end of each iteration to keep track of the number of years.

The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints. For example:

- When the initial weights are equal (e.g., `a = 1`, `b = 1`), the code correctly returns `1`, as Limak becomes larger than Bob after one year.
- When the initial weights are not equal (e.g., `a = 4`, `b = 7`), the code correctly returns the number of years it takes for Limak to become larger than Bob.
- The code also handles cases where the initial weight of Limak is smaller than Bob's weight, as guaranteed by the problem description.

Since we assume the input will be valid, the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not valid (e.g., not integers, out of range). Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the code is correct for every potential case.
