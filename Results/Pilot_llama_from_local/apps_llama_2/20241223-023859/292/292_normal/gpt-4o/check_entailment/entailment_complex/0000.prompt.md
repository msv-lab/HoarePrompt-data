You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `years` is the number of iterations until `3^years * a_orig > 2^years * b_orig`, `a` is `3^years * a_orig`, and `b` is `2^years * b_orig`, where `a_orig` and `b_orig` are the original values of `a` and `b`, respectively. If `a_orig > b_orig`, then `years` is 0, and `a` and `b` retain their original values.
    print(years)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the number of years it takes for the population of a species to surpass the population of another species, given their initial populations and growth rates. It takes two integer inputs from the user, representing the initial populations of the two species, and returns the number of years until the population of the first species exceeds the population of the second species. The function assumes the first species grows at a rate of 3 times its current population per year, and the second species grows at a rate of 2 times its current population per year. The function handles cases where the initial population of the first species is greater than the initial population of the second species, returning 0 years in such cases. The function also handles cases where the initial populations are equal, correctly calculating the number of years until the first species surpasses the second. Note that the function does not handle cases where the user input is not valid (i.e., not integers or out of the specified range), and it does not provide any error handling or input validation.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
