Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the problem description. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, and then calculates the number of full years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `a` and `b` with the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively.
2. **Loop condition**: The while loop condition `a <= b` is correct, as it continues to iterate until Limak's weight is strictly larger than Bob's weight.
3. **Weight updates**: Inside the loop, the program updates the weights of Limak and Bob by multiplying `a` by 3 and `b` by 2, respectively, which is in line with the problem description.
4. **Year increment**: The `years` variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration, which accurately represents the passage of time.
5. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob, which is stored in the `years` variable.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `a` is equal to `b`, the loop will run for at least 1 year, as expected.
* When `a` is smaller than `b`, the loop will continue to iterate until `a` is strictly larger than `b`.
* When the input values are within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will produce the correct output.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the expected output for all valid input cases.
