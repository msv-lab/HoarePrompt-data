Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the problem description. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, and then enters a loop where it continuously triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. 

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It starts by taking the weights of Limak and Bob as input, and then the while loop ensures that it increments the years until the condition `a <= b` is no longer met. This condition guarantees that Limak will be strictly heavier than Bob when the loop ends.

The provided examples in the problem description (e.g., `4 7`, `4 9`, and `1 1`) all produce the expected outputs. 

Additionally, the program can correctly handle edge cases such as when Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, or when Limak's weight is much smaller than Bob's. For instance, if the input is `1 1`, the program will output `1`, which is correct because after one year, Limak will weigh `3` (1*3) and Bob will weigh `2` (1*2), making Limak strictly heavier.

Since the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
