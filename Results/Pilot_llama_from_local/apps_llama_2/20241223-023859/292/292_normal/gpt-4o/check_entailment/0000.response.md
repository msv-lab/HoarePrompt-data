Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The program uses a simple while loop to simulate the weight increase of both Limak and Bob over the years. 

In each iteration of the loop, the weights of both Limak and Bob are updated according to the given rules (Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled), and the number of years is incremented. The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly larger than Bob's weight.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where Limak and Bob have initial weights of 1. The program also correctly handles cases where Limak and Bob have equal initial weights, as demonstrated in the example where both have an initial weight of 1.

The code is straightforward, easy to understand, and effectively solves the problem. It correctly follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all the provided examples.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided examples, it can be concluded that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
