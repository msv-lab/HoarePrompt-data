Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `dp` has at least `i+1` elements, `volumes` has at least `i+1` elements. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its previous value `volumes[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, and `j` is 0. If `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains equal to `volumes[i]`.***
