Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `dp` has at least `i+2` elements, `volumes` has at least `i+2` elements, `j` is 1. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + volumes[i]`.***
