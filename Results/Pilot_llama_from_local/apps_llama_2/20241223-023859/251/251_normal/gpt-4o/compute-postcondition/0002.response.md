The given code is a list comprehension that updates the value of `cakes`. The previous value of `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples. The new value of `cakes` is also a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers.

The expression `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` generates each tuple in the list. This expression converts the string values at indices `2 * i + 1` and `2 * i + 2` in the `data` list to integers.

The values of `n` and `data` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers equal to `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces**
