Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `i` is an integer greater than 1, and if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` retains its previous value.***
