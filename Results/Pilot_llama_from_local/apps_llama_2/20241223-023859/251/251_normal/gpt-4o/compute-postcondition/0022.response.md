The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `dp` (except `dp[i]`), `volumes`, and `j` are not changed. 

Since `i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `i` is at least 2. `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, so `n` is at least 4. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `dp` has at least `i+2` elements and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, `volumes` has at least `i+2` elements, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `dp` has at least `i+2` elements and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + volumes[i]`, `volumes` has at least `i+2` elements, `j` is 0**
