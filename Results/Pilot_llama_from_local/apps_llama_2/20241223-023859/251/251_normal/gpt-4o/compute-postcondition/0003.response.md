The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, but we can still analyze the impact on the program. 

The values of `n`, `cakes`, and `data` are not changed by the code. 

`result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, cakes)`, which is a function call with `n` and `cakes` as arguments. 

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can express it as the return value of `func_1` when called with `n` and `cakes` as arguments.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers equal to `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers equal to `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`**
