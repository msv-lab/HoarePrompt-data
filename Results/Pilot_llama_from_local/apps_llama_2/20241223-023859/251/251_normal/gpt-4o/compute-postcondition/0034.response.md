According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 0. Since the loop iterates over the range of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `n`. The value of `n` remains the same as it is greater than the previous `n`. The number of elements in `dp` and `volumes` also remains the same. The loop starts from the beginning, so `j` will start from 0 again in the next iteration. 
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 0**
