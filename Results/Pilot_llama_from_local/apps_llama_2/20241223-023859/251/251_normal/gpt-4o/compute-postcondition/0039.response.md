Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 1. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[1]` plus `volumes[i]`.***
