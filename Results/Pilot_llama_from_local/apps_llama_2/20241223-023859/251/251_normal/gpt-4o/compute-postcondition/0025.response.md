The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` is not specified, so it is updated based on the comparison. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `i` is still a positive integer increased by 1. The condition `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2` is still valid. The `dp` and `volumes` lists still have at least `i+2` elements. The value of `j` is still 1.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `dp` has at least `i+2` elements, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + volumes[i]`, `volumes` has at least `i+2` elements, `j` is 1**
