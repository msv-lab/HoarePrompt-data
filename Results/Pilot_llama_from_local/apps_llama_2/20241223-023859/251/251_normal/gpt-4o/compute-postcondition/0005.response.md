The function `func_2` seems to be missing its parameters based on the provided parameter constraints. Given the constraints, it should accept two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is a positive integer, and `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.

However, since the function definition provided as `def func_2():` does not include any parameters, I will proceed with the understanding that the parameters should be `n` and `cakes` as described, even though they are not explicitly listed in the function definition.

The functionality of the function, given the corrected understanding of its parameters, is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, each containing two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. Since the specific return values or conditions are not provided, the functionality description will focus on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.**
