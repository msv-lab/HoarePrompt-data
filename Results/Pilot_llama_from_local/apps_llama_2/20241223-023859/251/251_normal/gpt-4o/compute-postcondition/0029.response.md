The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `volumes[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `n + 1`, we can substitute this into the expression to get `dp[n + 1] = volumes[n + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still greater than the previous `n`, and both `dp` and `volumes` still have at least `n + 1` elements. 

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements and `dp[n + 1]` is equal to `volumes[n + 1]`, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements**
