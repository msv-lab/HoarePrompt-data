According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop counter `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Since `j` is the loop counter, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and since `j` must be less than `i` to execute the loop again, `i` must still be greater than `j`.
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 1**
