Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 0, and if the current value of `volumes[j]` is less than the current value of `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of `volumes[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.**
