The given code prints the value of `result` with six decimal places. The value of `result` is not changed by the code, it is only printed. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers equal to `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)` and the value of `result` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers equal to `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)` and the value of `result` has been printed as `{result:.6f}`**
