The given code `data = input().split()` reads an input, splits it into a list of strings using space as a delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state of `n` and `cakes` does not change because this code does not modify or access these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces**
