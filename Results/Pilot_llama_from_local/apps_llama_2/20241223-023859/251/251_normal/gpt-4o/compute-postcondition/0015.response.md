According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at some value, `n` is greater than this value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
