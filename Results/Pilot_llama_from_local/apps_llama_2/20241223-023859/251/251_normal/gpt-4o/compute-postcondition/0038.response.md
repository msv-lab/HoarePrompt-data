The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `dp` has at least `n + 1` elements, `dp[i]` is equal to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + volumes[i])`, `volumes` has at least `n + 1` elements, `j` is 1**
