Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `i` is an integer greater than 0, and `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `volumes[0]` and for any `i` greater than 0, if there exists a `j` where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` equals `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
