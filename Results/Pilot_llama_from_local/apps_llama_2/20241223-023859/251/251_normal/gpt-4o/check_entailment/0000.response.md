Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the input is being read in `func_2()`. The line `cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]` assumes that all the input data is available in the `data` list, which is not the case.

The input is provided in the following format:
```
n
r1 h1
r2 h2
...
rn hn
```
However, the `func_2()` function reads the input using `input().split()`, which only reads the first line of the input. Therefore, the `data` list only contains the number `n`, and not the radius and height values of the cakes.

To fix this issue, the input should be read line by line, and the radius and height values should be extracted from each line. Here's an example of how the input can be read correctly:

```python
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((r, h))
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

This corrected version of `func_2()` reads the input line by line, extracts the radius and height values from each line, and appends them to the `cakes` list. This ensures that all the input data is read correctly and the program works as expected.
