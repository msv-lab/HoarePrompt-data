Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to accurately solve the problem described. It calculates the volume of each cake and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking the cakes, considering the constraints that a cake can only be placed on top of another cake if its volume is greater.

The `func_1` function correctly implements this logic, iterating over each cake and updating its maximum volume by considering all previous cakes that are smaller in volume. The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1`, and prints the result with the required precision.

The output hints for `func_1` and `func_2` agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the code is correct for all potential cases. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the code efficiently finds the optimal solution for any valid input. 

The volume calculation itself is also accurate, using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (`Ï€ * r^2 * h`), which matches the problem description. 

Overall, based on the provided code and descriptions, the program appears to meet all the requirements and correctly solves the problem as described.
