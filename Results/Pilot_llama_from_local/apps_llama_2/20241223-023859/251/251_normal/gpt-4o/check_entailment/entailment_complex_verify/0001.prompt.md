You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that it incorrectly reads the input in the `func_2()` function. The line `cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]` attempts to parse the input data directly from the first line, which only contains the number of cakes `n`. The program should instead read `n` cakes from the subsequent lines.

A correct version of the `func_2()` function should read the input lines for the cakes' dimensions separately. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        cake_data = input().split()
        cakes.append((int(cake_data[0]), int(cake_data[1])))
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

This corrected version reads the dimensions of each cake separately, allowing the program to correctly calculate the maximum volume of the cake. The original program would fail to work as expected due to incorrect input parsing.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of pairs of positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake, such that the length of cakes is equal to n.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the variable dp
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes in a specific order, given the volumes of cakes with different radii and heights. The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` of pairs of positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes, considering that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if the volume of the cake below is less than the volume of the cake above. The function handles cases where cakes cannot be stacked, in which case it returns the volume of the cake with the largest volume. It also handles cases where the input list `cakes` has a length equal to `n`, ensuring that the function processes all cakes. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid, i.e., `n` is a positive integer and `cakes` is a list of pairs of positive integers with a length equal to `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers, representing the radius and height of a cake.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` reads input from the user, processes it into a list of cake dimensions, and then calls another function `func_1` with this data. It then prints the result of `func_1` to the console with six decimal places of precision. The input is expected to be in a specific format, starting with a positive integer `n` followed by `n` tuples of two positive integers each, representing the radius and height of a cake. If the input does not match this format, the function may fail or produce unexpected results. The function does not perform any validation on the input data, so it assumes that the user will provide correct and valid input. After the function concludes, the state of the program will include the printed result and any side effects from the execution of `func_1`, which are not specified in the given annotations. The original input variables `n` and `cakes` are not modified by `func_2` itself but are used to compute the result from `func_1`. The actual modification or usage of these variables depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
