Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that it incorrectly reads the input in the `func_2()` function. The line `cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]` attempts to parse the input data directly from the first line, which only contains the number of cakes `n`. The program should instead read `n` cakes from the subsequent lines.

A correct version of the `func_2()` function should read the input lines for the cakes' dimensions separately. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        cake_data = input().split()
        cakes.append((int(cake_data[0]), int(cake_data[1])))
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

This corrected version reads the dimensions of each cake separately, allowing the program to correctly calculate the maximum volume of the cake. The original program would fail to work as expected due to incorrect input parsing.
