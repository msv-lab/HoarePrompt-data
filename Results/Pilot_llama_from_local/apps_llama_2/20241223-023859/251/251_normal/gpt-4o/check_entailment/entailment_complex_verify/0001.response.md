Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I have evaluated the provided program.

The original assessment points out a crucial issue in the `func_2()` function, where the program incorrectly reads the input. Specifically, the line `cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]` is attempting to parse the input data directly from the first line, which only contains the number of cakes `n`. This approach is incorrect because the subsequent lines contain the dimensions of each cake.

However, the annotated version of the code does not accurately reflect the correct input processing. The corrected version of `func_2()` provided in the original assessment is necessary to correctly read the cake dimensions from the input.

Given this information, I agree with the original assessment that the program does not correctly parse the input. The original code is incorrect, and the provided corrected version of `func_2()` should be used instead.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **False**
