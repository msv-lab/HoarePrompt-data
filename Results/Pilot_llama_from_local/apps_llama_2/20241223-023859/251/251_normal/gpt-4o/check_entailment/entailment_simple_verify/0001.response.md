Based on the provided code, problem description, and annotated version, the original assessment of Correctness: **False** seems accurate. The issue lies in the way the input is read in the `func_2()` function.

The line `cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]` attempts to parse the input data directly from the first line, which only contains the number of cakes `n`. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be in the following format:

- The first line contains a single integer `n` (the number of cakes).
- Each of the following `n` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `h_i` (the radius and height of the `i-th` cake).

The original code does not follow this format, as it tries to read all the cake dimensions from the first line, which is incorrect.

The annotated version of the code does not provide a different perspective on this issue, as it still contains the same incorrect input parsing code. Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **False** is maintained.

The corrected version of the `func_2()` function, as provided in the original assessment, reads the input lines for the cakes' dimensions separately, which is the correct approach.

Final: **False**
