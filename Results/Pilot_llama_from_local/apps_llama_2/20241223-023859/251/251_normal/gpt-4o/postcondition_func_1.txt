Functionality: The function `func_2` reads input from the user, processes it into a list of cake dimensions, and then calls another function `func_1` with this data. It then prints the result of `func_1` to the console with six decimal places of precision. The input is expected to be in a specific format, starting with a positive integer `n` followed by `n` tuples of two positive integers each, representing the radius and height of a cake. If the input does not match this format, the function may fail or produce unexpected results. The function does not perform any validation on the input data, so it assumes that the user will provide correct and valid input. After the function concludes, the state of the program will include the printed result and any side effects from the execution of `func_1`, which are not specified in the given annotations. The original input variables `n` and `cakes` are not modified by `func_2` itself but are used to compute the result from `func_1`. The actual modification or usage of these variables depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
