The function calculates and returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes in a specific order, given the volumes of cakes with different radii and heights. The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` of pairs of positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes, considering that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if the volume of the cake below is less than the volume of the cake above. The function handles cases where cakes cannot be stacked, in which case it returns the volume of the cake with the largest volume. It also handles cases where the input list `cakes` has a length equal to `n`, ensuring that the function processes all cakes. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid, i.e., `n` is a positive integer and `cakes` is a list of pairs of positive integers with a length equal to `n`.
