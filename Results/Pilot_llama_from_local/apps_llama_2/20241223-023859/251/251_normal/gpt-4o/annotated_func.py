#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of pairs of positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake, such that the length of cakes is equal to n.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the variable dp
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes in a specific order, given the volumes of cakes with different radii and heights. The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` of pairs of positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function returns the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes, considering that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if the volume of the cake below is less than the volume of the cake above. The function handles cases where cakes cannot be stacked, in which case it returns the volume of the cake with the largest volume. It also handles cases where the input list `cakes` has a length equal to `n`, ensuring that the function processes all cakes. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid, i.e., `n` is a positive integer and `cakes` is a list of pairs of positive integers with a length equal to `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers, representing the radius and height of a cake.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` reads input from the user, processes it into a list of cake dimensions, and then calls another function `func_1` with this data. It then prints the result of `func_1` to the console with six decimal places of precision. The input is expected to be in a specific format, starting with a positive integer `n` followed by `n` tuples of two positive integers each, representing the radius and height of a cake. If the input does not match this format, the function may fail or produce unexpected results. The function does not perform any validation on the input data, so it assumes that the user will provide correct and valid input. After the function concludes, the state of the program will include the printed result and any side effects from the execution of `func_1`, which are not specified in the given annotations. The original input variables `n` and `cakes` are not modified by `func_2` itself but are used to compute the result from `func_1`. The actual modification or usage of these variables depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
