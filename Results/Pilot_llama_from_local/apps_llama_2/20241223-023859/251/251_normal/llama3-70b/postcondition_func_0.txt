The function reads input from the standard input, calculates the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked under certain conditions, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters, but instead relies on user input. The input is expected to be well-formed, starting with a positive integer n, followed by n lines, each containing two positive integers r_i and h_i. The function calculates the volume of each cake as Ï€ * r_i * r_i * h_i, sorts the cakes in descending order of volume, and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes with decreasing radius and height. The function handles edge cases such as n being 0, in which case it prints 0, or n being 1, in which case it prints the volume of the single cake. However, it does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will always be valid. The final state of the program is that it prints the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked and does not return any value.
