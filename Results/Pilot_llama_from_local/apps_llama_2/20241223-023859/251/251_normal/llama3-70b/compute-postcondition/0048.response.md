The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. The value of `i` is `n-1`, the value of `j` is 1, and the value of `cakes[i][0]` depends on the `i-th` tuple in the `cakes` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1` and at least 1, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements, `r` and `h` are defined, `dp` is a list with `dp[n-1]` defined and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[n-1][0]`, `j` is 1**
