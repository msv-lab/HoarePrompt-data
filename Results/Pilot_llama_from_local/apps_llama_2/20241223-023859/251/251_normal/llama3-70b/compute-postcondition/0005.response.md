According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. The loop variable `_` is used to ignore the loop variable, but it still increments at the end of each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, so for the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the current value of `_`. Since this is the second iteration, `_` is 1 (for the first iteration) and now it should be 2 for the second iteration to happen but since we are talking about the state for the next iteration of the loop, `_` will be 2 when the next iteration begins if `n` is greater than 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing one tuple element {(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)}, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
