Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1` and at least 1, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements, `r` and `h` are defined, `dp` is a list with `dp[n-1]` defined, `j` is 0. The current value of `i` and `j` are such that the height and radius of the cake at index `i` are less than the height and radius of the cake at index `j`, specifically, `cakes[i][1]` (height of cake `i`) is less than `cakes[j][1]` (height of cake `j`) and `cakes[i][2]` (radius of cake `i`) is less than `cakes[j][2]` (radius of cake `j`).**
