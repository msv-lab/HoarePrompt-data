Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1` and at least 1, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements, `r` and `h` are defined, `dp` is a list with `dp[n-1]` defined, `j` is 0, and if the height and radius of the cake at index `i` are less than the height and radius of the cake at index `j`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.**
