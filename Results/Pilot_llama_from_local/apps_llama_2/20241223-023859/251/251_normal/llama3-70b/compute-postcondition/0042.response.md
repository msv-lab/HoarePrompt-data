The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `cakes[i][0]`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `dp[n-1]` is now set to `cakes[n-1][0]`, which is the volume of the `(n-1)`th cake. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined, and `dp` is a list where `dp[n-1]` is the volume of the `(n-1)`th cake, specifically `cakes[n-1][0]`.**
