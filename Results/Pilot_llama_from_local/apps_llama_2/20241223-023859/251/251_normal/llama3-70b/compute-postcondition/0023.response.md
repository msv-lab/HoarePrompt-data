Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cakes` is a list of at least 3 tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[0][0] + cakes[1][0]`, `dp[2]` is `cakes[0][0] + cakes[1][0] + cakes[2][0]`, and the rest of `dp` are `0.0`. Otherwise, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, `dp[2]` is `cakes[0][0] + cakes[2][0]`, and the rest of `dp` are `0.0`, `j` is 0.**
