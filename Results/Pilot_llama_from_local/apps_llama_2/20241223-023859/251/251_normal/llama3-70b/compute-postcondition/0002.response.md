According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, this condition is met. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan on using later, so we don't need to track its state. The state of `cakes` as an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop. 

At the start of the loop, since we are using `range(n)`, the loop will execute `n` times. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is an empty list `[]`**
