Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n + 1` tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. If this condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
