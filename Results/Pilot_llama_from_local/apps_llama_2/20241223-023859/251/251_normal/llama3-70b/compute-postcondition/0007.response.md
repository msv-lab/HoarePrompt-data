The provided code appends a new tuple element to the `cakes` list, which is calculated using the formula `math.pi * r * r * h`. Given that `cakes` initially contains one tuple element with the same formula, the new element is essentially a duplicate of the existing one.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing two tuple elements {(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h), (math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)}, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
