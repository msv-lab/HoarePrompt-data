Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `n` from the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` for some `j` where `j` takes values from 0 to `n-1`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is equal to `max(cakes[i][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`.**
