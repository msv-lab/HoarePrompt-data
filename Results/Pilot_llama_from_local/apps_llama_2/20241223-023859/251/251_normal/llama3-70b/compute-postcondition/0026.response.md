Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cakes` is a list of at least 3 tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined, `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]`.***
