Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of at least 2 tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined, initially `dp[0]` was `cakes[0][0]`, initially `dp[1]` was `cakes[1][0]`, the rest of `dp` were `0.0`, `j` was 0, and given the current state: the current value of `i` is 1, the current value of `j` is 0, the current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][1]`, and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][2]`.**
