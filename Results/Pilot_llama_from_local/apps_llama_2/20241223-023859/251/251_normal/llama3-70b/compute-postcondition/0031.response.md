Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `n` from the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements sorted in descending order by volume, `r` and `h` are defined, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. The current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][2]`.**
