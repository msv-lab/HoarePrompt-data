Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1` and at least 1, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements, `r` and `h` are defined, `j` is 2. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp` is a list with `dp[n-1]` = `max(dp[n-1], dp[2] + cakes[n-1][0])`.***
