The values of `r` and `h` are updated to be input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2. The list `cakes` still contains two tuple elements, but now we can substitute `r` and `h` with the input integers in the tuple elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `cakes` is a list containing two tuple elements {(math.pi * input_r * input_r * input_h, input_r, input_h), (math.pi * input_r * input_r * input_h, input_r, input_h)}, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `cakes` is a list containing two tuple elements {(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h), (math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)}, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
