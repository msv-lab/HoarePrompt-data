Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1` and at least 1, `cakes` is a list of at least `n` tuple elements, `r` and `h` are defined, `dp` is a list with `dp[n-1]` defined, `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[n-1][0]`.**
