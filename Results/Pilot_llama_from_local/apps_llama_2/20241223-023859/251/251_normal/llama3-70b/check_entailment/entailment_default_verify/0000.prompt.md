You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. However, the given program sorts the cakes in descending order of their volumes before processing them. This means that the program may try to place a cake with a larger index on top of a cake with a smaller index, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, if we have two cakes with volumes 1000 and 2000, the program will first process the cake with volume 2000 and then the cake with volume 1000. At this point, the program will try to place the cake with volume 1000 on top of the cake with volume 2000, which is not allowed because the cake with volume 1000 has a larger index than the cake with volume 2000.

To fix this issue, the program should process the cakes in the order they are given in the input, without sorting them by volume. This will ensure that the program only tries to place a cake on top of a cake with a smaller index, as allowed by the problem description. 

Here's a simple case where the given program fails: 

Input:
```
3
10 10
5 5
20 20
```
In this case, the program will first process the cake with volume 3141.59 (20 20), then the cake with volume 785.398 (10 10), and finally the cake with volume 196.35 (5 5). The program will then try to place the cake with volume 196.35 on top of the cake with volume 785.398, and then it will try to place the cake with volume 785.398 on top of the cake with volume 3141.59, which is not allowed because the cake with volume 785.398 has a larger index than the cake with volume 196.35 in the original order. 

However, the optimal way to stack the cakes is to place the cake with volume 196.35 on the table, then place the cake with volume 785.398 on top of it, and finally place the cake with volume 3141.59 on top of it. The total volume of the stacked cakes is 3141.59 + 785.398 + 196.35 = 4123.328. 

But the program will output a different result, because it processes the cakes in the wrong order.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input from the standard input, calculates the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked under certain conditions, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters, but instead relies on user input. The input is expected to be well-formed, starting with a positive integer n, followed by n lines, each containing two positive integers r_i and h_i. The function calculates the volume of each cake as π * r_i * r_i * h_i, sorts the cakes in descending order of volume, and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes with decreasing radius and height. The function handles edge cases such as n being 0, in which case it prints 0, or n being 1, in which case it prints the volume of the single cake. However, it does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will always be valid. The final state of the program is that it prints the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked and does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
