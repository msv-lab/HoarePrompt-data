The given code calculates `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction offsets `dr` and `dc`. 

The values of `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions`, `visited` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code. 

`new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`. 

The Output State is: `queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str` will be calculated based on the next direction, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration.

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str` will be calculated based on the next direction, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration**
