To calculate the result, let's consider the given initial state and the provided code.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
Given that:
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`
- `dr` is 1
- `dc` is 0

Substituting these values into the code:
```python
new_row, new_col = (empty_pos // 2) + 1, (empty_pos % 2) + 0
```
Thus, `new_row` becomes `(empty_pos // 2) + 1` and `new_col` remains the same as `empty_pos % 2`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`)
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`
- `dr` is 1
- `dc` is 0
- `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`
- `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`**
