Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. The current values of `new_row` and `new_col` are such that `new_row` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 2, and `new_col` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 2.**
