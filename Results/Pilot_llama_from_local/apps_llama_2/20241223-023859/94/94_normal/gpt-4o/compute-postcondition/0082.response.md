The code calculates `new_row` and `new_col` based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

`new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`queue` still has one less element, 
`current` is still the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is still the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is still equal to `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` is still equal to `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`visited` still includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
`directions` still must have at least one direction, 
`dr` and `dc` are still set to the first direction in `directions`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`queue` has one less element, 
`current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
`directions` must have at least one direction, 
`dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least one direction, `dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`**
