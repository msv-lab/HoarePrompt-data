The code creates a new variable `new_state` and assigns it the value of `current` converted to a list. This operation does not change the values of `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `visited`, `directions`, `(dr, dc)`, `new_row`, `new_col`, or `new_pos`. 

The variable `new_state` is now a list that is a copy of `current`. 

Output State: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state` is a list equal to `current`.**
