According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `queue` is not specified. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty.

State: **`queue` must not be empty**
