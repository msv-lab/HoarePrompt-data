The given code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. 

`new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`, where `new_state` is a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The `queue` is not updated in this snippet, it is only updated based on whether the new state is within the boundaries and has not been visited before. The `visited` set is updated as the new state is added to it. 
All other variables keep their current values, hence:
`current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`directions` must have at least two directions, 
`dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
`new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`, 
`new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)` and `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue` including `new_state_str`.
Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue` including `new_state_str`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`.**
