The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends `new_state_str` to the end of `queue`. 

Given the initial state, `queue` had one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`, and `new_state_str` is present in the `visited` collection.

After the execution of the given code, `queue` now has the same number of elements as before, since we added one element (`new_state_str`) to it. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)` and is present in the `visited` collection, and the last element of `queue` is `new_state_str`**.
