According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions`. If `directions` has at least two directions, the loop can execute again for the next direction. At the end of the last iteration, `directions` must have at least two directions. For the loop to execute one more time, the next direction should be used, so `(dr, dc)` should be the next direction in `directions`.

However, the state adjustments also depend on the previous iteration's results. If `new_state_str` was added to `visited` and `queue` was updated, or if the state remained unchanged because `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` was not met, we should consider the next direction in `directions`.

Since `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue`, and we are considering the next iteration, `current` should still be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, unless `queue` was updated by removing the leftmost element. In that case, `current` should be the new leftmost element of `queue`.

However, we are given that `queue` has the same number of elements as before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and the position is within bounds, otherwise `queue` has one less element than before. So for the next iteration, `queue` should either have the same number of elements with a potentially new leftmost element if an update occurred, or one less element than before if no update occurred because `new_state_str` was not appended to `queue`.

`empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are derived from `current`, so if `current` changes because `queue` was updated, these variables should also be updated to reflect the new `current`. 

`new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str` are all dependent on the current direction and the state of `current`, so these will change as the loop iterates over `directions`.

`visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was appended during the last iteration, so it should remain unchanged at the start of the next iteration unless a new `new_state_str` is generated and appended.

State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated based on the next direction, `new_pos` will be calculated based on the next direction, `new_state` will be calculated based on the next direction, `new_state_str` will be calculated based on the next direction, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration**
