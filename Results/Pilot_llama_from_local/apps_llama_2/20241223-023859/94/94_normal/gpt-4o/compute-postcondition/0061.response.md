The given code snippet is `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)`. This line of code converts the list of characters `new_state` into a string `new_state_str`.

The impact of the code on the program is that it creates a new string variable `new_state_str` which is a string representation of the `new_state` list.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

The value of `new_state_str` is now equal to `''.join(new_state)`, which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, 
`current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, 
`directions` must have at least two directions, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
`new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and 
`new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.**
