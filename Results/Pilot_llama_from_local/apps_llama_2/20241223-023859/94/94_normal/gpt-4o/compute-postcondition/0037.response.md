Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` includes `new_state_str` and `visited` contains `new_state_str`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
