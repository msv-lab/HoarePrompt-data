To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to understand what the code does and how it affects the variables.

The given code snippet is:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle,
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is 1,
- `dc` is 0,
- `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`,
- `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,

The code calculates `new_pos` based on `new_row` and `new_col`. Since `new_row = (empty_pos // 2) + 1` and `new_col = empty_pos % 2`, we substitute these into the equation for `new_pos`:

`new_pos = ((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`

Given that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' and assuming a 2x2 grid where positions are indexed from 0 to 3 (top-left to bottom-right), if `empty_pos` is in the first row (0 or 1), `new_row` would be 1 (since we're moving down). If `empty_pos` is in the second row (2 or 3), `new_row` would attempt to move out of bounds.

However, the exact value of `new_pos` depends on the value of `empty_pos`. Let's consider the possible values of `empty_pos` and calculate `new_pos` accordingly:

1. If `empty_pos = 0`, then `new_row = 1`, `new_col = 0`, so `new_pos = 1*2 + 0 = 2`.
2. If `empty_pos = 1`, then `new_row = 1`, `new_col = 1`, so `new_pos = 1*2 + 1 = 3`.
3. If `empty_pos = 2`, then `new_row = 2`, `new_col = 0`, so `new_pos = 2*2 + 0 = 4`. However, this would be out of bounds for a 2x2 puzzle.
4. If `empty_pos = 3`, then `new_row = 2`, `new_col = 1`, so `new_pos = 2*2 + 1 = 5`. Again, this would be out of bounds.

The states of the other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, considering the calculation and potential out-of-bounds scenarios, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, and `new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`, potentially being out of bounds for the puzzle if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3.**
