The code removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to the `current` variable. This operation does not affect the `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, or `visited` variables. However, the `queue` is now one element shorter.

Output State: **The `queue` has one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the new `current` state, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, and `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`.**
