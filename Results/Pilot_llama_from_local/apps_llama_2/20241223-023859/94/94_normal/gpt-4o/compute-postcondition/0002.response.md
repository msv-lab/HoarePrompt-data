The code snippet provided defines a list of possible directions in a 2D grid, which can be used to navigate the sliding puzzle. The directions are represented as pairs of changes in the x and y coordinates.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', `queue` is a deque containing the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, `directions` is a list of tuples containing the possible directions in the puzzle, which are [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
