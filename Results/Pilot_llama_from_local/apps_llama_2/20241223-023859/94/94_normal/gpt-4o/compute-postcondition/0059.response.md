To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given code snippet does. The line `new_state = list(current)` converts the string `current` into a list of characters. This is because strings in Python are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed in-place, whereas lists are mutable, allowing for character swaps or other modifications that might be intended in the context of this code.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`.
- `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2.
- `directions` must have at least two directions.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

And the code:
```python
new_state = list(current)
```

This code introduces a new variable `new_state` which is a list representation of the string `current`. The rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged because this line of code does not affect them directly.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`.
- `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2.
- `directions` must have at least two directions.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
- `new_state` is a list of characters where each character is an element of the string `current`.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state` is a list of characters where each character is an element of the string `current`.**
