The given code removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `current`. Since the `queue` initially contains the `start` configuration, `current` will be equal to `start` after the execution of the code. The `queue` will be updated to exclude the `start` configuration.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, `directions` is a list of tuples containing the possible directions in the puzzle, which are [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], and `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration.**
