According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains all reachable states from the initial state, which implies that it might be empty after the last state was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty. 

State: **The `queue` is not empty, `current` is the last state processed from the `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the last `current` state, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, and `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`.**
