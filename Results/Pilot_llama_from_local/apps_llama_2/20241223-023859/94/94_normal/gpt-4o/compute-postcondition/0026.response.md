The value of `queue` is updated by appending `new_state_str` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The `start` configuration remains the same, `visited` remains unchanged as it already contains `new_state_str`, `directions` is still the same, `current` remains equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is still the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is still `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is still `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is still 1, `dc` is still 0, `new_row` is still `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is still `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` is still `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, `new_state` is still a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped compared to the `start` (or `current`) configuration, and `new_state_str` is still `''.join(new_state)`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and including `new_state_str`, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped compared to the `start` (or `current`) configuration, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.**
