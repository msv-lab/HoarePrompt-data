The given code changes the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Given that `dr` is 0 and `dc` is -1, we can calculate `new_row` and `new_col` as follows:

`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, which equals `empty_row + 0`, so `new_row` is `empty_row`.

`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, which equals `empty_col - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is 0, 
`dc` is -1, 
`new_row` is `empty_row`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col - 1`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`**
