To determine the output state, we should consider how the given code snippet affects the variables in the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
Given the initial state:
- `queue` has one less element than before,
- `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`,
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2,
- `directions` must have at least one direction.

The code calculates `new_row` and `new_col` based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. However, `dr` and `dc` are not defined in the given initial state, so we must assume they are defined elsewhere in the code and represent the changes in row and column, respectively, likely derived from the `directions`.

The impact of the code is the creation of two new variables, `new_row` and `new_col`, which are calculated as follows:
- `new_row` is the sum of `empty_row` and `dr`,
- `new_col` is the sum of `empty_col` and `dc`.

The states of `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and `directions` remain unchanged because the code does not modify these variables directly.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables from the initial state plus the new variables `new_row` and `new_col` with their calculated values.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
