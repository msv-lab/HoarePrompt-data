Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` also includes `new_state_str` and `visited` also includes `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped compared to the `start` (or `current`) configuration, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.***
