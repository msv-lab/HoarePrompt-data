The value of `new_state` is assigned as a list copy of `current`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`new_state` equals a list of values in `current`.
The queue, current, empty_pos, empty_row, empty_col, visited, directions, dr, dc, new_row, new_col, and new_pos remain unchanged.
Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` equals a list of values in `current`.**
