To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program's state.


Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is 0,
- `dc` is -1,
- `new_row` is `empty_row`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and
- `new_pos` is `empty_pos - 1`.


The code snippet provided is:
```python
new_state = list(current)
```


The impact of this code is the creation of a new variable `new_state`, which is a list representation of the string `current`. In Python, when you convert a string to a list using the `list()` function, each character of the string becomes an element of the list.


Therefore, `new_state` will be a list where each element corresponds to a character in the `current` configuration of the puzzle.


Since `current` equals the `start` configuration and `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of the puzzle, `new_state` will be a list version of this string.


The states of the other variables (`start`, `queue`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`) are not affected by this operation.


Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `empty_pos - 1`, and `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.**
