The given code creates a new string `new_state_str` by joining the elements of the `new_state` list. The `new_state` list is a modified version of the `current` configuration, where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

The `new_state_str` variable is assigned the value of the string representation of the `new_state` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, 
`visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is -1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of the `current` configuration with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, 
`new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`.

`new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of the `current` configuration with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, 
`new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`**
