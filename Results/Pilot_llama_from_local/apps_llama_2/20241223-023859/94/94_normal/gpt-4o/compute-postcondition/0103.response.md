According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If the list has at least one more direction (i.e., a tuple of `(dr, dc)`), the loop can execute again for the next direction. At the end of the last iteration, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `visited`, `directions`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col` are updated based on the last direction. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next direction in the `directions` list. This means we need to index into the `directions` list and get the next `(dr, dc)` tuple.

Let's assume the `directions` list has at least one more direction. Then, after the last iteration, we should move to the next direction. 

So, we adjust the states as follows: `(dr, dc)` should be the next direction in the list, and all other states remain unchanged.

State: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` and `new_col` are recalculated based on the new `dr` and `dc`.**
