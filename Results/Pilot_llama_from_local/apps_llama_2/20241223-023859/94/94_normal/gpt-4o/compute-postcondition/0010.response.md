To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration,
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is -1,
- `dc` is 0,
- The current value of `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`,
- The current value of `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.

Given this information, we are asked to calculate the impact of the following code:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

Substituting the expressions for `new_row` and `new_col` from the initial state into the equation:
```python
new_pos = ((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)
```

Simplifying the expression, we have:
```python
new_pos = (empty_pos - 2) + (empty_pos % 2)
```

Since `empty_pos` is an integer, we can simplify further:
```python
new_pos = empty_pos - 2 + (empty_pos % 2)
```

However, we must remember that the `new_row` and `new_col` values were calculated based on specific conditions and the fact that the new position is within the puzzle boundaries.

Considering the given boundaries (0 ≤ `new_row` < 2 and 0 ≤ `new_col` < 2), and given that `new_row` = `(empty_pos // 2) - 1` and `new_col` = `empty_pos % 2`, we conclude that the only configuration that satisfies these conditions when `new_row` and `new_col` are used to calculate `new_pos` is when `empty_pos` is such that moving up (given `dr` = -1 and `dc` = 0) from `empty_pos` results in a valid position within the puzzle.

The states of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not affected by this operation. Only `new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`, which in turn depend on `empty_pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, 
`visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is -1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
and `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, and `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`**
