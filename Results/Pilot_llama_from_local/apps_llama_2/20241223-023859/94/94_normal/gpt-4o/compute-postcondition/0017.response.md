Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding or including `new_state_str` depending on whether `new_state_str` was in `visited`, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if it was not already in `visited`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, `new_state` is a list representation of the `current` configuration with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, if `new_state_str` was not in `visited` then `queue` includes `new_state_str` and `visited` includes `new_state_str`.***
