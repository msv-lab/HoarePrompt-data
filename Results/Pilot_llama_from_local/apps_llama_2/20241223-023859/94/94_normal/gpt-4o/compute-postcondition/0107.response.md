The given Python code snippet swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. 

`new_state` is a list equal to `current`, and `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are calculated based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

After the code is executed, the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are swapped. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`queue` still has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, 
`current` remains the same, 
`empty_pos` remains the same, 
`empty_row` remains the same, 
`empty_col` remains the same, 
`visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, 
`directions` has at least one more direction, 
`(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, 
`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
and `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

Output State: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[empty_pos]`.**
