The given code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The value of `new_state_str` is a string representation of the `new_state` list, which is derived from the previous state with the positions of the empty space and the adjacent space in the direction `(dr, dc)` swapped.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. The `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` remains the same, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)`.

The impact of the code is that `queue` now has one more element, which is the `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is the previous `new_state_str` if the previous `new_state_str` was not in `visited` plus the new `new_state_str`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes the previous `new_state_str`, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)`.**
