The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` assigns a new value to `new_pos`. The value of `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and the value of `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. 

So, `new_pos` is assigned the value `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
