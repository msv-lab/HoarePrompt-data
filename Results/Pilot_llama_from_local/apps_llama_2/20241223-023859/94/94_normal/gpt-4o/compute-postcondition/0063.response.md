The code appends `new_state_str` to `queue`. Given the initial state conditions, `queue` will have `new_state_str` appended to it because `new_state_str` is in `visited` is not considered in this code snippet, but the conditions `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2` are still valid. 

Therefore, `queue` now has one more element, which is `new_state_str`. The other variables (`current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, and `visited`) maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`queue` has `new_state_str` appended to it, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`**
