The given code snippet swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. This affects the `new_state` variable, which is a list representation of the `current` configuration.

Since `new_pos` is `empty_pos - 1`, this operation essentially moves the 'X' (represented by `empty_pos`) one position to the left in the `new_state` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the `start` configuration remains the same, `queue` remains unchanged, `directions` remains the same, `current` remains equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` remains the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` remains `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` remains `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` remains 0, `dc` remains -1, `new_row` remains `empty_row`, and `new_col` remains `empty_col - 1`.

However, it's worth noting that `new_state` now represents a new configuration after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. 

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and `new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`.**
