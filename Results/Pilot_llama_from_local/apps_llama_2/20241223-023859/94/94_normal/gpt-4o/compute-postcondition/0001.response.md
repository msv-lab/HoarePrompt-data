The code creates a new set called `visited` and initializes it with the `start` configuration. 

The value of `start` is still a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The `queue` is still a deque containing the `start` configuration. A new set `visited` is created and it contains the `start` configuration.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', `queue` is a deque containing the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration**
