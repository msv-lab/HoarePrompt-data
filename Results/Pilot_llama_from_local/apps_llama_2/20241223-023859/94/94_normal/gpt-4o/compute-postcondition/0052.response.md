The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the `visited` collection. The value of `new_state_str` is not present in the `visited` collection before this operation. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`. The current value of `new_state_str` is now present in the `visited` collection.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`, and `new_state_str` is present in the `visited` collection**
