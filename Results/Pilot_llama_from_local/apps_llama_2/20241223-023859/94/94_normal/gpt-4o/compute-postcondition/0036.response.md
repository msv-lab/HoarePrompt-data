The given code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are still valid, but `queue` now contains an additional configuration `new_state_str`. 

`start` is still a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle. 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration. 
`directions` is still [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is 0, 
`dc` is -1, 
`new_row` is `empty_row`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`, 
`new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, 
`visited` contains `new_state_str`, 
and `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and now also including `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and including `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and `visited` contains `new_state_str`**
