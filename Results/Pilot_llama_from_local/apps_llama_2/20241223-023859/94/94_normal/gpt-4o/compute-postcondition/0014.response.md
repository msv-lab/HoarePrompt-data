Postcondition: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, 
`visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is -1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of the `current` configuration with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, 
`new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and the current value of `new_state_str` is not in the `visited` set**
