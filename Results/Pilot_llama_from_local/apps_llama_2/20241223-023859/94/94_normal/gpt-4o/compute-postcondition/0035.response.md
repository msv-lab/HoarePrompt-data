To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. 

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is 0,
- `dc` is -1,
- `new_row` is `empty_row`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`,
- `new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`,
- `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.

The code affects the `visited` set by adding `new_state_str` to it. Other variables and their states remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies the `visited` set.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_state` is a list representation of `current` after swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos - 1]`, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and `visited` contains `new_state_str`**
