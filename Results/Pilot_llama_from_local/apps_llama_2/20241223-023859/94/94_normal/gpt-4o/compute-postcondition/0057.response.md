The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.

Given the initial state, we know that `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. However, the initial values of `dr` and `dc` are not specified, which means they can be any integer values.

After executing the code, the values of `new_row` and `new_col` become `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively.

The states of the other variables (`queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
