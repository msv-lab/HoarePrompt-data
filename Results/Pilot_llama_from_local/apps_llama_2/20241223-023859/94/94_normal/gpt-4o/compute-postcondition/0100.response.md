The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. 

Given the initial state, `queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before. 

Now, since `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`, it means `new_state_str` is a valid new state (within boundaries and not visited before). 

So, the `queue` now has one more element which is `new_state_str`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element which is `new_state_str`, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue` including `new_state_str`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`**
