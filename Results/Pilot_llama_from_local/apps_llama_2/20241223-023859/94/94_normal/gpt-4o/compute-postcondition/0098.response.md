The given code snippet is `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)`. 

The impact of this code on the program is that it converts the list `new_state` into a string `new_state_str`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are: 
- `new_state` is a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.
- The other variables are not affected by this code.

The result of the code is that `new_state_str` becomes a string where each character is an element from the `new_state` list.

The output state is: 
- `queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, 
- `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
- `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
- `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
- `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
- `directions` must have at least two directions, 
- `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, 
- `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
- `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
- `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
- `new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`, 
- `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)` which is a string representation of `new_state`.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, 
`current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
`directions` must have at least two directions, 
`dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
`new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`, 
`new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`**
