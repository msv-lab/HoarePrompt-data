To calculate the output state, we should analyze how the given code snippet affects the variables and their values.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration,
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is -1,
- `dc` is 0,
- `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`,
- `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`,

And the code:
```python
new_state = list(current)
```

This code converts the string `current` into a list and assigns it to `new_state`. 

Since `current` equals `start`, `new_state` will be a list representation of the initial configuration of the puzzle.

The code does not modify any of the existing variables; it only introduces a new variable `new_state`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, 
`visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is -1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) - 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of the `current` configuration.**
