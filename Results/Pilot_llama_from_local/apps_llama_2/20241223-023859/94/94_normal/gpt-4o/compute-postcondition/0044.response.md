According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If `directions` has at least one direction (i.e., one pair of `(dr, dc)`), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, and `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2. For the loop to execute, `directions` must have at least one direction.

State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction**
