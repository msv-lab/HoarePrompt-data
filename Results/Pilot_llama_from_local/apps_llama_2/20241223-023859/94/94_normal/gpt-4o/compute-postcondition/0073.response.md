The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are not changed, except for the `queue` which now has one more element than before. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one more element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have swapped their values, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and `visited` includes `new_state_str` in addition to any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have swapped their values, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and `visited` includes `new_state_str` in addition to any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration, and the last element of `queue` is `new_state_str`.**
