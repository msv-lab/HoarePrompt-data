The given code creates a new list `new_state` which is a copy of the string `current`. 

`new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, where `current` is a string and is the former leftmost element of `queue`. This means `new_state` is now a list of characters, where each character is an element of the string `current`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` is a list of characters where each character is an element of the string `current`.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` is a list of characters where each character is an element of the string `current`**
