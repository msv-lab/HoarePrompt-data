The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. 

`queue` initially has one less element, and now it includes `new_state_str`. 
The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`queue` includes `new_state_str` and has one more element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, including `new_state_str`, `directions` must have at least one direction, `dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` equals the previous value at `new_pos` and `new_state[new_pos]` equals 'X', and `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`**
