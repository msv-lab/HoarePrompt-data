Postcondition: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, the current value of `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) - 1`, the current value of `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. The new position calculated is within the puzzle boundaries, specifically 0 is less than or equal to `new_row` and `new_row` is less than 2, and 0 is less than or equal to `new_col` and `new_col` is less than 2.**
