The given code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. The new values of `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated by adding `dr` to `empty_row` and `dc` to `empty_col` respectively. 

`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, where `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2` and `dr` is set to the second direction in `directions`. 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, where `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2` and `dc` is set to the second direction in `directions`.

The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`**
