The given code swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state`. This means that `new_state[empty_pos]` will now hold the value that was previously at `new_state[new_pos]`, and `new_state[new_pos]` will hold the value that was previously at `new_state[empty_pos]`.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`.**
