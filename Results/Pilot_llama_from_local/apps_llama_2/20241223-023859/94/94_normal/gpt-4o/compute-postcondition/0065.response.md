Postcondition: ***`queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `visited` includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
