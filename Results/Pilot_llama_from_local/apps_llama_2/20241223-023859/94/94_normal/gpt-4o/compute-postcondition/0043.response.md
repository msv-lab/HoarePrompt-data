The code calculates the row and column of the empty position in a 2x2 grid, where the empty position is given by `empty_pos`. 

`empty_row` is assigned the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2, which represents the row index of the empty position. 
`empty_col` is assigned the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, which represents the column index of the empty position.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2**
