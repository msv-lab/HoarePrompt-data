According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If the list has at least one more direction, the loop executes again for the next direction. At the end of the last iteration, `directions` has at least one direction. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `directions` must have at least one more direction.

State: **`queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`**
