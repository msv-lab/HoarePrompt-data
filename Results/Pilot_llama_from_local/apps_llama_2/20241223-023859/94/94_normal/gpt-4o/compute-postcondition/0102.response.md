Postcondition: ***`queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `visited`, `directions`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col` are updated according to their initial states, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `queue` has one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, otherwise it remains with the same elements, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged***
