The provided code snippet is `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)`. This line of code concatenates all the characters in the `new_state` list into a single string, which is then assigned to the variable `new_state_str`.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before
- `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2
- `directions` must have at least one direction left
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`)
- `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have swapped their values
- `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration

The code snippet `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` impacts the program by creating a string representation of the `new_state` list. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables except for assigning a new value to `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have swapped their values, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration**
