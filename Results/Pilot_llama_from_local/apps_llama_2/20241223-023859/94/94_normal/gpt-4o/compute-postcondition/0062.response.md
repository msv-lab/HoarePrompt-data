The code line `visited.add(new_state_str)` impacts the `visited` set by adding `new_state_str` to it. 

The `visited` set now includes `new_state_str`, which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped. 

All other variables remain unchanged, so `queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`. 

`current` is still the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, 

`empty_pos` is still the index of 'X' in `current`, 

`empty_row` is still `empty_pos` // 2, 

`empty_col` is still `empty_pos` % 2, 

`directions` must have at least two directions, 

`new_row` is still `empty_row + dr`, 

`new_col` is still `empty_col + dc`, 

`new_pos` is still `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 

`new_state` is still a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and 

`new_state_str` is still `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, otherwise `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `new_state_str` appended to it if `0 <= empty_row + dr < 2` and `0 <= empty_col + dc < 2`, `current` is the former leftmost element of the previous `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least two directions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list of characters where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` which is a string where the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`**.
