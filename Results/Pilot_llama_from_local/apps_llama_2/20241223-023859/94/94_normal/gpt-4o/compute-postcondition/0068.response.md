The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates the new position based on the new row and column. 

`new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row` multiplied by 2 plus `new_col`. 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. 
So, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state`, `new_state_str` will be calculated based on the next direction, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration**
