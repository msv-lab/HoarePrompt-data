To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set.

The initial state is:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle,
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is 1,
- `dc` is 0,
- `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`,
- `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`,
- `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped compared to the `start` (or `current`) configuration,
- `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.

Given the code `visited.add(new_state_str)`, the only change is that `new_state_str` is added to the `visited` set.

The output state is:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle,
- `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle,
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and `new_state_str`,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration,
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`),
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `dr` is 1,
- `dc` is 0,
- `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`,
- `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`,
- `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)`,
- `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped compared to the `start` (or `current`) configuration,
- `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.
