The code snippet `empty_pos = current.index('X')` assigns the index of the character 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. The value of `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration, `directions` is a list of tuples containing the possible directions in the puzzle, which are [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, and `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`)**
