`new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swap their values. The states of the other variables are not affected. The values of `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `directions`, `queue`, `current`, and `visited` are preserved, but `new_state` is updated by swapping the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. 

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as before or one less element than before, `current` is either the same as before or the new leftmost element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction left, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have swapped their values, `new_state_str` will be calculated based on the next direction, and `visited` includes any `new_state_str` that was appended during the previous iteration**
