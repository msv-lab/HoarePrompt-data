To determine the output state, we first analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element.
- `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`.
- `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`.
- `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`.
- `directions` must have at least two directions.
- `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`.
- `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`.

And the given code:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

This code calculates the new position `new_pos` based on `new_row` and `new_col`, which are derived from moving the 'X' in the `current` state according to the second direction in `directions`.

The calculation of `new_pos` is as follows:
- `new_row` is calculated by adding the row change `dr` (from the second direction in `directions`) to `empty_row`.
- `new_col` is calculated by adding the column change `dc` (from the second direction in `directions`) to `empty_col`.
- `new_pos` is then calculated by multiplying `new_row` by 2 (since each row has 2 columns in this context) and adding `new_col`.

Since the given code only introduces a new variable `new_pos` without altering any of the existing variables or their relationships, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new variable `new_pos`.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
