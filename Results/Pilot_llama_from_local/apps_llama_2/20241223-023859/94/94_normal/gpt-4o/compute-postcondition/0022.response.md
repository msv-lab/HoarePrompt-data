The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the `current` configuration. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`new_state` is equal to a list representation of the string `current`, which is initially equal to `start`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, 
`queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, 
`visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`dr` is 1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
`new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`, 
`new_state` is a list representation of `current`, which is equal to `list(start)`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration and possibly including `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the `start` configuration and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the puzzle, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `(empty_pos // 2) + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`, `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, which is equal to `list(start)`.**
