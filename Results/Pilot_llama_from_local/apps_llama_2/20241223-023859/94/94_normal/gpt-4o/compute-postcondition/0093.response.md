According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions`. If `directions` has at least two directions, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `directions` must have at least one direction, `dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `directions` must have at least two directions and `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`.
State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least two directions, `dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`**
