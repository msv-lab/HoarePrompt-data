The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` calculates the new row and column based on the current empty row, empty column, and the next direction in the list.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`
- `current` remains the same
- `empty_pos` remains the same
- `empty_row` remains the same
- `empty_col` remains the same
- `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged
- `directions` has at least one more direction
- `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list
- `new_row` and `new_col` are recalculated based on the new `dr` and `dc`

The new values of `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated as follows:
- `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`

So, the Output State is: 
`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, 
`current` remains the same, 
`empty_pos` remains the same, 
`empty_row` remains the same, 
`empty_col` remains the same, 
`visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, 
`directions` has at least one more direction, 
`(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, 
`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.

Output State: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already included and `new_state_str` is a valid new state, otherwise `visited` remains unchanged, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
