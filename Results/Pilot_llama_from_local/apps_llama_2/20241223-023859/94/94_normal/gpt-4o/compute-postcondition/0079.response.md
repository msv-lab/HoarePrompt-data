The code statement `empty_pos = current.index('X')` calculates the index of the character 'X' in the string `current` and assigns it to the variable `empty_pos`. 

Since `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2 and `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, and the fact that these values are calculated based on `empty_pos`, the new values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` would be the integer division of the index of 'X' in `current` by 2 and the modulus of the index of 'X' in `current` by 2 respectively.

Output State: **The `queue` has one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2 which equals to `current.index('X')` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2 which equals to `current.index('X')` % 2, and `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`.**
