The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates the new position based on the new row and column. The current values of `new_row` and `new_col` are such that `new_row` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 2, and `new_col` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 2. 

Given these conditions, the possible values for `new_row` are 0 and 1, and the possible values for `new_col` are 0 and 1. 

The new position `new_pos` is assigned the value `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which means `new_pos` can have the following possible values:
- When `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, `new_pos` is 0.
- When `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 1.
- When `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, `new_pos` is 2.
- When `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than before, `current` is the former leftmost element of `queue` and is a string, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` must have at least one direction, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`**
