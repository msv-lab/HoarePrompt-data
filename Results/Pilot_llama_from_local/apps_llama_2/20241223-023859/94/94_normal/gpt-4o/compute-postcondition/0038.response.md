Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing configurations excluding the `start` configuration, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the initial `start` configuration, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start` (or `current`), `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then a new state is created by swapping the empty position with the position to its left, and if this new state has not been visited, it is added to the queue and marked as visited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
