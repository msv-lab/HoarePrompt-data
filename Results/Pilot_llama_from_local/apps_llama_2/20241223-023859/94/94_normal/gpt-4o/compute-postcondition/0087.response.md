The given Python code snippet is: 
```
new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
```
This line of code converts the `new_state` list into a string and assigns it to the variable `new_state_str`. 

Given the initial state, we know that `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` equals the previous value at `new_pos` and `new_state[new_pos]` equals 'X', which was the previous value at `empty_pos`.

The impact of this code on the program is that it creates a new string variable `new_state_str` that represents the `new_state` list as a string.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`queue` has one less element, 
`current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
`directions` must have at least one direction, 
`dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
`new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` equals the previous value at `new_pos` and `new_state[new_pos]` equals 'X', 
and `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`.


Output State: **`queue` has one less element, `current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, `empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, `visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, `directions` must have at least one direction, `dr` and `dc` are set to the first direction in `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` equals the previous value at `new_pos` and `new_state[new_pos]` equals 'X', and `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`**
