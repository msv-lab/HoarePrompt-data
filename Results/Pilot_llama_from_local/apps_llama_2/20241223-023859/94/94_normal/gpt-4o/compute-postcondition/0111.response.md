Postcondition: **`queue` has the same elements or one more element which is the previous `new_state_str` if the previous `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, or it has one more element which is the new `new_state_str` if the new `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` remains the same, `empty_pos` remains the same, `empty_row` remains the same, `empty_col` remains the same, `visited` includes the previous `new_state_str` if it was not already included, `directions` has at least one more direction, `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in the list, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is equal to the old `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)`, which is a string representation of the `new_state` list, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` and `visited` are updated with the new `new_state_str`.**
