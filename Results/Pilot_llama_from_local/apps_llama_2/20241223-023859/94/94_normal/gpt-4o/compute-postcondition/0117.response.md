Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', and returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle, where each state is represented as a string. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible configurations of the puzzle by moving the 'X' tile in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and returns the set of all visited states. The function assumes that the input string `start` is a valid initial configuration of the puzzle and does not perform any error checking. If the input string is invalid (e.g., it does not contain exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'), the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, and the `start` parameter remains unchanged.**
