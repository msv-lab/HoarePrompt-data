The given code snippet swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. 

The new_state is initially a list of values in `current`. After the swap, `new_state[empty_pos]` becomes the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` becomes the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element, 
`current` is the first state from the previous `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `current.index('X') // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `current.index('X') % 2`, 
`visited` includes all unique states that have been generated and added to the `queue`, 
`directions` must have at least two directions, 
`dr` and `dc` are set to the second direction in `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
`new_state` equals a list of values in `current` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the new state generated by moving 'X' in the current state according to the second direction in `directions` is within the boundaries and has not been visited before, otherwise it remains with one less element,
