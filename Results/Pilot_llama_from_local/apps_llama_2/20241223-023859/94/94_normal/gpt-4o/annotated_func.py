#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing a 2 × 2 grid puzzle configuration.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns a 4-character string containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' in some order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2x2 puzzle configuration as a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns a 4-character string containing these characters in some order. The function does not modify the input puzzle configuration and simply concatenates the two input strings into a single string. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as input validation or error handling, and assumes that the input will always be a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing only the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. After the function concludes, the input puzzle configuration remains unchanged, and the returned 4-character string contains the same characters as the input puzzle configuration, but in a different order.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all unique reachable states from the initial state, `current` is the last state processed from the `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the last `current` state, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` remains unchanged, and `start` is the original initial configuration of the puzzle
    return visited
    #The program returns `visited`, which contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', and returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle, where each state is represented as a string. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible configurations of the puzzle by moving the 'X' tile in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and returns the set of all visited states. The function assumes that the input string `start` is a valid initial configuration of the puzzle and does not perform any error checking. If the input string is invalid (e.g., it does not contain exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'), the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, and the `start` parameter remains unchanged.
