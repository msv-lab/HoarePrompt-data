The function accepts a 2x2 puzzle configuration as a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns a 4-character string containing these characters in some order. The function does not modify the input puzzle configuration and simply concatenates the two input strings into a single string. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as input validation or error handling, and assumes that the input will always be a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing only the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. After the function concludes, the input puzzle configuration remains unchanged, and the returned 4-character string contains the same characters as the input puzzle configuration, but in a different order.
