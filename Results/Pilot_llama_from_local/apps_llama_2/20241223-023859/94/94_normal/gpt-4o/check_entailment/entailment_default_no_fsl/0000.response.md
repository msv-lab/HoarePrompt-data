Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem lies in the way the code checks if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. 

In the given code, the `func_2` function generates all possible reachable states from the initial state of the puzzle, and then the code checks if there is an intersection between the reachable states of Bessie's puzzle and Elsie's puzzle. However, this is not the correct condition to check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

The correct condition should be to check if there is a common state between the reachable states of Bessie's puzzle and Elsie's puzzle. But the code is checking if the intersection of the two sets of reachable states is not empty. 

However, the main issue with the code is in the line where it checks if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The code uses the bitwise AND operator (&) instead of checking if the intersection of the two sets is not empty.

A correct way to check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration would be to check if the intersection of the two sets of reachable states is not empty. This can be done using the `isdisjoint` method of the set data type in Python, which returns `True` if two sets have a null intersection.

Here is an example of how to correctly check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration:
```python
if not bessie_reachable.isdisjoint(elsie_reachable):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
Or equivalently:
```python
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
