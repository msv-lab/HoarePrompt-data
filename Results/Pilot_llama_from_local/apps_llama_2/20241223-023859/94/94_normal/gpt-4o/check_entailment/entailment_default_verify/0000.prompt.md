You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

#Function 2:
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given code's correctness in solving the puzzle problem, we need to understand if it successfully determines whether two given 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through any sequence of moves.

The provided code snippet includes a part of the solution but lacks the final function that directly compares the reachable configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. However, it gives a foundation with `func_2`, which generates all possible configurations reachable from a given puzzle state.

Given the definition of `func_2`, which uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible moves from a given starting configuration, we can infer that if Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same configuration, `func_2` applied to both of their puzzles should yield at least one common configuration.

However, the code snippet is incomplete as it does not directly compare the configurations reachable by Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. To assess its correctness, we'll consider what's missing and how it might affect the outcome.

1. **Missing Configuration Comparison**: The code does not include a function or part that compares the reachable configurations from both Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles directly. This comparison is crucial for determining if they can reach the same configuration.

2. **Reaching the Same Configuration**: Without the direct comparison, we can't conclude if the code can correctly identify when Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same configuration.

3. **Potential Cases Not Handled**: Without the complete implementation, it's challenging to pinpoint specific cases that might not be handled correctly. However, the BFS approach suggests that if implemented correctly, it should cover all reachable configurations for both puzzles.

Given the provided code snippet, it appears to lack the final step of comparing the reachable states of both puzzles. Therefore, without the complete implementation, the code as presented is incomplete and cannot be deemed fully correct for solving the problem as described.

However, based on the given snippet alone and the requirement to strictly follow the format without assuming additional parts of the code not provided, the evaluation regarding its correctness in handling all potential cases is limited.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not include the necessary function or logic to directly compare the reachable configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, which is crucial for determining if they can reach the same configuration. Without this comparison, the code cannot correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string parameter `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', and returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle, where each state is represented as a string. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible configurations of the puzzle by moving the 'X' tile in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and returns the set of all visited states. The function assumes that the input string `start` is a valid initial configuration of the puzzle and does not perform any error checking. If the input string is invalid (e.g., it does not contain exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'), the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, and the `start` parameter remains unchanged.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
