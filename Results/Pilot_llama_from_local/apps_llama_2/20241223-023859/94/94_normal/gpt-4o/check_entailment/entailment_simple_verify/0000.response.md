The original assessment deems the program incorrect due to the lack of a direct comparison between the reachable configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. However, the annotated version of the code reveals that this comparison is indeed made with the line `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:`. This line checks for the intersection of the sets `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`, which contain all unique reachable states from Bessie's and Elsie's initial puzzle configurations, respectively.

Given this information, the original assessment's reasoning is no longer accurate. The annotated code provides a complete implementation that includes the comparison of reachable states, which is crucial for determining if Bessie and Elsie can reach the same configuration.

The program first converts the input configurations into strings using `func_1`. Then, it uses `func_2` to generate all reachable configurations for both Bessie and Elsie. Finally, it checks if there's an intersection between the sets of reachable configurations, which indicates if there's a common configuration that both puzzles can reach.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the provided problem description, the program appears to be correct in determining whether Bessie and Elsie can reach the same configuration with their puzzles.

Final: **True**
