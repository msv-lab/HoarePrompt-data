You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing a 2 × 2 grid puzzle configuration.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns a 4-character string containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' in some order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2x2 puzzle configuration as a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns a 4-character string containing these characters in some order. The function does not modify the input puzzle configuration and simply concatenates the two input strings into a single string. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as input validation or error handling, and assumes that the input will always be a list of two strings, each of length 2, containing only the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. After the function concludes, the input puzzle configuration remains unchanged, and the returned 4-character string contains the same characters as the input puzzle configuration, but in a different order.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        
        empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all unique reachable states from the initial state, `current` is the last state processed from the `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the last `current` state, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `directions` remains unchanged, and `start` is the original initial configuration of the puzzle
    return visited
    #The program returns `visited`, which contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle with exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C', and returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start` of the puzzle, where each state is represented as a string. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible configurations of the puzzle by moving the 'X' tile in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and returns the set of all visited states. The function assumes that the input string `start` is a valid initial configuration of the puzzle and does not perform any error checking. If the input string is invalid (e.g., it does not contain exactly one 'X' and one each of the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'), the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, and the `start` parameter remains unchanged.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
