According to the code, the loop will execute 4 times, regardless of the state of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. The loop depends only on the range of `i`, which is 4. So, `i` must be 0 for the loop to start executing.
State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 0**
