Postcondition: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 1, if the first element of `puzzle1` is 'X' then `x1` is 0, and if `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X', then `x1` is 1, otherwise `x1` remains unchanged, and the current value of `puzzle2` at index `i` is either 'X' with `x2` being 0, or it is not 'X'**.
