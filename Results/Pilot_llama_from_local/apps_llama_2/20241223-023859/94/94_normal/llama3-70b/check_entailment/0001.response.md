Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in certain cases. The main issue is with the function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)`. This function attempts to check if it's possible to transform `puzzle1` into `puzzle2` by swapping the positions of 'X' in both puzzles and then checking if the sorted versions of the puzzles are equal.

However, this approach is flawed. The problem description states that two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. The function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)` does not accurately check for this condition.

A counterexample is when `puzzle1` is 'ABXC' and `puzzle2` is 'BAXC'. In this case, the function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)` will swap the positions of 'X' in both puzzles, resulting in 'ABXC' and 'BAXC', and then check if the sorted versions are equal, which they are. However, the original puzzles 'ABXC' and 'BAXC' are not in the same configuration, because the tile 'A' is in the first position in `puzzle1` but in the second position in `puzzle2`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex approach would be needed, possibly involving a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the puzzles.

Here's an example of how the function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)` could be modified to use a BFS algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    queue = deque([puzzle1])
    visited = set([puzzle1])
    
    while queue:
        current_puzzle = queue.popleft()
        if current_puzzle == puzzle2:
            return True
        
        # Generate all possible next puzzles
        for i in range(4):
            if current_puzzle[i] == 'X':
                # Check all adjacent positions
                for j in range(4):
                    if abs(i // 2 - j // 2) + abs(i % 2 - j % 2) == 1:
                        # Swap the 'X' with the adjacent tile
                        next_puzzle = list(current_puzzle)
                        next_puzzle[i], next_puzzle[j] = next_puzzle[j], next_puzzle[i]
                        next_puzzle = ''.join(next_puzzle)
                        if next_puzzle not in visited:
                            queue.append(next_puzzle)
                            visited.add(next_puzzle)
    
    return False
```

This modified function uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the puzzle, and checks if the target puzzle can be reached from the initial puzzle.
