Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The line of code `(puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])` is unnecessary and can cause incorrect results. This line of code is trying to swap the positions of the empty cells in the two puzzles, but this is not a valid move in the sliding puzzle.

Moreover, the function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)` is checking if the sorted lists of characters in the two puzzles are equal, which is not the correct condition to check if two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

A correct solution would involve using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the puzzles and check if there exists a sequence of moves that takes both puzzles to the same configuration.

For example, if the input is:
```
AB
XC
AC
XB
```
The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because Bessie can slide her 'A' tile down to reach the same configuration as Elsie's puzzle.

A correct implementation of the function would involve generating all possible next configurations of the puzzle by sliding the tiles adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell, and then checking if any of these configurations match the configuration of the other puzzle. This would require a significantly more complex implementation than the provided code.
