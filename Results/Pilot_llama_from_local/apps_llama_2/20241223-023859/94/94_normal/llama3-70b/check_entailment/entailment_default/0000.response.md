Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine if two 2x2 sliding puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration through a sequence of valid moves. The code simply swaps the positions of the 'X' elements between the two puzzles and checks if the sorted lists of the puzzles are equal after the swap. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration.

A correct solution would involve using a search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), to explore all possible configurations of the puzzles and check if there exists a sequence of valid moves that takes both puzzles to the same configuration.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
The code will return 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO', because there is no sequence of valid moves that can transform both puzzles into the same configuration.

The code also has several other issues, such as not handling edge cases where the input puzzles are not valid, and not checking if the 'X' elements exist in the puzzles before attempting to swap them. However, the main issue is that the approach used is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.
