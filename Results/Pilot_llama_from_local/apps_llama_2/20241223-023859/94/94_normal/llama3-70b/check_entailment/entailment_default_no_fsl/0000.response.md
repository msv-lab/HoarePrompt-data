Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem is to determine if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through a sequence of moves. The code only checks if the sorted lists of tiles in the two puzzles are equal after swapping the 'X' elements, which is not a sufficient condition for the puzzles to be able to reach the same configuration.

The problem description allows for rotations and reflections to be excluded, meaning that the order of tiles in the puzzles matters. However, the code ignores this by sorting the lists of tiles before comparing them.

A counterexample to the code can be found in the second example given in the problem description:

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

The code will incorrectly return 'YES' because the sorted lists of tiles will be equal after swapping the 'X' elements. However, the problem description states that the correct output for this example should be 'NO', because the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration.

This case shows that the code does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
