Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1. The function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)` swaps the 'X' elements between the two puzzles, which is not a valid move according to the problem description. The problem description states that a move involves sliding a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell, but the function does not check for adjacency.

2. The function checks if the sorted lists of the puzzles are equal after the swap, which is not the correct condition for determining if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The problem description requires that the tiles be in the same position on the grid, not just that the sets of tiles be the same.

3. The function does not perform any actual search for a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration. It simply swaps the 'X' elements and checks if the sorted lists are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to perform a search for a sequence of valid moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration, such as using a breadth-first search or depth-first search algorithm. The program would need to generate all possible next states of the puzzle after each move, and then check if the resulting state is the same as the target configuration. 

The given program does not meet the problem description and does not provide a correct solution to the problem.
