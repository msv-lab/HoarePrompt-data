Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input, which consists of a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers `a`.
2. The list `a` is then sorted in ascending order.
3. The program initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum excluded positive integer in the list `a`.
4. The program then iterates over the sorted list `a`. For each number `num` in `a`, it checks if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. If it is, it increments `mex` by 1.
5. After the loop finishes, the variable `mex` represents the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

This program works because it effectively "skips" over any numbers in the list that are already greater than or equal to the current `mex`, which is the smallest number that has not been seen yet. This simulates the effect of Alyona decreasing numbers in the list to make way for smaller numbers, effectively maximizing the mex value.

For example, given the input `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the program will iterate over the sorted list `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`. It will see the number 1, which is equal to `mex`, so it will increment `mex` to 2. Then it will see the numbers 3, 3, 3, which are all greater than `mex`, so it will increment `mex` to 4 and then to 5. Therefore, the maximum possible value of mex for this input is 5, which is the correct output.

Similarly, given the input `[2, 1]`, the program will iterate over the sorted list `[1, 2]`. It will see the number 1, which is equal to `mex`, so it will increment `mex` to 2. Then it will see the number 2, which is equal to `mex`, so it will increment `mex` to 3. Therefore, the maximum possible value of mex for this input is 3, which is the correct output.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
