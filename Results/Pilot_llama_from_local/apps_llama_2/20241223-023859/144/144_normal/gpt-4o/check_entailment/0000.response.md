Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to calculate the maximum possible MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value that can be achieved by modifying the elements of the input array. The MEX of an array is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

Here's how the program works:
1. It first reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
2. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
3. It initializes the `mex` variable to 1, which represents the smallest positive integer that we are currently checking.
4. It iterates over the sorted array `a`. For each element `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than or equal to the current `mex`.
5. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments the `mex` by 1. This is because we have found a number that is at least as large as the current `mex`, so we can potentially achieve a MEX of `mex + 1` by modifying the numbers in the array.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum possible MEX value, which is the final value of the `mex` variable.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for maximizing the MEX value. By sorting the array and iterating over it, it checks for the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array and increments it if a number greater than or equal to the current MEX is found. 

The program works for all cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It handles the cases where the input array contains duplicate elements, and it also handles the case where the input array contains a single element. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
