Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct based on the problem description provided. It calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

Here's a breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` as input.
2. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
3. It initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
4. The program then iterates through the sorted array `a`. For each number `num`, if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This is because `mex` should be the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
5. Finally, the program prints the maximum possible value of `mex`.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* By sorting the array, we can easily find the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
* If a number in the array is greater than or equal to `mex`, we can decrement it to a value smaller than `mex` without affecting the mex value. Therefore, we can always make the array have a mex value equal to the number of distinct elements in the array.
* The program correctly calculates the maximum possible mex value by iterating through the sorted array and incrementing `mex` whenever it encounters a number greater than or equal to `mex`.

Since the program seems to handle all possible cases correctly and matches the problem description, it appears to be correct. If a case is found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness would be **False**. However, after analyzing the program, no such case could be found, so the correctness remains **True**.
