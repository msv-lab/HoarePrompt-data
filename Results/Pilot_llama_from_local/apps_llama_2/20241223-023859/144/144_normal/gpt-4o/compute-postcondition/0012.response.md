The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `num` remains the third element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `mex` is increased by 1**
