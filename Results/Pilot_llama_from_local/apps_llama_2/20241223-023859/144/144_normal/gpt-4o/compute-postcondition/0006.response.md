The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mex` is 1, so the new value of `mex` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to the previous value of `mex` which was 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and `num` is greater than or equal to 1**
