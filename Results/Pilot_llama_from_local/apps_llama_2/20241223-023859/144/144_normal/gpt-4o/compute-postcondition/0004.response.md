According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `mex` is 1. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list `a`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
