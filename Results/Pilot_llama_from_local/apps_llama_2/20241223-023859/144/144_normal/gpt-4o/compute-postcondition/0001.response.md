The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string into an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer input by the user, it was already input before this line of code. Now, another input is taken and assigned to `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user**
