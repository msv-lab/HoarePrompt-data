The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mex` is unknown, but the states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `num` is still the second element in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `mex` is increased by 1**
