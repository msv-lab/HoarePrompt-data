According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 2 elements and the `num` is the second element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`**
