Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex` (which is initially 1), then `mex` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged (as there is no else part).***
