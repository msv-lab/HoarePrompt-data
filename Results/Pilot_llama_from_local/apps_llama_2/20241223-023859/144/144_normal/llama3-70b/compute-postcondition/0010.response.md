Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`, and `num` is not equal to `mex`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no additional actions are taken when `num` is not greater than `mex`, implying that `num` must be less than `mex` in such cases, but given `mex` is 1, this scenario is impossible as `num` is a positive integer and cannot be less than 1. Therefore, the postcondition essentially describes the state when `num` > `mex`, as the condition `num` ≤ `mex` cannot be satisfied under the given constraints.***
