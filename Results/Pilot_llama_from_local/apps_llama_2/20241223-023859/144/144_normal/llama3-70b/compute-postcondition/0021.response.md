Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`. If `num` equals the minimum excluded value (mex), then `mex` is increased by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is less than `mex`, the program continues its execution without any changes.***
