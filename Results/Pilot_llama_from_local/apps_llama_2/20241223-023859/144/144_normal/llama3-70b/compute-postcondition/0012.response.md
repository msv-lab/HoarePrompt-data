According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `arr` must have at least 2 elements and `num` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`**
