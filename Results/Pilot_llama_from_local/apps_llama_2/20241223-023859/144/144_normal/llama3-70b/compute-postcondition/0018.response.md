The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `n`, `arr`, and `num` remains unchanged, as the code only affects `mex`. Since the initial value of `mex` is not specified, we can only conclude that its value increases by 1.

The value of `n` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `arr` is still a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements. The value of `num` is still the third element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`, and `mex` is increased by 1**
