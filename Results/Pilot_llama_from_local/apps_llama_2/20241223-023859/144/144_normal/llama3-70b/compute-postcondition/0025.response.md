Functionality: **The function accepts a single positive integer n and a list of n positive integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the smallest positive integer (mex) not present in the sorted list. The function handles all potential edge cases, including duplicate numbers, numbers out of the specified range, and an empty list (although the input validation in the problem statement does not allow for the last case, the code itself can handle such a case if the input is provided). After the function concludes, the program state includes the input integer n and the list of numbers, which has been sorted, with the mex value printed as output. The function performs the following actions: input processing, list sorting, iteration over the sorted list to find the mex, and output of the mex value. The function does not modify the input integer n, but it does modify the list of numbers by sorting it. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer or a list of positive integers, as such cases are not specified in the problem statement.**
