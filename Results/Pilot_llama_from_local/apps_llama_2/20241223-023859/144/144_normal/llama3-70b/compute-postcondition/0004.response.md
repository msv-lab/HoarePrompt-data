According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `num`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order, and `mex` is 1. This ensures that the loop will execute because `arr` has at least 1 element. So, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
