Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, the current value of `num` is the first element in `arr`, `num` is not equal to `mex`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `mex`**
