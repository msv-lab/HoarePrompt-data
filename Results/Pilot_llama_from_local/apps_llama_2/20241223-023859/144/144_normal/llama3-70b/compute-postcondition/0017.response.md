According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `num` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`**
