The given code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

In the initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`. Since `num` is the third element in `arr`, we can also express `num` as `arr[2]`.

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `n`, `arr`, or `num`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[2]`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is `arr[2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
