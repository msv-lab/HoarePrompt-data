To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code checks each number `num` in the sorted list `arr`. If `num` equals the current minimum excluded value `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, as there's no need to continue checking the rest of the list because all subsequent numbers will also be greater than `mex` due to the list being sorted.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **`n` remains unchanged** as it's the size of the list `arr`, which doesn't change during the loop execution.
2. **`arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers**. This also doesn't change, but the loop's execution depends on its elements.
3. **`mex` starts at 1** and is incremented each time a number in `arr` equals the current `mex`. This means `mex` will keep incrementing as long as the numbers in `arr` match the sequence of natural numbers starting from 1.
4. **The loop breaks when it encounters a number greater than `mex`**. This is crucial because, after the break, `mex` represents the smallest positive integer not present in the list `arr` (or the first integer greater than all elements in `arr` if all smaller integers are present).

Considering these points, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can infer the following about the output state:

- **`n`** remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, as it doesn't change during the loop.
- **`arr`** is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers in ascending order.
- **`mex`** will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in `arr`. This is because the loop increments `mex` for each `num` in `arr` that equals the current `mex`, and it stops when it finds a `num` greater than `mex`, indicating that `mex` has reached the smallest value not in the list.
- **`num`** will be the last element in `arr` that was checked before the loop broke. However, since we're interested in the final state after all iterations, the specific value of `num` is less relevant than the state of `mex` and the unchanged nature of `n` and `arr`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is characterized by `n` and `arr` remaining as initially defined, with `mex` being the minimum excluded value (the smallest positive integer not in `arr`) after the loop's execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.**
