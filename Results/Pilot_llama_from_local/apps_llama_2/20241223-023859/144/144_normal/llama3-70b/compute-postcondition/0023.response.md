The given code prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. This operation does not modify the values of `n`, `arr`, or `mex`. It simply outputs the current value of `mex` to the console.

The value of `mex` is determined by the initial state as the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, a sorted list of `n` positive integers in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, and the value of `mex` has been printed.**
