Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`. If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken.***
