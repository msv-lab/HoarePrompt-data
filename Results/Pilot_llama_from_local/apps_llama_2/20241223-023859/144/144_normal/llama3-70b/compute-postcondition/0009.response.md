The code snippet is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. However, in this case, there is no loop or if statement provided in the snippet. Assuming it is part of a larger code block, the break statement will terminate the nearest enclosing loop or if statement.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element
- `mex` is 1
- The current value of `num` is the first element in `arr`
- `num` is not equal to `mex`
- The current value of `num` is greater than `mex`

The break statement does not directly modify any variables. Thus, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `num` is not equal to `mex`, `num` is greater than `mex`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
