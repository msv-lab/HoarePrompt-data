The code increments `mex` by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 1, so the new value of `mex` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, the first element in `arr` is `num`, `num` is 1, and `mex` is 2**
