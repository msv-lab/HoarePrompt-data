The provided code maps the input into integers and stores it in the `arr` list. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and a list of n positive integers is still to be processed, the input().split() function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and map(int,...) applies the int() function to each substring, converting them to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a list of n positive integers that have been input and are now stored as integers in the list**
