The code sets the value of `mex` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n` and `arr`. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `arr` is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order, `mex` is 1**
