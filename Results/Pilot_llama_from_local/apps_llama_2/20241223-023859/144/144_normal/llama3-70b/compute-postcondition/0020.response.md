Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`. If `num` is greater than the minimum excluded value (mex), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues its execution without any changes.**
