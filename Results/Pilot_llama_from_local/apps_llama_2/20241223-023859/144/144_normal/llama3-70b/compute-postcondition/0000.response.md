The input to the function consists of two lines, and we have executed the first line of code which is `n = int(input())`. 

In this line, `n` is assigned the value of the input, converted to an integer. 

So, `n` becomes an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.

The states of other variables are not affected.

However, note that the second line of the input which is a list of `n` positive integers has not been processed yet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000,  and a list of n positive integers is still to be processed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000,  and a list of n positive integers is still to be processed.**
