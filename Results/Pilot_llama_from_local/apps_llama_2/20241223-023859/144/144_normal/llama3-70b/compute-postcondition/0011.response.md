Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `arr`. If `num` equals `mex` (which is initially 1), then `num` is 1 and `mex` becomes 2. If `num` does not equal `mex`, given `mex` is 1, it implies `num` must be greater than `mex`, and in such cases, the loop or statement is exited without further modifications, maintaining `mex` as 1 and `num` as the first element of `arr` greater than `mex`.***
