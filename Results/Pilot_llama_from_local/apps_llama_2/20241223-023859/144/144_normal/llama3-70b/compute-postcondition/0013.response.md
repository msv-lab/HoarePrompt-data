The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `arr`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` remains a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `num` remains the second element in `arr`. The value of `mex` is now `mex + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`, and `mex` is `mex + 1`**
