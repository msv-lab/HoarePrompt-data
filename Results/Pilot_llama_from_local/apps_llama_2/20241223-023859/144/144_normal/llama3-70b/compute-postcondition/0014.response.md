The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which terminates the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the code snippet, we will assume it is inside a loop or conditional statement that is not shown.

The `break` statement does not modify any variables, so the values of `n`, `arr`, and `num` remain the same.

The value of `n` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
The value of `arr` is still a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
The value of `num` is still the second element in `arr`.

We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n positive integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
