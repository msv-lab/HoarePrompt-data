The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it implicitly accepts two lines of input. The first line is a single positive integer `n`, and the second line is a list of `n` positive integers. 

After executing the function body, the return value is not explicitly stated in the problem. Therefore, I will create a general description based on typical problems of this type.

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept a single positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, and return a value based on the input list.


Functionality: **The function accepts a single positive integer n and a list of n positive integers and returns a value based on the input list.**
