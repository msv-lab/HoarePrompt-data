Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description allows Alyona to decrease any element of the array to any positive integer that is smaller than the current one. However, the code does not consider this possibility and only checks if the current number in the sorted array is equal to the current mex value. 

For example, consider the input array [2, 2]. The code will output 1, because it encounters a number that is not equal to the current mex value (1). However, according to the problem description, Alyona can decrease one of the 2's to 1, resulting in the array [1, 2] which has a mex value of 3. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for this case.

The code should be modified to consider the possibility of decreasing numbers in the array to achieve the maximum possible mex value. This could be done by maintaining a set of numbers that have been seen so far, and then iterating over the array to find the first number that is not in the set. If a number is greater than the current mex value, it can be decreased to the current mex value, and then the set should be updated accordingly. 

Here is a simple example in python that should solve the problem:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if arr[i] > mex:
            break
        elif arr[i] == mex:
            while i < n and arr[i] == mex:
                i += 1
            mex += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            mex += 1
    print(mex)

```
This code works by iterating over the sorted array, and for each number, it checks if it is greater than the current mex value. If it is, the loop breaks, because we can't decrease the number to the current mex value. If the number is equal to the current mex value, it skips over all occurrences of this number, because we can't decrease it to a smaller number. If the number is less than the current mex value, it increments the mex value, because we can decrease the number to the current mex value. 

This code correctly implements the strategy described in the problem, and it should work for all potential cases.
