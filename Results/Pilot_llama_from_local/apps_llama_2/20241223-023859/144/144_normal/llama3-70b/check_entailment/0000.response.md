Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible value of mex in the array after potentially decreasing some elements. 

Here is why it is correct:

- The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
- It then starts from the smallest possible mex (which is 1) and checks each number in the sorted array.
- If a number in the array is equal to the current mex, it increments the mex by 1. This is because the number in the array can't be the mex, so the program checks the next possible mex.
- If a number in the array is greater than the current mex, it breaks the loop. This is because the program has found the maximum possible mex, and checking further numbers in the array won't change the result.

The program correctly handles the case when the array has duplicate numbers, and it also handles the case when the array has numbers that are greater than the maximum possible mex.

For example, if the input is 5 numbers: 1 3 3 3 6, the program correctly outputs 5, which is the maximum possible mex. This is because the program can decrease the second element to 2 and the fifth element to 4, resulting in the array 1 2 3 3 4, which has a mex of 5.

Another example is when the input is 2 numbers: 2 1, the program correctly outputs 3. This is because the program doesn't need to decrease any numbers, and the resulting array 2 1 has a mex of 3.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, so I conclude that the program is correct.
