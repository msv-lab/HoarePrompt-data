Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the problem description. It calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. 

The program works by first sorting the input array in ascending order. It then initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array. 

The program iterates over the sorted array, and for each number, it checks if the number is equal to the current `mex`. If it is, it increments `mex` by 1. If the number is greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop because any number greater than `mex` won't affect the `mex` value.

The program then prints the `mex` value, which is the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.

This program works correctly for all cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex by iterating over the sorted array and checking for the presence of each positive integer. 

For instance, if the input array is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the program will output `5`, which is correct because if Alyona decreases the second element to 2 and the fifth element to 4, the resulting array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]` has a mex value of 5.

Similarly, if the input array is `[2, 1]`, the program will output `3`, which is also correct because if Alyona doesn't decrease any of the array elements, the resulting array `[1, 2]` has a mex value of 3.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including cases where the input array is empty or contains duplicate elements. 

In conclusion, the program is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.
