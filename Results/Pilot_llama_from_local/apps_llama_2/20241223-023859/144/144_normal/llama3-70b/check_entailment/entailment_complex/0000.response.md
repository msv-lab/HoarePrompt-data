Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations. The mex of an array is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in this array.

The program does the following:

1.  It reads the number of elements in the array `n` and the array itself.
2.  It sorts the array in ascending order.
3.  It initializes the variable `mex` to 1, which is the smallest positive integer.
4.  It then iterates over the sorted array. If it finds a number that is equal to the current `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. If it finds a number that is greater than the current `mex`, it breaks the loop because all subsequent numbers will also be greater than `mex`.

This process effectively finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array, which is the definition of mex. The program then prints this value.

The program's logic is sound because it correctly implements the definition of mex and accounts for the possibility of Alyona applying operations to the array. The operations that Alyona can apply (decreasing the value of any element) do not change the fact that the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array is the mex.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is guaranteed for every potential case.
