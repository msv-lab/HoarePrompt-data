Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers as input: n, k, and t, where k is less than or equal to n, and t is greater than or equal to 1 and less than n + k. It then returns the minimum value between t and k if t is less than or equal to n; otherwise, it returns k minus the remainder of (t - n) divided by k. The function performs a single calculation based on the input values and prints the result, effectively providing a mathematical operation that depends on the relative values of the input parameters.**
