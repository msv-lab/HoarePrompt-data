The code snippet uses an if-else conditional statement to print the minimum of `t` and `k` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it prints the result of `k - (t - n) % k`.

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `min(t, k)` is evaluated if `t <= n`. This expression returns the smaller of `t` and `k`.
2. If `t > n`, then `k - (t - n) % k` is evaluated. Here, `(t - n) % k` calculates the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k`, and then `k` is subtracted from this remainder.

Given the initial state: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer.

The output of the print statement will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

If `t <= n`, the output will be `min(t, k)`, which is the smaller of `t` and `k`. 
If `t > n`, the output will be `k - (t - n) % k`.

Since the code only contains a print statement, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and a value has been returned which is `min(t, k)` if `t <= n` else `k - (t - n) % k`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and a value has been returned which is `min(t, k)` if `t <= n` else `k - (t - n) % k`.**
