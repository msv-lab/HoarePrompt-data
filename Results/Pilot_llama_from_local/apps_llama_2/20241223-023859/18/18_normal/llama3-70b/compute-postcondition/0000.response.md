The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values from the input to `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns them as a map object which is then unpacked into `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

Given that initially `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, and `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t < n + k`, these conditions are not necessarily valid after the code execution because the new values of `n`, `k`, and `t` come from the input and may not satisfy these conditions. 

However, since `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned values from the input, we can say that `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer**
