The function `func` seems to be missing parameters based on the provided constraints. Given the constraints, the function should accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < `n` + `k`. However, without the actual output description, we can only describe the parameter acceptance part of the functionality. Assuming the output is not provided, the functionality description would focus on the parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, where n, k, and t are positive integers, k is less than or equal to n, and t is greater than or equal to 1 and less than n + k.**
