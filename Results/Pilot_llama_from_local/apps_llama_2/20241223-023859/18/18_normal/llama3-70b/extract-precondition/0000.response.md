To accurately describe the input variables and their relationships, we need to consider the parameters that would typically be involved in a function designed to calculate the number of spectators standing at a given time `t`, based on the problem description provided.

Given the problem statement involves `n` spectators, a wave interval `k`, and a time `t`, we should expect these variables to be part of the function's parameters. However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not explicitly mention these parameters. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume the function should take `n`, `k`, and `t` as parameters, thus the function definition should ideally be something like `def func(n, k, t):`.

Precondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, and t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t < n + k.**
