Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly calculate the number of spectators standing at time t. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- If t is less than or equal to n, the number of standing spectators is at most k (the wave height) and is increasing until it reaches k. The expression `min(t, k)` correctly calculates this, as it will be t until t reaches k, and then it will be k.

- If t is greater than n, the wave has reached its height and the front of the wave is now moving backwards. The expression `k - (t - n) % k` correctly calculates the number of standing spectators, as `(t - n) % k` gives the "distance" the wave has moved back since it reached the end, and subtracting this from k gives the number of spectators still standing.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where t is exactly equal to n or where t is a multiple of k. 

Overall, the program seems to accurately model the Mexican wave and calculate the number of spectators standing at time t for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is True.
