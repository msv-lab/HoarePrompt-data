Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to accurately implement the logic required to solve the Mexican wave problem. It takes into account the total number of spectators (`n`), the wave duration (`k`), and the time at which the spectator count is needed (`t`).

For every potential case:

1. When `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the function correctly returns the minimum value between `t` and `k`, because up to time `n`, the number of standing spectators is the minimum between the current time and the wave duration (`k`).
2. When `t` is greater than `n`, the function correctly returns `k - (t - n) % k`, which accounts for the fact that after time `n`, the spectators start sitting down in a cyclical manner. This expression gives the number of standing spectators at time `t` by subtracting the fractional part of the time elapsed after `n` (since it's cyclical) from the wave duration (`k`).

The provided output hints and examples also agree with the code's logic, demonstrating its correctness for different inputs. 

For instance, with `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the code returns `3`, which matches the expected output. Similarly, for `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7` or `t = 12`, the code returns `5` and `3` respectively, aligning with the problem description and examples.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., within the specified ranges and without any error-causing conditions), the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
