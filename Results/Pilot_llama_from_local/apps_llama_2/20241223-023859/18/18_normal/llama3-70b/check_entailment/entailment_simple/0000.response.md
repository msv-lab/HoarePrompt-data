### Analysis of the Program

The program is designed to calculate the number of spectators standing at time `t` in a Mexican wave scenario involving `n` spectators and a wave period of `k`. The input to the program consists of three integers: `n`, `k`, and `t`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`.

### Code Explanation

The code defines a function `func()` that reads the input integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, and then prints the result of the expression `min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k`. This expression is intended to calculate the number of spectators standing at time `t`.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's analyze the program's behavior based on the conditions given in the problem description:

1. **Initial Wave Phase (`t ≤ n`):** In this phase, the number of standing spectators increases with each time step, up to `k`. The expression `min(t, k)` correctly calculates the number of standing spectators, as it ensures that the count does not exceed `k` even if `t > k` but still within the `t ≤ n` condition.

2. **Wave Propagation and Return Phase (`t > n`):** After all `n` spectators have stood (`t > n`), the wave begins to move back, with the earlier spectators sitting down as the wave continues. The expression `k - (t - n) % k` is used to calculate the number of standing spectators during this phase.

    - The modulo operation `(t - n) % k` calculates the position within the wave cycle after the initial `n` spectators have stood.
    - Subtracting this from `k` gives the number of spectators still standing because it accounts for the decreasing number of standing spectators as the wave moves back.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for calculating the number of standing spectators at any given time `t` in the Mexican wave scenario. It handles both the initial increase in standing spectators and the subsequent decrease as the wave propagates and returns.

### Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases, correctly calculating the number of standing spectators at time `t` based on the given conditions and wave pattern.
