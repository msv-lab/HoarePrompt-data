Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. 

For `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is `min(t, k)`, which means either all `t` spectators are standing if `t <= k`, or `k` spectators are standing if `t > k`. 

For `t > n`, the number of standing spectators is `k - (t - n) % k`, which correctly represents the number of spectators standing at any time after `t > n`. 

The modulo operation `(t - n) % k` ensures that the cycle of standing and sitting spectators repeats every `k` time units after `t > n`. 

This aligns with the examples provided, where the program correctly outputs the expected number of standing spectators for various inputs of `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

I couldn't find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so the program is correct.
