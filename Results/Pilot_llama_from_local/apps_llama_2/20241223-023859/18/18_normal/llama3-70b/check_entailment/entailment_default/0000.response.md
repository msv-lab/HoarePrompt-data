Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. For the first n time units, the number of standing spectators is equal to the minimum of t and k, which makes sense since the spectators are standing one by one. After n time units, the number of standing spectators starts to decrease, and the code correctly calculates this by subtracting the remainder of (t - n) divided by k from k. 

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code. For instance, when n = 10, k = 5, and t = 3, the code outputs 3, which is correct since the first 3 spectators are standing at time 3. Similarly, when n = 10, k = 5, and t = 7, the code outputs 5, which is also correct since the first 5 spectators are standing at time 7.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the mathematical operations being performed. They also indicate that the function handles the different cases correctly, depending on whether t is less than or equal to n or greater than n.

Overall, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it seems that the code is correct and handles all potential cases as expected.
