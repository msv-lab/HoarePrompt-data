The function reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. It then prints a value based on the comparison of `t` with `k` and `n`. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. After execution, the function has printed a single integer value to the standard output, and the state of the program is that `n`, `k`, and `t` have been consumed from standard input, with no explicit return value. All potential cases are handled, including edge cases where `t` equals `k` or `n`, and the function does not modify the input values or maintain any internal state after execution.
