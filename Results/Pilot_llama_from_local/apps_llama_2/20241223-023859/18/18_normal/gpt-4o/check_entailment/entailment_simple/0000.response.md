Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the Mexican wave problem as described. It takes the input `n`, `k`, and `t` from standard input, and then uses conditional statements to determine the number of spectators standing at time `t`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints `t`, which is the number of spectators standing at that time. This is because in the first `k` time steps, each spectator stands one by one, so the number of standing spectators is equal to the current time step.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`, which is the maximum number of spectators standing at any given time. This is because at this point, `k` spectators are standing, and the first `t - k` spectators have already sat back down.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`, which is the number of spectators still standing at that time. This is because at this point, all `n` spectators have stood and sat back down, and the number of spectators still standing is decreasing by one each time step.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct number of spectators standing at time `t`, as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
