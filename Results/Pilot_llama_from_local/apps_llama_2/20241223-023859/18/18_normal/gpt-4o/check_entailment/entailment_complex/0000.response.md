Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

When `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program correctly prints `t`, as the number of spectators standing at time `t` is equal to `t`. 

When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program correctly prints `k`, as the number of spectators standing at this time is still `k`, because new spectators are standing and the spectators that stood up first are sitting, but the total number of standing spectators remains `k`.

When `t` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n + k - t`, as the number of spectators standing at this time is decreasing, and can be calculated by subtracting the time that has passed since the last spectator stood up (`t - n`) from `k`, which is effectively `n + k - t`.

Therefore, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
