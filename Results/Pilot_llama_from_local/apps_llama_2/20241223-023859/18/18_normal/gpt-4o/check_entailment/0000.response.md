Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the rules of the Mexican wave problem. 

Here's why:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that the wave has not yet reached its peak or is still growing. In this case, the number of standing spectators is equal to `t`.

- If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it means that the wave has reached its peak and is now steady. In this case, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`.

- If `t` is greater than `n`, it means that the wave is now receding. In this case, the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 for each time step past `n`. This is correctly implemented as `n + k - t`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. No edge cases are missing, and the code follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness is True.
