Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of standing spectators at time `t` in the Mexican wave scenario. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it's correct:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is `t`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand one by one, with the `t`-th spectator standing at time `t`.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is `k`. This is because once the first `k` spectators have stood, the `k`-th spectator remains standing, and the spectators in front of them start sitting down as the wave propagates. However, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` until time `n`, when the last spectator stands.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 for each unit of time. This is because once all spectators have stood, the wave starts propagating back, and the spectators who stood first start sitting down. The program calculates this by subtracting `t` from `n + k`, which gives the correct number of standing spectators at time `t`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the given examples demonstrate its accuracy. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and its correctness is confirmed.
