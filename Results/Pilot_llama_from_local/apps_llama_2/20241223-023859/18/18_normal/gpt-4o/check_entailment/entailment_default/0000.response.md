Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code correctly implements the logic to find the number of standing spectators at time `t`. The problem description outlines the behavior of the spectators over time, and the code accurately models this behavior. 

When `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand one by one.

When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`. This is because a new spectator stands at each time step, and a previously standing spectator sits down.

Finally, when `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases as previously standing spectators sit down. The correct number of standing spectators in this case is `n + k - t`.

The provided output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the code is correct. The code handles all potential cases, including edge cases where `t` equals `k` or `n`. Additionally, the code does not modify the input values or maintain any internal state after execution.

The examples given in the problem description also work correctly with this code. For instance, when `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the output is `3`, which is correct. Similarly, when `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the output is `5`, which is also correct. Lastly, when `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the output is `3`, which is again correct.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, it can be concluded that the code is correct for every potential case.
