Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples. It handles all potential cases by dividing them into three distinct conditions based on the comparison of `t` with `k` and `n`.

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the code prints `t`, which aligns with the initial phase of the Mexican wave where the number of standing spectators increases linearly with time.

- If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`, indicating the steady state where the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` because one spectator stands while another sits at the same time.

- If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`, which correctly calculates the decreasing number of standing spectators during the final phase of the wave.

All examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:

- For the input `10 5 3`, the output is `3`, which is correct because at time `3`, the first three spectators are standing.

- For the input `10 5 7`, the output is `5`, which is correct because at time `7`, the number of standing spectators has reached its maximum and is still `5`.

- For the input `10 5 12`, the output is `3`, which is correct because at time `12`, the wave has started to decrease, and only `3` spectators are standing.

The code directly addresses the problem without omitting any edge cases or potential scenarios, making it a comprehensive and correct solution to the problem description provided.
