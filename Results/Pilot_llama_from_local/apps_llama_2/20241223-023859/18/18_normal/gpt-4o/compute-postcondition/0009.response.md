Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `t` has been printed and returned. If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, then `k` has been printed. If `t` is larger than `n`, the value `n + k - t` has been printed.**
