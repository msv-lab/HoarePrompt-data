The code reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input string into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned the values of the three input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`**
