The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to read from standard input. The input from standard input consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, where `n`, `k`, and `t` are positive integers, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`. 

However, the return value of the function isn't explicitly stated in the problem. Thus, based on the information given, we can describe the functionality of the function as it relates to the input parameters from standard input.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from standard input, where `n`, `k`, and `t` adhere to the constraints 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`.**
