The print statement `print(n + k - t)` will output the value of the expression `n + k - t`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`, `t` is larger than `k`, and `t` is larger than `n`, 

The value of `n + k - t` can be negative because `t` is larger than both `n` and `k`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not changed by the print statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`, `t` is larger than `k`, and `t` is larger than `n`, and the value `n + k - t` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`, `t` is larger than `k`, and `t` is larger than `n`, and the value `n + k - t` has been printed.**
