The code `print(k)` prints the value of `k` but does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`. The states of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `t` is larger than `k` and less than `n` + `k`, and `k` has been printed**
