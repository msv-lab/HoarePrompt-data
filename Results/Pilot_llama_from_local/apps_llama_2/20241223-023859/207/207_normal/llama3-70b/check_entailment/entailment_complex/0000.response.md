Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The issue with the program is in the way it updates the `dp` array. 

In the problem description, `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The program, however, calculates the number of ways to reach each index by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, which is not the same as the number of distinct integers that can be reached.

The program also has a logical error in the way it updates the `dp` values. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it allows the frog to jump back to a position it has already visited, which is not in line with the problem description. The correct approach would be to only update `dp[i + a]` and not `dp[i]`.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly calculate `f(i)` for each `i`. It simply sums up all the `dp` values, which is not the same as calculating the sum of `f(i)` for each `i` from `0` to `m`. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a set of visited positions for each `i` from `0` to `m`, and calculate `f(i)` as the number of distinct positions in the set. We can then sum up all the `f(i)` values to get the final answer.

Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:

- Initialize a set of visited positions for each `i` from `0` to `m`.
- For each `i`, start from `0` and jump to all possible positions by adding `a` or subtracting `b`, as long as the new position is within the interval `[0, i]`.
- Add each new position to the set of visited positions for `i`.
- Calculate `f(i)` as the size of the set of visited positions for `i`.
- Sum up all the `f(i)` values to get the final answer.

The provided program does not follow this approach, and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
