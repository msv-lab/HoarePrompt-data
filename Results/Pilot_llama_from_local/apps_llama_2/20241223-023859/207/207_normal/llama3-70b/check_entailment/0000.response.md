Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided code is that it does not correctly implement the problem description. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it allows the frog to jump back to a position it has already visited, which can lead to overcounting.

For example, consider the case where `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`. The correct values for `f(i)` are `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 1`, `f(4) = 1`, `f(5) = 3`, `f(6) = 3`, and `f(7) = 8`. However, the provided code will not correctly calculate these values.

A correct implementation would use a different approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`. 

The provided code also does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime, which can also lead to incorrect results.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([0])
        visited.add(0)
        while queue:
            pos = queue.popleft()
            if pos + a <= i:
                if pos + a not in visited:
                    queue.append(pos + a)
                    visited.add(pos + a)
            if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b not in visited:
                queue.append(pos - b)
                visited.add(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(visited)
    print(total_sum)

func()
```
This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`, and correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime.
