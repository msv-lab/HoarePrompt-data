You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided code is that it does not correctly implement the problem description. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it allows the frog to jump back to a position it has already visited, which can lead to overcounting.

For example, consider the case where `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`. The correct values for `f(i)` are `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 1`, `f(4) = 1`, `f(5) = 3`, `f(6) = 3`, and `f(7) = 8`. However, the provided code will not correctly calculate these values.

A correct implementation would use a different approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`. 

The provided code also does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime, which can also lead to incorrect results.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([0])
        visited.add(0)
        while queue:
            pos = queue.popleft()
            if pos + a <= i:
                if pos + a not in visited:
                    queue.append(pos + a)
                    visited.add(pos + a)
            if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b not in visited:
                queue.append(pos - b)
                visited.add(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(visited)
    print(total_sum)

func()
```
This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`, and correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= m <= 10^9 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is an integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach `i` by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, with `dp[0]` being 1, and other `dp[i]` values updated accordingly based on the loop's rules.
    print(sum(dp))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
