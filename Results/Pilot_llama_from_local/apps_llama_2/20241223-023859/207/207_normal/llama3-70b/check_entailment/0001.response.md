Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it updates the `dp` array. 

In the line `if i - b >= 0: dp[i] += dp[i - b]`, the program is counting the number of ways to reach `i` by jumping back from `i + b` and adding it to the number of ways to reach `i`. However, this is incorrect because it's double-counting the number of ways to reach `i` by jumping back from positions that are reachable from `i - b`.

For example, consider `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`. When `i = 4`, the program will add `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, even though `i - b` is not within the range `[0, m]`.

To correctly implement this problem, we need to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached for each `i`. We can use a set to store these integers and update it accordingly.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reachable = {0}
        for _ in range(i + 1):
            new_reachable = set(reachable)
            for pos in reachable:
                if pos + a <= i:
                    new_reachable.add(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0:
                    new_reachable.add(pos - b)
            reachable = new_reachable
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the number of distinct integers that can be reached for each `i` and sums them up.

However, please note that this implementation may not be efficient for large inputs due to its time complexity. A more efficient solution would be to use dynamic programming to store the number of distinct integers that can be reached for each `i` and update it accordingly. 

For example:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [set() for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0] = {0}
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        for pos in dp[i]:
            if pos + a <= i:
                dp[pos + a].add(pos + a)
            if pos - b >= 0:
                dp[pos - b].add(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(dp[i])
    print(total_sum)
```
This implementation uses dynamic programming to store the number of distinct integers that can be reached for each `i` and updates it accordingly, resulting in a more efficient solution.
