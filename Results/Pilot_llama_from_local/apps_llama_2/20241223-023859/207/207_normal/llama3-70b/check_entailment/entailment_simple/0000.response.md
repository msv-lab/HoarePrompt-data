Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is updated.

In the problem description, `f(x)` is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The program attempts to calculate this using the DP table `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach `i` by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices.

However, the program does not correctly calculate `f(x)` for each `x`. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it allows the frog to jump to a position that has already been counted in the DP table, even if it's outside the interval `[0, i]`. This leads to overcounting and incorrect results.

A correct implementation would require a different approach, such as using a separate DP table to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached within the interval `[0, x]`, or using a different algorithm altogether.

For example, consider the input `7 5 3`. The program will calculate `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[5] = 1`, `dp[3] = 1`, `dp[6] = 2`, `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 1`, and `dp[7] = 4`, but it will not correctly calculate `f(x)` for each `x`. The correct values of `f(x)` for this input are `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 1`, `f(4) = 1`, `f(5) = 3`, `f(6) = 3`, and `f(7) = 8`, which sum to `19`. The program will not produce this correct result.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the problem description due to an incorrect update of the DP table, leading to overcounting and incorrect results.
