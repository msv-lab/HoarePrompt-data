You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided code is that it does not correctly implement the problem description. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it allows the frog to jump back to a position it has already visited, which can lead to overcounting.

For example, consider the case where `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`. The correct values for `f(i)` are `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 1`, `f(4) = 1`, `f(5) = 3`, `f(6) = 3`, and `f(7) = 8`. However, the provided code will not correctly calculate these values.

A correct implementation would use a different approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`. 

The provided code also does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime, which can also lead to incorrect results.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([0])
        visited.add(0)
        while queue:
            pos = queue.popleft()
            if pos + a <= i:
                if pos + a not in visited:
                    queue.append(pos + a)
                    visited.add(pos + a)
            if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b not in visited:
                queue.append(pos - b)
                visited.add(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(visited)
    print(total_sum)

func()
```
This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to calculate the reachable positions for each `i`, and correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints the total number of ways to reach all indices from 0 to `m` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. It initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` to track the number of ways to reach each index, with `dp[0]` set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 0 to `m`, updating `dp[i]` based on the rules defined in the loop. The final state of the program includes the printed sum of all values in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to reach all indices. The function handles edge cases where `i + a` exceeds `m` and `i - b` is less than 0 by only updating `dp` when these conditions are met. The function does not return any value, and its sole output is the printed sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
