The function calculates and prints the total number of ways to reach all indices from 0 to `m` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. It initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` to track the number of ways to reach each index, with `dp[0]` set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 0 to `m`, updating `dp[i]` based on the rules defined in the loop. The final state of the program includes the printed sum of all values in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to reach all indices. The function handles edge cases where `i + a` exceeds `m` and `i - b` is less than 0 by only updating `dp` when these conditions are met. The function does not return any value, and its sole output is the printed sum.
