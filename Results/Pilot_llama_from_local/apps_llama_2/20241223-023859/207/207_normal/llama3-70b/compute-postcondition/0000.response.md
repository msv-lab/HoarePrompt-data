The code `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` by taking an input string, splitting it into three parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning these integers to `m`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `m` = first input integer, `a` = second input integer, `b` = third input integer, and 1 <= `m`, `a`, `b` <= 10^5 is not guaranteed, but `m`, `a`, `b` are assigned the input integers**
