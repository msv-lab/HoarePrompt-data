The value of `dp[i]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - b]`. The initial state of `dp[i]` can be 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to `a` or not, and the initial state of `dp[i - b]` can also be 0 or 1 depending on whether `i - b` is equal to `a` or not. Since `i` is greater than or equal to `b`, `i - b` is less than or equal to `i` and greater than or equal to 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is 1 (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]` for the current `i`, and `i` is an integer and its current value is such that `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is 1 (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), and `i` is an integer and its current value is such that `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `i` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
