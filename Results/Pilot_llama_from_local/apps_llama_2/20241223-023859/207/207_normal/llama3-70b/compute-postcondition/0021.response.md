The given code prints the sum of all elements in the list `dp`. The `dp` list represents the number of ways to reach each index `i` by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices.

Output State: **`m` is an integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach `i` by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, with `dp[0]` being 1, the sum of `dp` has been returned and is equal to `sum(dp[0] + dp[1] +... + dp[m])`**
