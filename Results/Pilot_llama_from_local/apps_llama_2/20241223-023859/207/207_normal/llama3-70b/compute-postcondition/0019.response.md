Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than the original `i`, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is increased by `dp[i - b]`. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its old value plus the new value of `dp[i]`. If `i - b` is less than 0, then `dp` and other variables remain unchanged.***
