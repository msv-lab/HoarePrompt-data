The value of `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` is initially 1 when `i` equals 0, so `dp[a]` is incremented by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where initially `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1 (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), and `dp[i]` is 0 for `i` ranging from 1 to `m` excluding `a` (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), `i` is an integer and its current value is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1 (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), and `dp[i]` is 0 for `i` ranging from 1 to `m` excluding `a` (if `a` is less than or equal to `m`), `i` is an integer and its current value is 0.**
