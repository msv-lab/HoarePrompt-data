The given code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The initial state provides that `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from input values.

- `m` is an integer from the first input integer,
- `a` is an integer from the second input integer,
- `b` is an integer from the third input integer.

Given this, the code's impact is that it introduces a new variable `dp` which is a list of `m + 1` zeros. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros**
