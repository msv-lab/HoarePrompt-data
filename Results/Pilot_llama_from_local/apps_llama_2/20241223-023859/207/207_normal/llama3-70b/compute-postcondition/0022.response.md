The function `func` does not accept any parameters `m`, `a`, or `b` as the function definition is given as `def func():` which implies that it does not take any arguments. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is expected to operate under the conditions that `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 10^9 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^5. But as the function definition does not include these parameters, the description of its functionality must reflect this.

Given that there are no specified outputs or return values provided for this function, and considering the constraints on `m`, `a`, and `b` which are not parameters of the function, it's not possible to accurately describe the return value or the specific functionality of the function based on the information provided.

However, following the format and requirements as closely as possible:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value or functionality cannot be determined based on the provided information.**
