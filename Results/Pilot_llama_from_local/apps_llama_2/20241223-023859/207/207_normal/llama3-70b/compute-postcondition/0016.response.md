To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `m` is greater than `i`.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`.
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
dp[i + a] += dp[i]
```
This line of code affects the `dp` list by adding the value currently at index `i` to the value at index `i + a`. 

Given that `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, we can infer that the increment operation has already occurred before this line of code is executed. Thus, `i` in this context refers to its updated value.

After executing the given line of code:
- The value of `dp` at index `i + a` is increased by the value of `dp` at index `i`.
- The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and the list `dp` (except for the specific index `i + a`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` is greater than `i` and the definitions of `a` and `b` as input integers are still valid.

Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than `i`, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i + a]` equals its old value plus `dp[i]`, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.

Output State: **`m` is greater than `i`, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i + a]` equals its old value plus `dp[i]`, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**
