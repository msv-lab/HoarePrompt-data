The value of `dp[i]` is increased by `dp[i - b]`. The value of `m` is greater than the original `i`, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its old value plus `dp[i]`, but this condition is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than the original `i`, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` is increased by `dp[i - b]`, If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its old value plus the new value of `dp[i]`.**
