The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, which are the input parameters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the GCD of the original `x` and `y` is returned. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `y` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `x`), and when `x` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `y`). The absolute value of the result is implied to be returned, but as the inputs are non-negative integers and the GCD operation does not produce negative results for such inputs, the result is effectively the GCD itself without needing to explicitly calculate an absolute value. The function does not modify the input variables `x` and `y` outside of its local scope.
