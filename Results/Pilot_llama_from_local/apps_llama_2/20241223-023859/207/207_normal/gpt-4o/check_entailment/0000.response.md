Correctness: **True**.

The program provided seems to correctly calculate the sum of all f(i) for i from 0 to m. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The code defines a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is used to handle cases where the GCD of a and b is not 1.

2. The main function `func_2` first calculates the GCD of a and b using `func_1`. If the GCD is not 1, it recursively calls itself with the values of a, b, and m divided by the GCD. This is because the problem can be reduced to a simpler case where the GCD of a and b is 1.

3. If the GCD of a and b is 1, it calculates the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. It first calculates the sum for i from 0 to k (where k = a + b - 1), which is simply the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers. Then it calculates the sum for i from k+1 to m, which is the sum of the first m+1 natural numbers minus the sum of the first k natural numbers.

4. The code correctly handles cases where m is less than k, and where m is greater than or equal to k.

I have tested this function with the provided examples, and it produces the correct output in each case. Without being able to find a counter-example, I conclude that the program is correct. 

However, please note that a formal proof of correctness would require more rigorous analysis, including a detailed examination of the code's logic and the mathematical properties of the problem being solved. But based on my analysis and testing, the code appears to be correct.
