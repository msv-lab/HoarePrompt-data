Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to accurately implement the problem description. The function `func_2` calculates the sum of all `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`.

Here's a breakdown of why the code seems correct:

1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is used in `func_2` to handle cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime.

2. In `func_2`, if the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, and multiplies the result by `g`. This is a correct approach to handle cases where `a` and `b` have a common divisor.

3. When the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, the function checks if `m` is less than `a + b - 1`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, which is correct because the frog can only reach positions from `0` to `m` in this case.

4. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the function calculates and returns the sum of two series: one from `1` to `a + b - 1` and another from `a + b - 1` to `m`. This is also correct, as the frog can reach all positions from `0` to `m` in this case.

The provided examples in the problem description also match the output of the code, further supporting the correctness of the implementation. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly.
