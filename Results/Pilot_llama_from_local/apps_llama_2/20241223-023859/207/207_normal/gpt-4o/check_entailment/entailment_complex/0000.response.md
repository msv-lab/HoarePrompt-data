Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correctly implemented based on the problem description. The main function `func_2` calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to `m`. 

The code first calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` using the function `func_1`. If the GCD is not equal to 1, it recursively calls `func_2` with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by the GCD. This is because the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD.

If the GCD is equal to 1, it calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to `m`. If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of two series: one from 1 to `a + b - 1` and another from `a + b - 1` to `m`.

The code correctly handles the edge cases such as when `m` equals 0, or when `a` and `b` are at their minimum values (1). It also correctly adjusts its calculations based on these scenarios.

The provided examples also match the expected output of the code. For instance, the example with input `7 5 3` correctly returns `19`, which is the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to 7.

Therefore, based on the problem description, code annotations, and examples, the code seems to be correct and works as expected for every potential case.
