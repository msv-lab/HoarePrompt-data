Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be correct. The annotated version of the code further supports this conclusion. The program's logic and calculations align with the mathematical principles underlying the problem, and it handles various scenarios as described in the problem statement.

The function `func_1(x, y)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is essential for simplifying the problem when `a` and `b` are not coprime.

The function `func_2(m, a, b)` recursively calculates the sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m`, handling cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD. When `a` and `b` are coprime, it calculates the sum using the formula derived from the properties of arithmetic sequences.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program's logic and calculations are correct, and it handles potential edge cases such as when `m` equals 0, or when `a` and `b` are at their minimum values (1).

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

The reasons why I think the original assessment is accurate are:

1. The program's logic and calculations align with the mathematical principles underlying the problem.
2. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the program's logic and calculations.
3. The program handles various scenarios as described in the problem statement, including cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime.

Final: **True**
