Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Calculating GCD**: The `func_1` calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is necessary to simplify the problem by reducing `a` and `b` to their simplest form.

2. **Simplifying the problem**: In `func_2`, the program checks if the GCD (`g`) of `a` and `b` is not equal to 1. If it's not equal to 1, the problem can be simplified by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. This is because the GCD represents the minimum step size that the frog can move, and by dividing by `g`, we can reduce the problem to a simpler one where the minimum step size is 1.

3. **Base case**: If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. This is because in this case, the frog can only reach `m + 1` distinct integers (from 0 to `m`).

4. **General case**: If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the program calculates the sum of distinct integers that the frog can reach. This is done by calculating the sum of the first `a + b - 1` positive integers (`sum_k`) and adding it to the sum of integers from `a + b - 1` to `m` (`sum_m`). The formula for `sum_m` is `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 2) * (a + b - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of integers from `a + b - 1` to `m`.

The program always follows the problem description because:

* It correctly calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` and simplifies the problem accordingly.
* It handles the base case where `m` is less than `a + b - 1` correctly.
* It calculates the sum of distinct integers that the frog can reach in the general case correctly.

Overall, the program is correctly implemented and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
