The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations. The program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior and confirms that the program is functioning as expected. The states described in the annotations match the expected behavior of the program, and the calculations performed in the program align with the mathematical principles underlying the problem.

The program's use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the problem when `a` and `b` are not coprime is a key aspect of its correctness. The recursive call to `func_2` with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by their GCD is a clever way to reduce the problem to a simpler case, and the multiplication of the result by the GCD is necessary to obtain the correct answer.

The calculations performed in the `func_2` function also appear to be correct. The use of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate `sum_k` and `sum_m` is a efficient way to compute the desired sum, and the handling of the cases where `m` is less than or greater than `k` is correct.

Overall, based on the problem description, code, and annotations, the program appears to be correct, and the original assessment of **True** is maintained.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the program correctly implements the required logic, and the annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected. The program's use of the GCD to simplify the problem and its calculations for `sum_k` and `sum_m` are correct, and the handling of different cases is proper.

Final: **True**
