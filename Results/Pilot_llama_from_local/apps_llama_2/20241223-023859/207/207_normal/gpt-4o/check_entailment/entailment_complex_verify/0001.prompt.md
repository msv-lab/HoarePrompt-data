You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples. Here's a breakdown of why the program seems to work correctly:

- Function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard method for finding the GCD, which is essential for simplifying the problem when `a` and `b` are not coprime.

- Function `func_2(m, a, b)` handles the main logic of calculating the sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m`. If `a` and `b` are not coprime (i.e., their GCD is not `1`), the function recursively simplifies the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD. This step is crucial because it reduces the problem to a simpler case where `a` and `b` are coprime, which is easier to analyze.

- When `a` and `b` are coprime, the program calculates the sum of `f(i)` using the formula derived from the properties of arithmetic sequences. The calculation involves two parts: `sum_k` and `sum_m`. The first part, `sum_k`, calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers, where `k = a + b - 1`. This corresponds to the scenario where `m` is less than `k`, in which case the frog can only reach positions up to `m`.

- The second part, `sum_m`, calculates the sum of integers from `k+1` to `m`, considering that the frog can now reach positions up to `m` by making jumps of `a` and `-b`. This part of the calculation is also correct, as it takes into account the fact that the frog can reach more positions as `m` increases.

Given the provided examples, the program produces the correct output, which further supports its correctness.

Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to produce the expected result according to the problem description, we must conclude that the program is correct. The program's logic and calculations align with the mathematical principles underlying the problem, and it handles various scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the absolute value of x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, which are the input parameters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the GCD of the original `x` and `y` is returned. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `y` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `x`), and when `x` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `y`). The absolute value of the result is implied to be returned, but as the inputs are non-negative integers and the GCD operation does not produce negative results for such inputs, the result is effectively the GCD itself without needing to explicitly calculate an absolute value. The function does not modify the input variables `x` and `y` outside of its local scope.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer and a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where m is a non-negative integer, a and b are positive integers, and g is the result of func_1(a, b) which is not equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The value of `g` is equal to 1.
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, where `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` serves as a recursive calculator that accepts three parameters: a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`. Based on the values of these parameters and the result of `func_1(a, b)`, it calculates and returns a value. If `func_1(a, b)` does not equal 1, it recursively calls itself with parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g` (where `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`) and multiplies the result by `g`. When `func_1(a, b)` equals 1, it then checks if `m` is less than `a + b - 1`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one from 1 to `a + b - 1` and another from `a + b - 1` to `m`. The function handles potential edge cases such as when `m` equals 0, or when `a` and `b` are at their minimum values (1), and correctly adjusts its calculations based on these scenarios. Additionally, it handles the case when `a` and `b` are both 1, where `g` will be 1, and `m` will be directly used to calculate the sum. However, the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-zero and non-negative value, and its behavior may be undefined if this assumption is not met. Overall, the function provides a way to calculate complex sums based on recursive division and summation formulas, handling various input scenarios and edge cases.
