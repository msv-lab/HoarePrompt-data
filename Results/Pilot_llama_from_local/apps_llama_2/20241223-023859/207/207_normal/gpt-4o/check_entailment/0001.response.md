Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples. Here's a breakdown of why the program seems to work correctly:

- Function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard method for finding the GCD, which is essential for simplifying the problem when `a` and `b` are not coprime.

- Function `func_2(m, a, b)` handles the main logic of calculating the sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m`. If `a` and `b` are not coprime (i.e., their GCD is not `1`), the function recursively simplifies the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD. This step is crucial because it reduces the problem to a simpler case where `a` and `b` are coprime, which is easier to analyze.

- When `a` and `b` are coprime, the program calculates the sum of `f(i)` using the formula derived from the properties of arithmetic sequences. The calculation involves two parts: `sum_k` and `sum_m`. The first part, `sum_k`, calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers, where `k = a + b - 1`. This corresponds to the scenario where `m` is less than `k`, in which case the frog can only reach positions up to `m`.

- The second part, `sum_m`, calculates the sum of integers from `k+1` to `m`, considering that the frog can now reach positions up to `m` by making jumps of `a` and `-b`. This part of the calculation is also correct, as it takes into account the fact that the frog can reach more positions as `m` increases.

Given the provided examples, the program produces the correct output, which further supports its correctness.

Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to produce the expected result according to the problem description, we must conclude that the program is correct. The program's logic and calculations align with the mathematical principles underlying the problem, and it handles various scenarios as described in the problem statement.
