Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to m, given the constraints that the frog can jump a or b units. The code first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the func_1 function, which is a standard method for calculating GCD.

If the GCD is not 1, the code recursively calls func_2 with the parameters m, a, and b divided by the GCD, and multiplies the result by the GCD. This is a valid approach because if the GCD of a and b is not 1, it means that the frog's jumps can be reduced to a smaller scale.

If the GCD is 1, the code checks if m is less than a + b - 1. If true, it returns the sum of the first m + 1 positive integers, which is a valid result because the frog can only reach positions 0 through m.

If m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1, the code calculates and returns the sum of two series: one from 1 to a + b - 1 and another from a + b - 1 to m. This is a valid result because the frog can reach positions 0 through a + b - 1 in the first series, and positions a + b - 1 through m in the second series.

The code handles potential edge cases such as when m equals 0, or when a and b are at their minimum values (1), and correctly adjusts its calculations based on these scenarios. Additionally, it handles the case when a and b are both 1, where the GCD will be 1, and m will be directly used to calculate the sum.

The provided examples in the problem description also match the results produced by the code, which further confirms its correctness. Therefore, the code appears to be correct and should produce the desired output for every potential case.
