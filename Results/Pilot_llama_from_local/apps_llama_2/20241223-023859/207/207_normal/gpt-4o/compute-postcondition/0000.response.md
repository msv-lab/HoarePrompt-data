The code assigns the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `g`. The initial state states that `m` is a non-negative integer and `a` and `b` are positive integers. 

Since the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot directly calculate its result. However, we can still express the output state based on the given information.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
