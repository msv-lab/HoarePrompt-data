The code assigns the value of `a + b - 1` to `k`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g` are not affected by this operation. 

Given that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a positive integer, the value of `k` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (since the minimum value for both `a` and `b` is 1, resulting in `k = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1`).

The output state remains the same for `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g`, with `g` still equal to 1.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
