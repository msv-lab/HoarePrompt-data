Given the initial state where `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` equals 1, `k` equals `a + b - 1`, and `m` is less than `k`, we are to determine the output state of the program after executing the given Python code.

The code provided is:
```python
return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
```

This code calculates and returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms in the series. In this case, `n` is equivalent to `m + 1`.

Given that `m` is a non-negative integer less than `k`, where `k = a + b - 1`, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers, we can infer the following:

- The minimum value of `k` is 2 (when `a = 1` and `b = 1`), making the maximum value of `m` at least 1, since `m` must be less than `k`.
- Since `m` is non-negative and less than `k`, and given that `k` can be any value greater than or equal to 2 (depending on `a` and `b`), `m` can take any non-negative integer value up to `k - 1`.

However, the exact value of `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2` depends on the specific value of `m`. Without knowing the exact values of `a` and `b`, and thus the exact value of `k` and the constraint it imposes on `m`, we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for the return statement.

But we can describe it as follows: The program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, where `m` is a non-negative integer less than `a + b - 1`, with `a` and `b` being positive integers.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, where `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`.**
