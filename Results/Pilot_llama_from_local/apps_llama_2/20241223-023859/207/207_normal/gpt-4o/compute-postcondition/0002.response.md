The value of `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` which is not equal to 1. 

The program returns the result of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`. Here, `m // g` is the integer division of `m` by `g`, `a // g` is the integer division of `a` by `g`, and `b // g` is the integer division of `b` by `g`. 

Since `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` and is not equal to 1, and `a` and `b` are positive integers, we can't determine the exact values of `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g` without knowing the implementation of `func_1(a, b)`. However, we can say that the program returns the result of `func_2` (with the specified parameters) multiplied by `g`, where `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` and is not equal to 1.

Output State: **The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where m is a non-negative integer, a and b are positive integers, and g is the result of func_1(a, b) which is not equal to 1**
