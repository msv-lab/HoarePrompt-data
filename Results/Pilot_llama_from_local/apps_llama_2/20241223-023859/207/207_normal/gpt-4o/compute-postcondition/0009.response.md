To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `g` is equal to 1
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`
- `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
```

This code calculates the value of `sum_m` based on the values of `m` and `k`.

Let's break it down:
- `m * (m + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of integers from 0 to `m`.
- `k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of integers from 0 to `k-1`.
- Subtracting the latter from the former effectively calculates the sum of integers from `k` to `m`.

Since `k` is equal to `a + b - 1` and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, the expression `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2` essentially calculates the sum of integers from `a + b - 1` to `m`.

Given that `sum_k` equals `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, which represents the sum of the first `a + b - 1` positive integers, and knowing `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, the new variable `sum_m` is introduced and calculated based on `m` and `k`.

The output state, considering the initial conditions and the effect of the code, is:
- `m` is a non-negative integer and is greater than or equal to `k`
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `g` is equal to 1
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`
- `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`, representing the sum of integers from `k` to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` equals 1, `k` equals `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sum_k` equals `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, and `sum_m` equals `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`.**
