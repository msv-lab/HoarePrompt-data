The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. `m` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, the return value is determined by the following cases: 
1. If `g` (the result of `func_1(a, b)`) is not equal to 1, the function returns the result of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`. 
2. If `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`, the function returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. 
3. If `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the function returns `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `m` and positive integers `a` and `b`, and return a value based on the conditions related to the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, where m is a non-negative integer and a and b are positive integers, and returns a value based on the conditions related to the values of m, a, b, and the result of func_1(a, b).**
