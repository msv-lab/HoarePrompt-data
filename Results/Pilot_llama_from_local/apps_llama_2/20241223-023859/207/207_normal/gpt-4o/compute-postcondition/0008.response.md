The code calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers and assigns it to `sum_k`. Since `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, the value of `sum_k` can be expressed as `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`**
